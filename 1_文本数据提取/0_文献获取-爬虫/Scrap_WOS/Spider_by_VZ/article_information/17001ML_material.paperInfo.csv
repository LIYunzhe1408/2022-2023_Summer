1,Machine learning-based modeling and operation for ALD of SiO2 thin-films using data from a multiscale CFD simulation,151,,131-145,"Ding Yangyao,Zhang Yichi,Ren Yi Ming,Orkoulas Gerassimos,Christofides Panagiotis D.","Ding YY,Zhang YC,Ren YM,Orkoulas G,Christofides PD",Christofides PD,10.1016/j.cherd.2019.09.005,University of California System,"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a widely utilized deposition technology in the semiconductor industry due to its superior ability to generate highly conformal films and to deposit materials into high aspect-ratio geometric structures. However, ALD experiments remain expensive and time-consuming, and the existing first-principles based models have not yet been able to provide solutions to key process outputs that are computationally efficient, which is necessary for on-line optimization and real-time control. In this work, a multiscale data-driven model is proposed and developed to capture the macroscopic process domain dynamics with a linear parameter varying model, and to characterize the microscopic domain film growth dynamics with a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The multiscale data-driven model predicts the transient deposition rate from the following four key process operating parameters that can be manipulated, measured or estimated by process engineers: precursor feed flow rate, operating pressure, surface heating, and transient film coverage. Our results demonstrate that the multiscale data-driven model can efficiently characterize the transient input-output relationship for the SiO2 thermal ALD process using bis(tertiary-butylamino)silane (BTBAS) as the Si precursor. The multiscale data-driven model successfully reduces the computational time from 0.6 to 1.2 h for each time step, which is required for the first-principles based multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, to less than 0.1 s, making its real-time usage feasible. The developed data-driven modeling methodology can be further generalized and used for other thermal ALD or similar deposition systems, which will greatly enhance the feasibility of industrial manufacturing processes.

2,Automatic damage type classification and severity quantification using signal based and nonlinear model based damage sensitive features,83,,136-146,"Ghrib Meriem,Rebillat Marc,des Roches Guillaume Vermot,Mechbal Nazih","Ghrib M,Rebillat M,des Roches GV,Mechbal N",Rebillat M,10.1016/j.jprocont.2018.08.002,Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology designed to automate the inspection process undertaken to assess the health condition of structures. The SHM process is classically decomposed into four sequential steps: damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. This paper addresses damage type classification and severity quantification issues as classification problems whereby each class corresponds to a given damage type or a certain damage extent. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to perform multi-class classification task. Classically, Signal Based Features (SBF) are used to train SVMs when approaching SHM from a machine learning perspective. In this work, starting from the assumption that damage causes a structure to exhibit nonlinear response, it is investigated whether the use of Nonlinear Model Based Features (NMBF) increases classification performance. NMBF are computed based on parallel Hammerstein models which are identified with an Exponential Sine Sweep (ESS) signal. A study of the sensitivity of classification performance to the noise contained in output signals is also conducted. Dimension reduction of features vector using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is carried out in order to find out if it allows robustifying the classification/quantification process suggested in this work. Simulated data on a cantilever beam with various damage types and severities as well as experimental data coming from a composite aeronautic plate with various damage severities generated with a unique and original laser process are considered for demonstration. For both application cases, results show that by introducing NMBF, classification performance is improved. Furthermore, PCA allows for high recognition rates while reducing features vector dimension.

However, there can be no doubt that inspecting defects on steel surface is always a data-limited task due to difficult sample collection and expensive expert labeling. Unlike the previous works in which only labeled samples are treated using supervised classifiers, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) defect classification approach based on multi-training of two different networks: a categorized generative adversarial network (GAN) and a residual network. This method uses the GAN to generate a large number of unlabeled samples. And then the multitraining algorithm that uses two classifiers based on different learning strategies is proposed to integrate both labeled and unlabeled into SSL process. Finally, through the multiple training process, our SSL method can acquire higher accuracy and better robustness than the supervised one using only limited labeled samples. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving the classification accuracy of 99.56%.","Defect classification,Steel surface inspection,Semi-supervised learning,Generative adversarial network,Multi-training",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Optics,,4.894,"LOCAL,BINARY,PATTERNS,RECOGNITION",OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0143816619306499,

Here we test the hypothesis that a machine learning approach can distinguish grade 1 from higher gradings in meningioma patients using radiomics features derived from a heterogenous multicenter dataset of multi-paramedic MRI.
Methods: A total of 138 patients from 5 international centers that underwent MRI prior to surgical resection of intracranial meningiomas were included. Segmentation was performed manually on co-registered multi-parametric MR images using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1c), subtraction maps (Sub, T1c - T1), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted (T2) images. Feature selection was performed and using cross-validation to separate training from testing data, four machine learning classifiers were scored on combinations of MRI modalities: random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP).
Results: The best AUC of 0.97 (1.0 and 0.97 for sensitivity and specificity) was observed for the combination of ADC, ADC of the peritumoral edema, T1, T1c, Sub and FLAIR-derived features using only 16 of the 10,914 possible features and XGBoost.
Conclusions: Machine learning using radiomics features derived from multi-parametric MRI is capable of high AUC scores with high sensitivity and specificity in classifying meningiomas between low and higher gradings despite heterogeneous protocols across different centers. Feature selection can be performed effectively even when extracting a large amount of data for radiomics fingerprinting.","Random forest,Support vector machine,Multilayer perceptron,XGBoost,Machine learning,Meningioma,Grading,Feature selection",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"APPARENT,DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT,CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM,SURVIVAL,CANCER,IMAGES,TUMORS,BRAIN,KI-67,MRI",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,,

In general, permeability is measured in the laboratory based on subsurface core samples, calculated from well logs or estimated from well tests. However, laboratory measurements and well tests are expensive, time-consuming, and usually limited to a few core samples or wells in a hydrocarbon field or carbon storage site. Machine-learning techniques are good options for generating a rapid, robust, and cost-effective permeability prediction model because of their strengths to recognize the potential interrelationships between input and output variables. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), as a good pattern recognition algorithm, are widely used in image processing, natural language processing, and speech recognition, but are rarely used with regression problems and even less often in reservoir characterization. We have developed a CNN regression model to estimate the permeability in the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field, West Virginia, which is a potential carbon storage site and enhanced oil recovery operations field. We also evaluate the concept of the geologic feature image, which is converted from geophysical well logs. Five variables, including two commonly available conventional well logs (the gamma rays [GRs] and bulk density) and three well-log-derived variables (the slopes of the GR and bulk density curves, and shale content), are used to generate a geologic feature image. The CNN treats the geologic feature image as the input and the permeability as the desired output. In addition, the permeability predicted using traditional backpropagation artificial neural networks, which are optimized by genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, is compared with the permeability estimated using our CNN. Our results indicate that the CNN regression model provides more accurate permeability predictions than the traditional neural network.","RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION,CARBON SEQUESTRATION,POROSITY,PRESSURE,MODEL,ROCK,CLASSIFICATION,ARCHITECTURE,UNCERTAINTY,TRANSPORT",Article,"SOC EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICISTS, 8801 S YALE ST, TULSA, OK 74137 USA",Geochemistry & Geophysics,,3.281,"RESERVOIR,CHARACTERIZATION,CARBON,SEQUESTRATION,POROSITY,PRESSURE,MODEL,ROCK,CLASSIFICATION,ARCHITECTURE,UNCERTAINTY,TRANSPORT",GEOPHYSICS,,

Tools from machine learning, data mining, and neurocomputing have been extensively explored and utilized to accomplish such compelling data analytics tasks. However, for time-series data presenting active dynamic characteristics, many of the state-of-the-art techniques may not perform well in capturing the inherited temporal structures in these data. In this paper, integrating the Koopman operator and linear dynamical systems theory with support vector machines, we develop a novel dynamic data mining framework to construct low-dimensional linear models that approximate the nonlinear flow of high-dimensional time-series data generated by unknown nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework then immediately enables pattern recognition, e.g., classification, of complex time-series data to distinguish their dynamic behaviors by using the trajectories generated by the reduced linear systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of this framework through the problems of time-series classification in bioinformatics and healthcare, including cognitive classification and seizure detection with fMRI and EEG data, respectively. The developed Koopman dynamic learning framework then lays a solid foundation for effective dynamic data mining and promises a mathematically justified method for extracting the dynamics and significant temporal structures of nonlinear dynamical systems.","Koopman operators,Dynamic data mining,Data-driven methods,Dimensionality reduction,Spectral methods,Time-series classification,Healthcare,Bioinformatics",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,4.418,"VOXEL,PATTERN-ANALYSIS,SPECTRAL,PROPERTIES,EPILEPTIC,SEIZURES,FMRI,DATA,SYSTEMS,RECOGNITION,SELECTION,FRAMEWORK,ONSET",DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7390473,
7,A deep supervised approach for ischemic lesion segmentation from multimodal MRI using Fully Convolutional Network,84,,,"Karthik R.,Gupta Utkarsh,Jha Ashish,Rajalakshmi R.,Menaka R.","Karthik R,Gupta U,Jha A,Rajalakshmi R,Menaka R",Menaka R,10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105685,VIT Chennai,"The principle restorative step in the treatment of ischemic stroke depends on how fast the lesion is delineated from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. This will serve as a vital aid to estimate the extent of damage caused to the brain cells. However, manual delineation of the lesion is time-consuming and it is subjected to intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Most of the existing methods for ischemic lesion segmentation rely on extracting handcrafted features followed by application of a machine learning algorithm. Identifying such features demand multidomain expertise in Neuro-radiology as well as Image processing. This can be accomplished by learning the features automatically using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To perform segmentation, the spatial arrangement of pixel needs to be preserved in addition to learning local features of an image. Hence, a deep supervised Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is presented in this work to segment the ischemic lesion. The highlight of this research is the application of Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation in the last two layers of the network for a precise reconstruction of the ischemic lesion. By doi ng so, the network was able to learn additional features which are not considered in the existing U-Net architecture. Also, an extensive analysis was conducted in this research to select optimal hyperparameters for training the FCN. A mean segmentation accuracy of 0.70 has been achieved from the experiments conducted on ISLES 2015 dataset. Experimental observations show that our proposed FCN method is 10% better than the existing works in terms of Dice Coefficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Diagnosis of diseases from tissue samples is done manually by pathologists. Diagnostics process is usually time consuming and expensive. Hence, automated analysis of tissue samples from histopathology images has critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment. The computer aided systems can improve the quality of diagnoses and give pathologists a second opinion for critical cases. In this study, a deep learning based transfer learning approach has been proposed to classify histopathology images automatically.

10,Classification of tree species and stock volume estimation in ground forest images using Deep Learning,166,,,"Liu Jiazheng,Wang Xuefeng,Wang Tian","Liu JZ,Wang XF,Wang T",Wang XF,10.1016/j.compag.2019.105012,Chinese Academy of Forestry,"Tree species classification and estimation of stock volume are two very important tasks in forest management. Currently, Ground Surveys' Development (GSD) is the basic and most common approach employed by foresters. However, GSD is time-consuming and inefficient as it requires great human effort. In this research, digital cameras have been used, to obtain images of the ground forest. The classification and accumulation of tree species is performed, by considering extracted relevant image information. The purpose of this effort is not only to improve research efficiency, but to reduce the consumption of human and material resources as well. This research uses the UNET network which is pre-trained by the VGG16 model. The aim is to semantically segment the image containing the ground forest and the species and then to accurately identify the number of trees contained in the image. The proportion of the number of pixels in the trunk of each segment is estimated by considering the total number of pixels in the image. The nonlinear mixed effect model is used to estimate the growing stock volume. The differences in the growing stock volume caused by different forest types, are resolved by using the growing stock volume estimation equations, related to different tree species. The experimental results show that the tree species' classification accuracy in testing is 96.03% and the average IoU (Intersection over Union) is 86%. The R-2 and RMSE of the growing stock volume prediction model are equal to 80.70% and 30.539 (m(3)/ha) respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the method proposed in this research can be used as an effective tool for tree species' image segmentation and classification, and that the growing stock volume is predicted accurately by the extracted tree pixel information. The combination of the two approaches provides a new method for forestry ground investigation work.","Ground forest image,Deep Learning,UNET,Tree species classification,Nonlinear mixed effect model,Growing stock volume",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Agriculture,Computer Science",,5.494,"LIDAR,DATA,BIOMASS,GROWTH,STANDS",COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,,

12,Automatic detection of pipe-flange reflections in GPR data sections using supervised learning,170,,,"Bordon Pablo,Bonomo Nestor,Martinelli Patricia","Bordon P,Bonomo N,Martinelli P",Bonomo N,10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.103856,University of Buenos Aires,"Ground Penetrating radar (GPR) is a method widely used to study the near-surface subsoil. Many GPR applications require the acquisition of large volumes of data. In these cases, the processing and analysis of the data involve considerable amounts of time and human effort, and the possibility of errors increases. Considering this, the implementation of dependable methods for the automatic detection of GPR response-patterns of the targeted structures becomes clear, because they can contribute to the efficiency and reliability of the interpretation.
In this work, we present three methods for automatic detection of pipe-flange signals in constant-offset reflection-GPR images. These methods were obtained using well-known supervised machine learning techniques, and data acquired during a previous study of an extensive section of a pipeline. The first two methods are based on support vector machines (SVM), combined with the image descriptors local binary patterns (IBP) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the third, on artificial neural networks (ANN). The training and validation of these types of algorithms require large numbers of positive and negative samples. From the mentioned study, we had only 16 experimental flange-patterns. Then, in this work, they were taken as references, together with available documentation on the geometry and materials of the pipe and flanges, for building a broad database of synthetic patterns corresponding to different depths of the pipe and characteristics of the environment. These patterns constitute the set of positive samples used for training and validation. They were also used for the final test of the algorithms. The negative samples for the three stages were directly extracted from the profiles.
The results obtained indicate the usefulness of the proposed methodologies to identify the flanges. The best performance corresponded to the ANN, closely followed by SVM combined with HOG, and finally SVM with LBP. In particular, the ANN provided rates of false positive (FP) predictions for the validation and test samples of about 3%, and rates of false negative (FN) predictions of 1.67% for the validation samples and 18.75% for the test samples. Greater FN rates for the test experimental samples, in comparison to those obtained for the validation synthetic samples, were also observed for both SVM algorithms. The detection failures mainly originated in that some complex features of the experimental flange responses could not be appropriately reproduced through the performed numerical simulations, and therefore, some of the patterns were not satisfactorily represented in the sets of positive samples used for training and validation. A first option to improve the results is to obtain a significant number and variety of experimental samples of flange responses and use them to train and validate the algorithms. Other alternatives are to use more sophisticated numerical simulation environments and to find more efficient attributes of the data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A full color TFT LCD display was used as the uniform source of any color of light. Aptamer conjugated gold nanoparticles were employed to determine the concentration of Hg2+ as the basis of a colorimetric sensor. Interaction between the aptamer and the analytes leads to a color change in the solution due to aggregation of gold nanoparticles. For the corresponding color change detection, a novel image processing protocol using RGB value was introduced for each captured image. Multiple linear regression analysis was also exploited to achieve a better sensor response model. Light source enhancement, colorimetry at more points of visible spectrum (470, 540, 640 nm) and a powerful post process technique including machine learning made it possible to obtain an excellent level of sensitivity (1 nM-0.2 ppb).","Gold nanoparticles,Localized surface plasmon resonance,Lab-on-a-phone,colorimetry,RGB value,Multiple linear regression,Mercury concentration",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Electrochemistry,Instruments & Instrumentation",,6.743,"GOLD,NANOPARTICLES,OPTICAL-PROPERTIES,RATIONAL,DESIGN,SENSOR,PROTEIN,IONS,LEAD,SIZE",SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL,,

An increasingly number of publications follow the concept of embedding the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction as a known operator into a neural network. However, most of the approaches presented lack an efficient CT reconstruction framework fully integrated into deep learning environments. As a result, many approaches use workarounds for mathematically unambiguously solvable problems. Methods PYRO-NN is a generalized framework to embed known operators into the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow. The current status includes state-of-the-art parallel-, fan-, and cone-beam projectors, and back-projectors accelerated with CUDA provided as Tensorflow layers. On top, the framework provides a high-level Python API to conduct FBP and iterative reconstruction experiments with data from real CT systems. Results The framework provides all necessary algorithms and tools to design end-to-end neural network pipelines with integrated CT reconstruction algorithms. The high-level Python API allows a simple use of the layers as known from Tensorflow. All algorithms and tools are referenced to a scientific publication and are compared to existing non-deep learning reconstruction frameworks. To demonstrate the capabilities of the layers, the framework comes with baseline experiments, which are described in the supplementary material. The framework is available as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 licence at . Conclusions PYRO-NN comes with the prevalent deep learning framework Tensorflow and allows to setup end-to-end trainable neural networks in the medical image reconstruction context. We believe that the framework will be a step toward reproducible research and give the medical physics community a toolkit to elevate medical image reconstruction with new deep learning techniques.","inverse problems,known operator learning,machine learning,open source,reconstruction",Article; Early Access,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION,DEEP,FRAMEWORK,DOMAIN",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.13753,

However, two main drawbacks of iterative optimization-based CSMRI methods are time-consuming and are limited in model capacity. Meanwhile, one main challenge for recent deep learning-based CSMRI is the trade-off between model performance and network size. To address the above issues, we develop a new multi-scale dilated network for MRI reconstruction with high speed and outstanding performance. Comparing to convolutional kernels with same receptive fields, dilated convolutions reduce network parameters with smaller kernels and expand receptive fields of kernels to obtain almost same information. To maintain the abundance of features, we present global and local residual learnings to extract more image edges and details. Then we utilize concatenation layers to fuse multi-scale features and residual learnings for better reconstruction. Compared with several non-deep and deep learning CSMRI algorithms, the proposed method yields better reconstruction accuracy and noticeable visual improvements. In addition, we perform the noisy setting to verify the model stability, and then extend the proposed model on a MRI super-resolution task.","MRI reconstruction,Dilated convolution,Residual learning,Multi-scale",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"IMAGE,RECONSTRUCTION",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05251,

The considered system uncertainties including the constituent material properties, the dimensions of structural members, and the degree of the gradation of the FGM are incorporated. A novel kernel-based machine learning technique, namely the extended support vector regression (X-SVR), is presented to estimate the governing relationship between the uncertain system parameters and the structural natural frequencies. Subsequently, by applying the Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) through the established regression model, various types of statistical characteristics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, probability density function or PDF, and cumulative distribution function or CDF) of structural natural frequencies can be effectively established. Four numerical examples including test functions and practically stimulated engineering structures are thoroughly investigated herein to demonstrate the accuracy, applicability, and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.","Stochastic free vibration analysis,Machine learning,Uncertainty analysis",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mechanics",,4.629,"NONLINEAR,FREE-VIBRATION,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS,FINITE-ELEMENT,FGM,PLATE,SYSTEM,RANDOMNESS,STATIC,ANALYSIS,KERNEL,CLASSIFICATION,RELIABILITY",THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES,,

Since generating an effective lesion representation is a vital step to ensure the success of lesion classification, the discriminative power of different types of features is exploited. Specifically, we combine clinically important asymmetry, border irregularity, colour and dermoscopic structure features with texture features extracted using Grey Level Run Length Matrix, Local Binary Patterns, and Histogram of Oriented Gradients operators for lesion representation. Then, we propose two enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) models for feature optimization. The first model employs adaptive acceleration coefficients, multiple remote leaders, in-depth sub-dimension feature search and re-initialization mechanisms to overcome stagnation. The second model uses random acceleration coefficients, instead of adaptive ones, based on non-linear circle, sine and helix functions, respectively, to increase diversification and intensification. Ensemble classifiers are also constructed with each base model trained using each optimized feature subset. A deep convolutional neural network is devised whose hyper-parameters are fine-tuned using the proposed PSO models. Extensive experimental studies using dermoscopic skin lesion data, medical data from the UCI machine learning repository, and ALL-IDB2 image data are conducted to evaluate the model efficiency systematically. The results from empirical evaluations and statistical tests indicate the superiority of the proposed models over other advanced PSO variants and classical search methods pertaining to discriminative feature selection and optimal hyper-parameter identification for deep learning networks in lesion classification as well as other disease diagnosis.

The previous studies used traditional CNN with bounding boxes to localize the defects, which is unable to locate defect boundaries effectively, and it is difficult to quantify defects. In order to overcome these obstacles, an instance-level recognition and quantification approach based on Mask R-CNN is proposed in this paper. A total of 428 raw images (with a resolution of 3024 x 3024 pixels) are cropped into 256 x 256 pixel images, and 2198 images containing bugholes are selected to create the datasets. Then, the architecture of the Mask R-CNN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this datasets. Results show 90.0%, 90.8% average precision (AP) for the bounding box and mask, respectively. The accuracy of bounding box and mask are 92.2% and 92.6%, respectively. The quantification performance is evaluated by the measured value of seventy bugholes, results show that more than 68% of bugholes have an area error rate of less than 10%, more than 74% of bugholes have a maximum diameter error rate of less than 10%.

Methods: With a combination of data cycle-consistent adversarial network, endto- end convolutional neural network mapping, and data fidelity enforcement for reconstructing undersampled MR data, SANTIS additionally utilizes a samplingaugmented training strategy by extensively varying undersampling patterns during training, so that the network is capable of learning various aliasing structures and thereby removing undersampling artifacts more effectively and robustly. The performance of SANTIS was demonstrated for accelerated knee imaging and liver imaging using a Cartesian trajectory and a golden-angle radial trajectory, respectively. Quantitative metrics were used to assess its performance against different references. The feasibility of SANTIS in reconstructing dynamic contrast-enhanced images was also demonstrated using transfer learning.
Results: Compared to conventional reconstruction that exploits image sparsity, SANTIS achieved consistently improved reconstruction performance (lower errors and greater image sharpness). Compared to standard learning-based methods without sampling augmentation (e. g., training with a fixed undersampling pattern), SANTIS provides comparable reconstruction performance, but significantly improved robustness, against sampling pattern discrepancy. SANTIS also achieved encouraging results for reconstructing liver images acquired at different contrast phases.
Conclusion: By extensively varying undersampling patterns, the sampling-augmented training strategy in SANTIS can remove undersampling artifacts more robustly. The novel concept behind SANTIS can particularly be useful for improving the robustness of deep learning-based image reconstruction against discrepancy between training and inference, an important, but currently less explored, topic.","data augmentation,data cycle-consistent adversarial network,deep learning,image reconstruction,reconstruction robustness,sampling discrepancy",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"DEEP,CLASSIFICATION,COMBINATION",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6660404,

Numerous methods have been proposed to fulfill this challenging task, including feature methods and machine learning methods. Recently, with the development of deep learning techniques, many studies achieved better results than traditional feature methods, and the combination of traditional methods and deep learning techniques gradually received attention. In this paper, we propose a recurrence network-based convolutional neural network (RN-CNN) method to detect fatigue driving. To be specific, we first conduct a simulated driving experiment to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of subjects under alert state and fatigue state. Then, we construct the multiplex recurrence network (RN) from EEG signals to fuse information from the original time series. Finally, CNN is employed to extract and learn the features of a multiplex RN for realizing a classification task. The results indicate that the proposed RN-CNN method can achieve an average accuracy of 92.95%. To verify the effectiveness of our method, some existing competitive methods are compared with ours.

Allocating water absorption of each sublayer by dividing coefficient or numeric simulation cannot accurately reflect the actual water injection of the reservoir. Calculation based on water absorption profile monitored on site is the most commonly used method in oil field. However, access to these type of data is limited due to its cost and time related to acquisition. In this study, a machine learning approach was adopted to predict water absorption in sublayer based on geologic and production parameters of injectors and producers. On the one hand, it can save test costs. On the other hand, it can continuously predict water absorption of sublayers, and make up for water injection wells with insufficient injection profiles. A handful of training observations are obtained from on-site monitoring. Interwell connectivity is first conducted to identify connected producers for injectors. Introducing interwell connectivity helps to constitute predictor variables and yield significant improvements in feature selection. Connectivities in the well group are represented by similarity between injection sequence and production sequence, which is computed by Dynamic Time Warping. Average importance of predictors are then measured based on Mean Decrease Impurity, Mean Decrease Accuracy, and Ridge regression. Some relative important features are selected to consist the final predictors. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model is developed and then trained for making predictions given any set of observations.

Materials and methods: We evaluated the accuracy of detection of documentation of decline of insulin therapy by patients using sentence-level naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM)-based classification (with and without SMOTE oversampling), token-level sequence labelling using conditional random fields (CRFs), uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) models with GRU and LSTM cells, and rule-based detection using Canary platform. All models were trained using the same manually annotated 50,046-document training set and evaluated on the same 1501-document held-out set. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using 10-fold cross-validation.
Results: At the sentence level, prevalence of documentation of decline of insulin therapy by patients was 0.02% in both training and held-out sets.

The ideal solution to this concern is to prevent in advance by controlling related metabolic factors. However, it is difficult for medical staff to decide whether special precautions are needed for a potential patient only based on the monitoring of physiological indicators unless they are obviously abnormal. This paper will develop a hybrid machine learning approach to predict cerebral stroke for clinical diagnosis based on the physiological data with incompleteness and class imbalance.
Methods: Two steps are involved in the whole process. Firstly, random forest regression is adopted to impute missing values before classification. Secondly, an automated hyperparameter optimization(AutoHPO) based on deep neural network(DNN) is applied to stroke prediction on an imbalanced dataset.
Results: The medical dataset contains 43,400 records of potential patients which includes 783 occurrences of stroke. The false negative rate from our prediction approach is only 19.1%, which has reduced by an average of 51.5% in comparison to other traditional approaches. The false positive rate, accuracy and sensitivity predicted by the proposed approach are respectively 33.1, 71.6, and 67.4%.
Conclusion: The approach proposed in this paper has effectively reduced the false negative rate with a relatively high overall accuracy, which means a successful decrease in the misdiagnosis rate for stroke prediction. The results are more reliable and valid as the reference in stroke prognosis, and also can be acquired conveniently at a low cost.","Stroke prediction,Clinical decision,Class imbalance,AutoHPO",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Medical Informatics",,5.602,CLASSIFICATION,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,

ToF-SIMS analysis is extremely useful for interrogating the surfaces of complex materials and shows great promise in analyzing biological samples. Previously, the authors demonstrated that segmentation (between 1 and 0.005 m/z mass bins) of the mass spectral axis can be used to differentiate between polymeric materials with both very similar and dissimilar molecular compositions. Here, the same approach is applied for the analysis of proteins on surfaces, focusing on the effect of binding and orientation of an antibody on the resulting ToF-SIMS spectrum. Due to the complex nature of the samples that contain combinations of only 20 amino acids differing in sequence, it is enormously challenging and prohibitively time-consuming to distinguish the minute variances presented in each dataset through manual analysis alone. Herein, the authors describe how to apply the newly developed rapid data analysis workflow to previously published ToF-SIMS data for complex biological materials, immobilized antibodies. This automated method reduced the analysis time by two orders of magnitudes while enhancing data quality and allows the removal of any user bias. The authors used mass segmentation at 0.005 m/z over a 1-300 mass range to generate 60 000 variables. In contrast to the previous manual binning approach, this method captures the entire mass range of the spectrum resulting in an information-rich dataset rather than specifically selected mass spectral peaks. This work constitutes an additional proof of concept that rapid and automated data analyses involving mass-segmented ToF-SIMS spectra can efficiently and robustly analyze a broader range of complex materials, ranging from generic polymers to complicated biological samples. This automated analysis method is also ideally positioned to provide data to train machine learning models of surface-property relationships that can greatly enhance the understanding of how the surface interacts with biology and provides more accurate and robust quantitative predictions of the biological properties of new materials.","PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,ORIENTATION",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Biophysics,Materials Science",,2.827,"PRINCIPAL,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,ORIENTATION",BIOINTERPHASES,,

Instead of explicit modeling and simulation of the surface microstructure (which was explored in previous work), we propose a novel direction: learning the high-frequency directional patterns from synthetic or measured examples, by training a generative adversarial network (GAN). A key challenge in applying GAN synthesis to spatially varying BRDFs is evaluating the reflectance for a single location and direction without the cost of evaluating the whole hemisphere. We resolve this using a novel method for partial evaluation of the generator network. We are also able to control large-scale spatial texture using a conditional GAN approach.

Established workflows are either time and labor consuming (i.e., manual editing on dense frames with controllers), or lack keyframe-level control (i.e., physically-based simulation). Not surprisingly, garment authoring remains a bottleneck in many production pipelines. Instead, we present a deep-learning-based approach for semi-automatic authoring of garment animation, wherein the user provides the desired garment shape in a selection of keyframes, while our system infers a latent representation for its motion-independent intrinsic parameters (e.g., gravity, cloth materials, etc.). Given new character motions, the latent representation allows to automatically generate a plausible garment animation at interactive rates. Having factored out character motion, the learned intrinsic garment space enables smooth transition between keyframes on a new motion sequence. Technically, we learn an intrinsic garment space with an motion-driven autoencoder network, where the encoder maps the garment shapes to the intrinsic space under the condition of body motions, while the decoder acts as a differentiable simulator to generate garment shapes according to changes in character body motion and intrinsic parameters. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on common garment types. Experiments demonstrate our system can significantly improve current garment authoring workflows via an interactive user interface. Compared with the standard CG pipeline, our system significantly reduces the ratio of required keyframes from 20% to 1 - 2%.","intrinsic garment space,latent representation,interactive garment animation authoring",Article,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",Computer Science,,6.445,,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10092084/1/paper_Tuanfeng_GarmentAnimation_author.pdf,

A fundamental step in the pre-processing and analysis of MRI scans is the identification of the mid-sagittal plane, which corresponds to the mid-brain and allows a coordinate reference system for the whole MRI scan set. Approach: To improve the identification of the mid-sagittal plane we have developed an algorithm in Matlab (R) based on the k-means clustering function. The results have been compared with the evaluation of four experts who manually identified the mid-sagittal plane and whose performances have been combined with a cognitive decisional algorithm in order to define a gold standard. Main results: The comparison provided a mean percentage error of 1.84%. To further refine the automatic procedure we trained a machine learning system using the results from the proposed algorithm and the gold standard. We tested this machine learning system and obtained results comparable to medical raters with a mean absolute error of 1.86 slices.

Accordingly, there has been ongoing research about learning maps with the goal of developing a comprehensive, easy to use, and powerful learning map. At present, the two most frequently used maps have either an ontological basis or take their design from the Petri net. These both provide a useful learning tool for learners. The ontology-based learning map represents integral concepts of knowledge and the relationships among concepts; however, it lacks the ability to control the learners' progress. The Petri net-based map can handle and personalize learning progress and designing the map is relatively easy, but its representation of the subject matter is relatively weak. The aim of this study is to design useful learning sequences and a representation interface that combine the above strengths. To do this, it offers the Dynamic Learning Paths Framework (DLPF), which is based on schema theory and the concept of collective intelligence. With the DLPF system, learners can provide feedback and contribute to a specific learning schema by submitting extra learning material. The self-improvement mechanism in the DLPF is designed to maintain the quality of learning materials to avoid the bias of collective intelligence. To evaluate the DLPF, questionnaires were developed and experiments to ascertain learning performance experiment were conducted. The results show that the proposed framework provides the well-organized learning materials, presents subject material effectively and can contribute to an improvement in learners' academic performance.","Learning paths,Collective intelligence,Learning performance,Learning materials",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Psychology,,,"SCIENCE,SYSTEM,MAP",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,,

Traditional work has focused on mass-univariate statistical approaches that identify important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with quantitative traits (QTs) of brain structure or function. More recently, to address the problemof multiple comparison and weak detection, multivariate analysis methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) are often used to select themost relevant SNPs associated with QTs. However, one problemof Lasso, aswell as many other feature selection methods for imaging genetics, is that some useful prior information, e.g., the hierarchical structure among SNPs, are rarely used for designing a more powerful model. In this paper, we propose to identify the associations between candidate genetic features (i.e., SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures using a tree-guided sparse learning (TGSL) method. The advantage of our method is that it explicitly models the complex hierarchical structure among the SNPs in the objective function for feature selection. Specifically, motivated by the biological knowledge, the hierarchical structures involving gene groups and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks aswell as individual SNPs are imposed as a tree-guided regularization termin our TGSLmodel. Experimental studies on simulation data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data show that our method not only achieves better predictions than competing methods on the MRI-derived measures of AD-related region of interests (ROIs) (i.e., hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus), but also identifies sparse SNP patterns at the block level to better guide the biological interpretation.","Imaging genetics,tree-guided sparse learning,SNPs,hierarchical structure,ROIs",Article,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Computer Science,Mathematics",,3.395,"ONSET,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,WHOLE-GENOME,ASSOCIATION,QUANTITATIVE,TRAIT,LOCI,IMAGING,PHENOTYPES,REGRESSION,SELECTION,PREDICTION,SHRINKAGE,GENOTYPE,ATROPHY",IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2018.2833487,

Changes to the intestinal microbiome, the community of micro-organisms that resides in the human gut, have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. IBD diagnosis is often delayed due to its non-specific symptoms and because an invasive colonoscopy is required for confirmation, which leads to poor growth in children and worse treatment outcomes. Feature selection algorithms are often applied to microbial communities to identify bacterial groups that drive disease. It has been shown that aggregating Ensemble Feature Selection (EFS) can improve the robustness of feature selection algorithms, which is defined as the variation of feature selector output caused by small changes to the dataset. In this work, we apply a two-step filter and an EFS process to generate robust feature subsets that can non-invasively predict IBD subtypes from high-resolution microbiome data. The predictive power of the robust feature subsets is the highest reported in literature to date.

For example, due to computational cost, obtaining the oxygen ion conductivity (label) of compounds often requires a few days or weeks of calculations by molecular dynamics simulation, whereas unlabeled samples, such as the electronic states (features) of compounds, are relatively easily obtained (in one or two days). To address this issue, we develop a neural network model in transductive inference on regression, in which both the label smoothness and locally estimated label penalties are incorporated into the objective function. In addition, we propose empirical excess risk bounds for the neural network model in transductive inference on regression. These bounds using local Rademacher complexity are based on the eigenvalue analysis of the empirical Gram matrix. Experimental results were obtained on five benchmark data sets of regression problems and the data screening task of the oxygen ion conductivity as a real application. The proposed model was compared favorably with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the proposed method improved the generalization performance of a linear regression model on data screening task. Finally, the results of the empirical excess risk bounds implied that these bounds are useful tools with respect to choosing the values of the hyperparameters of the model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial context information may be highly beneficial for segmentation performance improvement. To this end, this paper proposes an iterative multi-path fully convolutional network (IMFCN) to effectively leverage spatial context for automatic cardiac segmentation in cine MR images. Methods To effectively leverage spatial context information, the proposed IMFCN explicitly models the interslice spatial correlations using a multi-path late fusion strategy. First, the contextual inputs including both the adjacent slices and the already predicted mask of the above adjacent slice are processed by independent feature-extraction paths. Then, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module is employed at the feature fusion process to combine the extracted high-level contextual features in a more effective way. Finally, deep supervision (DS) and batch-wise class re-weighting mechanism are utilized to enhance the training of the proposed network. Results The proposed IMFCN was evaluated and analyzed on the MICCAI 2017 automatic cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC) dataset. On the held-out training dataset reserved for testing, our method effectively improved its counterparts that without spatial context and that with spatial context but using an early fusion strategy. On the 50 subjects test dataset, our method achieved Dice similarity coefficient of 0.935, 0.920, and 0.905, and Hausdorff distance of 7.66, 12.10, and 8.80 mm for LV, RV, and MYO, respectively, which are comparable or even better than the state-of-the-art methods of ACDC Challenge. In addition, to explore the applicability to other datasets, the proposed IMFCN was retrained on the Sunnybrook dataset for LV segmentation and also produced comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

Artificial neural network (ANN) was adapted as the modelling tool for this study and was developed with a two-layer feed-forward network, hidden neurons with sigmoid activation function and linear output neurons for the simulation of the network. The setting time and concrete compressive strength at varying curing days were predicted using the neural network model with variations of constituents of the cement content consisting of OPC, SDA and AW as the input of the network. Three input and seven output data set were used for the model development using the following algorithms; Data Division: Random, Training: Levenberg-Marquardt and Calculation: MATLAB. The data sets are set aside for validation, training and testing; 70% of the samples are used for training, 15% for validation and 15% are also used for testing. The performance of the networks was evaluated using linear regression, RMSE and R-values. The model performance scored 0.91 and 0.07 for R-2 and RMSE, respectively, and performed better than the linear regression model, the results indicate the efficiency, reliability and usefulness of ANN for predicting concrete mechanical properties where AW and SDA are used to replace cement ratio accurately.","Alkali-silica reaction,Setting time,Compressive strength,Artificial neural network,MATLAB,Pozzolan",Article,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,SILICA,FUME,FLY-ASH,PREDICTION",SN APPLIED SCIENCES,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-019-1504-2.pdf,

However, price fluctuations, environmental concerns, technological development, emerging unconventional resources, energy security challenges, and shipment are some of the forces made the NG market more dynamic and complex. From a policy-making perspective, it is vital to uncover demand-side future trends. This paper proposed an intelligent forecasting model to forecast NG global demand, however investigating a multi-dimensional purified input vector. The model starts with a data mining (DM) step to purify input features, identify the best time lags, and pre-processing selected input vector. Then a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) which is equipped with genetic optimizer is applied to set up ANN's characteristics. Among 13 available input features, six features (e.g., Alternative and Nuclear Energy, CO2 Emissions, GDP per Capita, Urban Population, Natural Gas Production, Oil Consumption) were selected as the most relevant feature via the DM step. Then, the hybrid learning prediction model is designed to extrapolate the consumption of future trends. The proposed model overcomes competitive models refer to different five error based evaluation statistics consist of R-2, MAE, MAPE, MBE, and RMSE. In addition, as the model proposed the best input feature set, results compared to the model which used the raw input set, with no DM purification process. The comparison showed that DmGNn overcame dramatically a simple GNn. Also, a looser prediction model, such as a generalized neural network with purified input features obtained a larger R-2 indicator (=0.9864) than the GNn (=0.9679).","natural gas demands,prediction,energy market,genetic algorithm,artificial neural network,data mining",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Energy & Fuels,,,"ABSOLUTE,ERROR,MAE,SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND,NEURAL-NETWORK,GENETIC,ALGORITHM,TIME-SERIES,SHORT-TERM,CONSUMPTION,PREDICTION,DECISION,FRAMEWORK,FORECASTING-MODEL,RENEWABLE,ENERGY",ENERGIES,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/21/4124/pdf,

Here, we hypothesize that (1) QCT imaging features of shape, density and structure derived from data-driven image analysis techniques can improve the hip fracture discrimination of classification models based on mean femoral neck aBMD (Neck.aBMD), and (2) that data-driven cortical bone thickness (Ct.Th) features can improve the hip fracture discrimination of vBMD models. We tested our hypotheses using statistical multi-parametric modeling (SMPM) in a QCT study of acute hip fracture of 50 controls and 93 fragility fracture cases. SMPM was used to extract features of shape, vBMD, Ct.Th, cortical vBMD, and vBMD in a layer adjacent to the endosteal surface to develop hip fracture classification models with machine learning logistic LASSO. The performance of these classification models was evaluated in two aspects: (1) their hip fracture classification capability without Neck.aBMD, and (2) their capability to improve the hip fracture classification of the Neck.aBMD model. Assessments were done with 10-fold cross-validation, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), differences of AUCs, and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. All LASSO models including SMPM-vBMD features, and the majority of models including SMPM-Ct.Th features performed significantly better than the Neck.aBMD model; and all SMPM features significantly improved the hip fracture discrimination of the Neck.aBMD model (Hypothesis 1). An interesting finding was that SMPM-features of vBMD also captured Ct.Th patterns, potentially explaining the superior classification performance of models based on SMPM-vBMD features (Hypothesis 2). Age, height and weight had a small impact on model performances, and the model of shape, vBMD and Ct.Th consistently yielded better performances than the Neck.aBMD models. Results of this study clearly support the relevance of bone density and quality on the assessment of hip fracture, and demonstrate their potential on patient and healthcare cost benefits.","Quantitative computed tomography (QCT),Hip,Fracture,Statistical multi-parametric modeling (SMPM),Bone mineral density (BMD),Cortical bone thickness (Ct,Th)",Article,"SPRINGER, 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Engineering,,,"BONE-MINERAL,DENSITY,PROXIMAL,FEMUR,OSTEOPOROTIC,FRACTURES,POSTMENOPAUSAL,WOMEN,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,PARATHYROID-HORMONE,CORTICAL,BONE,RISK-ASSESSMENT,UNITED-STATES,PREDICTION",ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012369,

Flemming,Hansen DF,Hansen DF,10.1007/s10858-019-00265-1,University of London,"Non-uniform and sparse sampling of multi-dimensional NMR spectra has over the last decade become an important tool to allow for fast acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spectra with high resolution. The success of non-uniform sampling NMR hinge on both the development of algorithms to accurately reconstruct the sparsely sampled spectra and the design of sampling schedules that maximise the information contained in the sampled data. Traditionally, the reconstruction tools and algorithms have aimed at reconstructing the full spectrum and thus 'fill out the missing points' in the time-domain spectrum, although other techniques are based on multi-dimensional decomposition and extraction of multi-dimensional shapes. Also over the last decade, machine learning, deep neural networks, and artificial intelligence have seen new applications in an enormous range of sciences, including analysis of MRI spectra. As a proof-of-principle, it is shown here that simple deep neural networks can be trained to reconstruct sparsely sampled NMR spectra. For the reconstruction of two-dimensional NMR spectra, reconstruction using a deep neural network performs as well, if not better than, the currently and widely used techniques. It is therefore anticipated that deep neural networks provide a very valuable tool for the reconstruction of sparsely sampled NMR spectra in the future to come.","Deep neural networks,NMR,Non-uniform sampling,Sparse sampling,Spectral reconstruction",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Spectroscopy",,2.721,"APSY-NMR,SPECTROSCOPY,RESOLUTION,ASSIGNMENT,HMQC",JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR NMR,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10078403/1/Hansen2019_Article_UsingDeepNeuralNetworksToRecon.pdf,

In the training stage, we employ six different enhancement algorithms to obtain multiple complementary features that contain rich vascular information. Then, the manually annotated ground-truth vessels are classified into thick or thin vessels as the label information, and the label consistent KSVD based framework is applied to train the dictionary for vessel segmentation. In the testing stage, comprehensive experiments are conducted on three datasets to measure segmentation performance with eight representative evaluation metrics.

In this article, the authors conducted a user experiment to study the user emotion experience of virtual reality (VR) by comparing subjective feelings and physiological data in VR and two-dimensional display (2D) environments. First, they analyzed the data of self-report questionnaires, including Self-assessment Manikin (SAM), Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The result indicated that VR causes a higher level of arousal than 2D, and easily evokes positive emotions. Both 2D and VR environments are prone to eye fatigue, but VR is more likely to cause symptoms of dizziness and vertigo. Second, they compared the differences of electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature (SKT) and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals in two circumstances. Through mathematical analysis, all three signals had significant differences. Participants in the VR environment had a higher degree of excitement, and the mood fluctuations are more frequent and more intense. In addition, the authors used different machine learning models for emotion detection, and compared the accuracies on VR and 2D datasets. The accuracies of all algorithms in the VR environment are higher than that of 2D, which corroborated that the volunteers in the VR environment have more obvious skin electrical signals, and had a stronger sense of immersion. This article effectively compensated for the inadequacies of existing work.

For instance, design repositories can be used to train deep learning algorithms to assess component manufacturability; however, methods to determine the suitability of a design repository for use with machine learning do not exist. We provide an initial investigation toward identifying such a method using ""artificial"" design repositories to experimentally test the extent to which altering properties of the dataset impacts the assessment precision and generalizability of neural networks trained on the data. For this experiment, we use a 3D convolutional neural network to estimate quantitative manufacturing metrics directly from voxel-based component geometries. Additive manufacturing (AM) is used as a case study because of the recent growth of AM-focused design repositories such as GrabCAD and Thingiverse that are readily accessible online. In this study, we focus only on material extrusion, the dominant consumer AM process, and investigate three AM build metrics: (1) part mass, (2) support material mass, and (3) build time. Additionally, we compare the convolutional neural network accuracy to that of a baseline multiple linear regression model. Our results suggest that training on design repositories with less standardized orientation and position resulted in more accurate trained neural networks and that orientation-dependent metrics were harder to estimate than orientation-independent metrics. Furthermore, the convolutional neural network was more accurate than the baseline linear regression model for all build metrics.","design automation,design evaluation,design for manufacturing",Article,"ASME, TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",Engineering,,3.602,"BUILD-TIME,ESTIMATION,PREDICTION,OPTIMIZATION,ORIENTATION,PARAMETERS,POROSITY,SUPPORT,MODEL",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,,

Accurate epicardial adipose tissue quantification is still an open research issue. Considering that manual approaches are generally user-dependent and time-consuming, computer-assisted tools can considerably improve the result repeatability as well as reduce the time required for performing an accurate segmentation. Unfortunately, fully automatic strategies might not always identify the Region of Interest (ROI) correctly. Moreover, they could require user interaction for handling unexpected events.
This paper proposes a semi-automatic method for Epicardial Fat Volume (EFV) segmentation and quantification. Unlike supervised Machine Learning approaches, the method does not require any initial training or modeling phase to set up the system. As a further key novelty, the method also yields a subdivision into quartiles of the adipose tissue density. Quartile-based analysis conveys information about fat densities distribution, enabling an in-depth study towards a possible correlation between fat amounts, fat distribution, and heart diseases.
Experimental tests were performed on 50 Calcium Score (CaSc) series and 95 Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CorCTA) series. Area-based and distance-based metrics were used to evaluate the segmentation accuracy, by obtaining Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 93.74% and Mean Absolute Distance (MAD) = 2.18 for CaSc, as well as DSC = 92.48% and MAD = 2.87 for CorCTA. Moreover, the Pearson and Spearman coefficients were computed for quantifying the correlation between the ground-truth EFV and the corresponding automated measurement, by obtaining 0.9591 and 0.9490 for CaSc, and 0.9513 and 0.9319 for CorCTA, respectively.
In conclusion, the proposed EFV quantification and analysis method represents a clinically useable tool assisting the cardiologist to gain insights into a specific clinical scenario and leading towards personalized diagnosis and therapy.","Epicardial fat volume,Cardiac adipose tissue quantification,Semi-automatic segmentation,Calcium score scans,Coronary computed tomography angiography scans,Fat density quartiles",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"PERICARDIAL,FAT,ABDOMINAL,FAT,RISK-FACTORS,ASSOCIATION,TOMOGRAPHY,MRI",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/310434/3/EFV_Segmentation_Final.pdf,

In a previous work, we introduced a method which accurately detected NCSz in EEG data (referred here as 'Batch method'). However, this approach was less effective when the EEG features identified at the beginning of the recording changed over time. Such pattern drift is an issue that causes failures of automated seizure detection methods. This paper presents a support vector machine (SVM)-based incremental learning method for NCSz detection that for the first time addresses the seizure evolution in EEG records from patients with epileptic disorders and from ICU having NCSz. To implement the incremental learning SVM, three methodologies are tested. These approaches differ in the way they reduce the set of potentially available support vectors that are used to build the decision function of the classifier. To evaluate the suitability of the three incremental learning approaches proposed here for NCSz detection, first, a comparative study between the three methods is performed. Secondly, the incremental learning approach with the best performance is compared with the Batch method and three other batch methods from the literature.

The atrial wall thickness (AWT) can potentially improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying atrial structure that drives AF and provides important clinical information. However, most existing studies for estimating AWT rely on ruler-based measurements performed on only a few selected locations in 2D or 3D using digital calipers. Only a few studies have developed automatic approaches to estimate the AWT in the left atrium, and there are currently no methods to robustly estimate the AWT of both atrial chambers. Therefore, we have developed a computational pipeline to automatically calculate the 3D AWT across bi-atrial chambers and extensively validated our pipeline on both ex vivo and in vivo human atria data. The atrial geometry was first obtained by segmenting the atrial wall from the MRIs using a novel machine learning approach. The epicardial and endocardial surfaces were then separated using a multi-planar convex hull approach to define boundary conditions, from which, a Laplace equation was solved numerically to automatically separate bi-atrial chambers. To robustly estimate the AWT in each atrial chamber, coupled partial differential equations by coupling the Laplace solution with two surface trajectory functions were formulated and solved.

The motivation for this contribution originates from the currently intensively investigated topic Predictive Maintenance (PdM), which refers to a proactive way of triggering servicing actions for industrial machinery. The aim of this maintenance strategy is to identify wear and tear, and consequent malfunctioning by analyzing condition monitoring data, recorded by sensor equipped machinery, in real-time. Recent developments in this area have shown potential to save time and material by preventing breakdowns and improving the overall predictability of industrial processes. However, due to the lack of high quality monitoring data and only little experience concerning the applicability of analysis methods, real-world implementations of Predictive Maintenance are still rare. Within this contribution, we present a method, to detect concept drift in data streams as potential indication for defective system behavior and depict initial tests on synthetic data sets. Further on, we present a real-world case study with industrial radial fans and discuss promising results gained from applying the detailed approach in this scope.","Predictive maintenance,Machine learning,Concept drift detection,Time series regression,Industrial radial fans",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,,"ROLLING,ELEMENT,BEARINGS,FAULT-DIAGNOSIS,ROTATING,MACHINES,INDUSTRY,4.0,MANIFOLD,EXTRACTION,REGRESSION,KURTOSIS,NOISE",COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,,

Its diagnosis is usually corroborated by neuroimaging data such as DaTSCAN neuroimages that allow visualizing the possible dopamine deficiency. During the last decade, a number of computer systems have been proposed to automatically analyze DaTSCAN neuroimages, eliminating the subjectivity inherent to the visual examination of the data. In this work, we propose a computer system based on machine learning to separate Parkinsonian patients and control subjects using the size and shape of the striatal region, modeled from DaTSCAN data. First, an algorithm based on adaptative thresholding is used to parcel the striatum. This region is then divided into two according to the brain hemisphere division and characterized with 152 measures, extracted from the volume and its three possible 2-dimensional projections. Afterwards, the Bhattacharyya distance is used to discard the least discriminative measures and, finally, the neuroimage category is estimated by means of a Support Vector Machine classifier. This method was evaluated using a dataset with 189 DaTSCAN neuroimages, obtaining an accuracy rate over 94%. This rate outperforms those obtained by previous approaches that use the intensity of each striatal voxel as a feature.","Parkinsonism,DaTSCAN,striatum,machine learning,striatal morphology",Article,"WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD, 5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,5.439,"PARTIAL,LEAST-SQUARES,FP-CIT,INTENSITY,NORMALIZATION,DISEASE,SPECT,CLASSIFICATION,PET",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS,https://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/58030/1/Segovia_Assisted.pdf,

In this work, the feasibility of our recently proposed MRI-only workflow in clinically relevant scenarios is investigated and the necessary modifications in image acquisition and processing pipeline are proposed for transition to the clinic.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four prostate phantoms with a total of 321 I-125 implanted dummy seeds and three patients with a total of 168 implanted seeds were scanned using a gradient echo sequence on 1.5 T and 3T MR scanners. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was performed for seed visualization. Before QSM, the seed-induced distortion correction was performed followed by edge enhancement. Seed localization was performed using spatial clustering algorithms and was compared with CT. In addition, feasibility of the proposed method on detection of prostatic calcifications was studied.
RESULTS: The proposed susceptibility-based algorithm generated consistent positive contrast for the seeds in phantoms and patients. All the 321 seeds in the four phantoms were correctly identified; the MR-derived seeds centroids agreed well with CT-derived positions (average error = 0.5 +/- 0.3 mm). The proposed algorithm for seed visualization was found to be orientation invariant. In patient cases, all seeds were visualized and correctly localized (average error = 1.2 +/- 0.9 mm); no significant differences between dose volume histogram parameters were found. Prostatic calcifications were depicted with negative contrast on QSM and spatially agreed with CT.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MRI-based approach has great potential to replace the current CT-based practices. Additional patient studies are necessary to further optimize and validate the workflow.

Nevertheless, in order to functionally replace a human limb, it is essential that each movement is properly controlled. This is the goal of prosthesis control, which has become a growing research field in the last decades, with the ultimate goal of reproducing biological limb control. Therefore, exploration and development of prosthesis control are crucial to improve many aspects of an amputee's life. Nowadays, a large divergence between academia and industry has become evident in commercial systems. Although several studies propose more natural control systems with promising results, basic one degree of freedom (DoF), a control switching system is the most widely used option in industry because of simplicity, robustness and inertia. A few classification controlled prostheses have emerged in the last years but they are still a low percentage of the used ones. One of the factors that generate this situation is the lack of robustness of more advanced control algorithms in daily life activities outside of laboratory conditions. Because of this, research has shifted towards more functional prosthesis control. This work reviews the most recent literature in upper limb prosthetic control. It covers commonly used variants of possible biological inputs, its processing and translation to actual control, mostly focusing on electromyograms as well as the problems it will have to overcome in near future.","myoelectric control,prosthesis,electromyography,EMG,upper limb,feature extraction,data acquisition,sampling frequency,segmentation,machine learning,classification,regression,feedback,human adaptation,co-adaptation,robustness,usability,review",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,2.408,"TARGETED,MUSCLE,REINNERVATION,EMG,PATTERN-RECOGNITION,OF-THE-ART,REAL-TIME,SURFACE,EMG,HAND,PROSTHESIS,NEURAL-NETWORKS,CLASSIFICATION,ROBUST,FORCE",ELECTRONICS,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/8/11/1244/pdf,

In this paper, we propose a new graph-based semi-supervised broad learning system (GSS-BLS), which combines the graph label propagation method to obtain pseudo-labels and then trains the GSS-BLS classifier together with other labeled samples. Three BCI competition datasets are used to assess the GSS-BLS approach and five comparison algorithms: BLS, ELM, HELM, LapSVM and SMIR. The experimental results show that GSS-BLS achieves satisfying Cohen's kappa values in three datasets. GSS-BLS achieves the better results of each subject in the 2-class and 4-class datasets and has significant improvements compared with original BLS except subject C6.

Existing visual evaluation methods require hand-crafted features for classification, and conduct feature extraction and classification in a separated manner. In this paper, we conduct a designed experiment to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of various visual fatigue levels, and present a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture named MorletInceptionNet to detect visual fatigue using EEG as input, which exploits the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel EEG signals. Our MorletInceptionNet adopts a joint space-time-frequency features extraction scheme in which Morlet wavelet-like kernels are used for time-frequency raw feature extraction and inception architecture are further used to extract multi-scale temporal features. Then, the multi-scale temporal features are concatenated and fed to the fully connected layer for visual fatigue evaluation using classification. In experiment evaluation, we compare our method with five state-of-the-art methods, and the results demonstrate that our model achieve overally the best performance better performance for two widely used evaluation metrics, i.e., classification accuracy and kappa value. Furthermore, we use input-perturbation network-prediction correlation maps to conduct in-depth analysis into the reason why the proposed method outperforms other methods. The results suggest that our model is sensitive to the perturbation of beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands. Furthermore, their spatial patterns are of high correlation with that of the corresponding power spectral densities which are used as evaluation features traditionally.

This paper addresses a lossless compression of malaria-infected red blood cell images using deep learning. Specifically, we investigate a practical approach where images are first classified before being compressed using stacked autoencoders. We provide probabilistic analysis on the impact of misclassification rates on compression performance in terms of the information-theoretic measure of entropy. We then use malaria infection image datasets to evaluate the relations between misclassification rates and actually obtainable compressed bit rates using Golomb-Rice codes. Simulation results show that the joint pattern classification/compression method provides more efficient compression than several mainstream lossless compression techniques, such as JPEG2000, JPEG-LS, CALIC, and WebP, by exploiting common features extracted by deep learning on large datasets. This study provides new insight into the interplay between classification accuracy and compression bitrates.

Most algorithms for automated sleep apnea detection use a set of human-engineered features, potentially missing important sleep apnea markers.

This article attempts to explore optimal decoding algorithms for an IBK paradigm using EEG signals with application to neural cursor control. The study is based on an offline analysis of 32 healthy subjects' training data. Various machine learning techniques were implemented to predict the kinematics of the computer cursor using EEG signals during the training tasks. Our results showed that a linear regression least squares model yielded the highest goodness-of-fit scores in the cursor kinematics model (70 in horizontal prediction and 40 in vertical prediction using a Theil-Sen regressor). Additionally, the contribution of each EEG channel on the predictability of cursor kinematics was examined for horizontal and vertical directions, separately. A directional classifier was also proposed to classify horizontal versus vertical cursor kinematics using EEG signals. By incorporating features extracted from specific frequency bands, we achieved 80 classification accuracy in differentiating horizontal and vertical cursor movements.

Therefore, the intent of individuals should be identified and the device movement should adhere to it. Skeletal muscles contract synergistically to produce defined lower limb movements, so unique contraction patterns in lower extremity musculature may provide a means of device joint control. Ultrasound (US) imaging enables direct measurement of the local deformation of muscle segments. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower limb movements. Methods: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate US features of the rectus femoris muscle during a non-weight-bearing knee flexionextension experiment by nine able-bodied subjects. Five US features of the skeletal muscle tissue were studied, namely thickness, angle between aponeuroses, pennation angle, fascicle length, and echogenicity. A multiscale ridge filter was utilized to extract the structures in the image and a random sample consensus (RANSAC) model was used to segment muscle aponeuroses and fascicles. A localization scheme further guided RANSAC to enable tracking in a US image sequence. Gaussian process regression models were trained using segmented features to estimate both knee joint angle and angular velocity. Results: The proposed segmentation-estimation approach could estimate knee joint angle and angular velocity with an average root mean square error value of 7.45 and 0.262 rads, respectively. The average processing rate was 36 framess that is promising toward real-time implementation.

For further bettering their performances, batch normalization and innovative double batch training is included here to achieve accelerated training and alleviate the problem of overfitting. Additionally, a leaky ReLU activation function has also been used in DCNN to overcome dying ReLU problem. The experiments have been performed on self-generated dataset of 20 Devanagari words with 79 characters acquired from 10 subjects using 16 channel actiCAP Xpress EEG recorder. The experimental results illustrated that the proposed DCNN is able to detect 88.22% correct targets in just three trials. Moreover, it also provides ITR of 20.58 bits per minutes, which is significantly higher than existing techniques.","Brain-computer interface (BCI),Devanagari script (DS),stacked autoencoder (SAE),deep convolution neural network (DCNN),P300 speller",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,SIGNAL,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,,

Thus, a frequent and objective PD assessment is highly valuable for effective health management of people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). Here, we propose a method for monitoring PwP by stochastically modeling the relationships between wrist movements during unscripted daily activities and corresponding annotations about clinical displays of movement abnormalities. We approach the estimation of PD motor signs by independently modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes of commonly observed movement abnormalities in PwP including tremor, (non-tremulous) bradykinesia, and (non-tremulous) dyskinesia. We use clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models, thus allowing our multi-layer Gaussian process prediction models to estimate not only their presence but also their severities. The experimental validation of our approach demonstrates strong agreement of the model predictions with these PD annotations. Our results show that the proposed method produces promising results in objective monitoring of movement abnormalities of PD in the presence of arbitrary and unknown voluntary motions, and makes an important step toward continuous monitoring of PD in the home environment.","Ambient intelligence,Gaussian processes,medical information system,wearable sensors",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"SOCIETY-SPONSORED,REVISION,SCALE,MDS-UPDRS,BRADYKINESIA,TREMOR,PATHOPHYSIOLOGY,FLUCTUATIONS,DYSKINESIA,DIAGNOSIS,ACCURACY",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1475726/document.pdf,

Although many automated methods have been proposed, most use a multi-stage processing pipeline to categorize nuclei, leading to cumbersome, low-throughput, and error-prone assessments. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network for single-stage nucleus recognition. Methods: Instead of conducting direct pixel-wise classification, we formulate nucleus identification as a deep structured regression model. For each input image, it produces multiple proximity maps, each of which corresponds to one nucleus category and exhibits strong responses in central regions of the nuclei. In addition, by taking into consideration the nucleus distribution in histopathology images, we further introduce an auxiliary task, region of interest (ROI) extraction, to assist and boost the nucleus quantification with weak ROI annotation. The proposed network can be learned in an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel manner for simultaneous nucleus detection and classification. Results: We have evaluated this network on a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Ki67 image dataset, and the experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches. Conclusion: We present a new, pixel-to-pixel deep neural network with two sibling branches for effective nucleus recognition and observe that learning with another relevant task, ROI extraction, can further boost individual nucleus localization and classification. Significance: Our method provides a clean, single-stage nucleus recognition pipeline for histopathology image analysis, especially a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification, which would potentially benefit individual object quantification in whole-slide images.","Nucleus classification,nucleus detection fully convolutional networks,Ki67,neuroendocrine tumor,microscopy images",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"ROBUST,CELL,DETECTION,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,NETWORKS,INDEX",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,,

John","Dantas H,Warren DJ,Wendelken SM,Davis TS,Clark GA,Mathews VJ",Dantas H,10.1109/TBME.2019.2901882,Oregon State University,"Significance: The performance of traditional approaches to decoding movement intent from electromyograms (EMGs) and other biological signals commonly degrade over time. Furthermore, conventional algorithms for training neural network based decoders may not perform well outside the domain of the state transitions observed during training. The work presented in this paper mitigates both these problems, resulting in an approach that has the potential to substantially improve the quality of life of the people with limb loss. Objective: This paper presents and evaluates the performance of four decoding methods for volitional movement intent from intramuscular EMG signals. Methods: The decoders are trained using the dataset aggregation (DAgger) algorithm, in which the training dataset is augmented during each training iteration based on the decoded estimates from previous iterations. Four competing decoding methods, namely polynomial Kalman filters (KFs), multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, were developed. The performances of the four decoding methods were evaluated using EMG datasets recorded from two human volunteers with transradial amputation. Short-term analyses, in which the training and cross-validation data came from the same dataset, and long-term analyses, in which the training and testing were done in different datasets, were performed. Results: Short-term analyses of the decoders demonstrated that CNN and MLP decoders performed significantly better than KF and LSTM decoders, showing an improvement of up to 60% in the normalized mean-square decoding error in cross-validation tests. Long-term analyses indicated that the CNN, MLP, and LSTM decoders performed significantly better than a KF-based decoder at most analyzed cases of temporal separations (0-150 days) between the acquisition of the training and testing datasets. Conclusion: The short-term and long-term performances of MLP- and CNN-based decoders trained with DAgger demonstrated their potential to provide more accurate and naturalistic control of prosthetic hands than alternate approaches.","Biomedical signal processing,deep learning,Kalman filter,learning systems,machine learning,motor intent decoder,neural engineering,neural network,reinforcement learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"NEURAL-CONTROL,INFORMATION,CURSOR,CORTEX,ROBUST,HAND",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2019.2901882,

MTBI is a growing public health problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in USA. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete measures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of the previous works, which use hand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more discriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field thus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training. This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to directly classify a subject from MRIs. To overcome this challenge, we first apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn patch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different brain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-words approach. We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects (including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex-matched healthy controls) and compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches.

For data acquisition, we established rat models of compression spinal cord injury at the C4, C5, and C6 levels to induce cervical myelopathy. After making the compression injury, we collected somatosensory evoked potentials and extracted their time-frequency components. We then used the random forests classification system to analyze the evoked potential dataset that was obtained from the three groups of model rats. Evaluation of the classifier performance revealed an overall classification accuracy of 84.72%, confirming that the random forests method was able to separate the time-frequency components of somatosensory evoked potentials from rats under different conditions.

In order to enhance productivity, evaluating the productivity of wafer maps prior to production and optimizing the productivity of wafer maps is one of the most effective solutions. The productivity of a wafer map is evaluated in advance by considering various factors affecting wafer productivity such as: gross dies, shot counts, lithography throughputs, mask field occupancy (MFO), prices, etc. Manufacturing process information is not determined at the initial wafer map design stage. Predicting the yield of new wafer maps before fabrication is a difficult challenge due to lack of process information. However, a yield prediction model is required to precisely evaluate the productivity of new wafer maps, because the yield is directly related to the productivity and the design of wafer map affects the yield. In this paper, we propose a novel yield prediction model based on deep learning algorithms. Our approach exploits spatial relationships among positions of dies on a wafer and die-level yield variations collected from a wafer test without process parameters. By modeling these spatial features, the accuracy of yield prediction significantly increased. Furthermore, experimental results showed that the proposed yield model and approach helps to design wafer maps with up to 8.59 higher productivity.","Semiconductor device modeling,Productivity,Predictive models,Data models,Fabrication,Lithography,Yield modeling,wafer map,wafer productivity,semiconductor manufacturing,machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Physics",,2.479,NEURAL-NETWORKS,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING,,

A novel method to identify the idle running period and eliminate noise is developed using discrete wavelet decomposition (DWD) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT).

A new k-fold eXtreme Gradient Boosting (k-fold-XGBoost) algorithm after training and optimization is integrated into the material removal (MR) model. The test results indicate that the values forecasted by the model are consistent with the measured values. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of material removal evaluated by the model is 4.373%, which shows a better performance than the reported results which are in the range of 6.4 to 8.72%.

However, it requires large amount of memory and extensive time for the training. It is especially challenging to train the reconstruction networks for three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) because of the high resolution of CT images. The purpose of this work is to reduce the memory and time consumption of the training of the reconstruction networks for CT to make it practical for current hardware, while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images.
MethodsWe unrolled the proximal gradient descent algorithm for iterative image reconstruction to finite iterations and replaced the terms related to the penalty function with trainable convolutional neural networks (CNN). The network was trained greedily iteration by iteration in the image domain on patches, which requires reasonable amount of memory and time on mainstream graphics processing unit (GPU). To overcome the local-minimum problem caused by greedy learning, we used deep UNet as the CNN and incorporated separable quadratic surrogate with ordered subsets for data fidelity, so that the solution could escape from easy local minimums and achieve better image quality.
ResultsThe proposed method achieved comparable image quality with state-of-the-art neural network for CT image reconstruction on two-dimensional (2D) sparse-view and limited-angle problems on the low-dose CT challenge dataset. The difference in root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) was within [-0.23,0.47] HU and [0,0.001], respectively, with 95% confidence level. For three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction with ordinary-size CT volume, the proposed method only needed 2 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) memory and 0.45 s per training iteration as minimum requirement, whereas existing methods may require 417 GB and 31 min. The proposed method achieved improved performance compared to total variation- and dictionary learning-based iterative reconstruction for both 2D and 3D problems.
ConclusionsWe proposed a training-time computationally efficient neural network for CT image reconstruction. The proposed method achieved comparable image quality with state-of-the-art neural network for CT reconstruction, with significantly reduced memory and time requirement during training. The proposed method is applicable to 3D image reconstruction problems such as cone-beam CT and tomosynthesis on mainstream GPUs.","computed tomography,image reconstruction,neural network",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"LOW-DOSE,CT,ALGORITHM,QUALITY,CNN",MEDICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03999,

It has been widely used in clinical diagnosis, scientific research, and drug testing. PET is a kind of emission computed tomography. Its basic imaging principle is to use the positron annihilation radiation generated by radionuclide decay to generate gamma photon images. However, in practical applications, due to the low gamma photon counting rate, limited acquisition time, inconsistent detector characteristics, and electronic noise, measured PET projection data often contain considerable noise, which results in ill-conditioned PET images. Therefore, determining how to obtain high-quality reconstructed PET images suitable for clinical applications is a valuable research topic. In this context, this paper presents an image reconstruction algorithm based on patch-based regularization and dictionary learning (DL) called the patch-DL algorithm. Compared to other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can retain more image details while suppressing noise. Methods Expectation-maximization (EM)-like image updating, image smoothing, pixel-by-pixel image fusion, and DL are the four steps of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. We used a two-dimensional (2D) brain phantom to evaluate the proposed algorithm by simulating sinograms that contained random Poisson noise. We also quantitatively compared the patch-DL algorithm with a pixel-based algorithm, a patch-based algorithm, and an adaptive dictionary learning (AD) algorithm. Results Through computer simulations, we demonstrated the advantages of the patch-DL method over the pixel-, patch-, and AD-based methods in terms of the tradeoff between noise suppression and detail retention in reconstructed images. Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method results in a better performance statistically [according to the mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (CORR), and root mean square error (RMSE)] in considered region of interests (ROI) with two simulated count levels. Additionally, to analyze whether the results among these methods have significant differences, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to calculate the corresponding P values. The results show that most of the P P> 0.01 < 0.05. Therefore, our method can achieve a better quantitative performance than those of traditional methods. Conclusions The results show that the proposed algorithm has the potential to improve the quality of PET image reconstruction. Since the proposed algorithm was validated only with simulated 2D data, it still needs to be further validated with real three-dimensional data. In the future, we intend to explore GPU parallelization technology to further improve the computational efficiency and shorten the computation time.","dictionary learning,image reconstruction,patch regularization,positron emission tomography",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"EXPECTATION,MAXIMIZATION,ALGORITHM,ROBUST,UNCERTAINTY,PRINCIPLES,SPARSE,REPRESENTATION,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,CT,RECONSTRUCTION,SIGNAL,RECOVERY,LIKELIHOOD,MAXIMUM",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6899708?pdf=render,

Fred III","Desai PS,Higgs CF",Higgs CF,10.3390/met9111176,Rice University,"The powder bed additive manufacturing (AM) process is comprised of two repetitive steps-spreading of powder and selective fusing or binding the spread layer. The spreading step consists of a rolling and sliding spreader which imposes a shear flow and normal stress on an AM powder between itself and an additively manufactured substrate. Improper spreading can result in parts with a rough exterior and porous interior. Thus it is necessary to develop predictive capabilities for this spreading step. A rheometry-calibrated model based on the polydispersed discrete element method (DEM) and validated for single layer spreading was applied to study the relationship between spreader speeds and spread layer properties of an industrial grade Ti-6Al-4V powder. The spread layer properties used to quantify spreadability of the AM powder, i.e., the ease with which an AM powder spreads under a set of load conditions, include mass of powder retained in the sampling region after spreading, spread throughput, roughness of the spread layer and porosity of the spread layer. Since the physics-based DEM simulations are computationally expensive, physics model-based machine learning, in the form of a feed forward, back propagation neural network, was employed to interpolate between the highly nonlinear results obtained by running modest numbers of DEM simulations. The minimum accuracy of the trained neural network was 96%. A spreading process map was generated to concisely present the relationship between spreader speeds and spreadability parameters.","powder-bed additive manufacturing (AM),powder spreading,spreading process map,discrete element method (DEM),machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,2.487,"SIMULATION,DESIGN,SEGREGATION,PREDICTION",METALS,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/11/1176/pdf,

Here, we first establish a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of OPV materials. We explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, ASCII strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various ML algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of our approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML is a powerful tool to prescreen new OPV materials, thus accelerating the development of the OPV field.","CLEAN ENERGY PROJECT,NEURAL-NETWORKS,FEATURES,MODELS",Article,"AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE, 1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,16.45,"CLEAN,ENERGY,PROJECT,NEURAL-NETWORKS,FEATURES,MODELS",SCIENCE ADVANCES,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839938,

Unfortunately, aquatic product safety incidents occur now and then, thus new kinds of analytical techniques that are fast, nondestructive, and simple to operate would be advantageous. This article addressed a machine olfactory system for recognition of the storage life of a whole living mitten crab. A type of deep learning algorithm, namely stacked denoising auto-encoders algorithm (SdA), was applied to extract effective features of the machine olfactory system sensors' responses. The traditional feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were used for the purposes of comparison. Then the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented for further qualitative classification. In addition, the crabs were analyzed for total volatile basic nitrogen and total viable counts during storage process. Validation experiments showed that the highest recognition rate (96.67%) was achieved by using SdA with SVM. This study may present a promising instruction for the storage life recognition of the living crab. Practical Application Evaluation of the freshness of mitten crab is of considerable importance to guarantee mitten crab quality. However, to our best knowledge, few reports on the development of an electronic-nose for nondestructive evaluation of the quality of whole living crab are available. A machine olfactory system for recognition of the storage life of a whole living mitten crab was present in this study. Validation experiments showed the highest recognition rate based on the system. In summary, the metal-semiconductor sensor-based machine olfactory system presents some advantages including fast detecting, repeatability, and nondestructive. In the future, with the improvement of sensor performance and development of pattern recognition, it will be a favorable weapon for protecting the interests of consumers in aquatic market.","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE,ELECTRONIC NOSE,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Food Science & Technology",,2.417,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,ELECTRONIC,NOSE,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM",JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING,,
