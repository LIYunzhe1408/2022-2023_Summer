1,Lymph node detection method based on multisource transfer learning and convolutional neural network,30,2,298-310,"Ma Yingran,Peng Yanjun","Ma YR,Peng YJ",Peng YJ,10.1002/ima.22371,Shandong University of Science & Technology,"Recently years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of computer vision tasks. However, training a CNN from scratch is difficult because it requires a large amount of labeled training data, which remains a challenge in medical imaging domain. To this end, deep transfer learning (TL) technique is widely used for many medical image tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multisource transfer learning CNN model for lymph node detection. The mechanism behind it is straightforward. Point-wise (1 x 1) convolution is used to fuse multisource transfer learning knowledge. Concretely, we view the transferred features as priori domain knowledge and 1 x 1 convolutional operation is implemented after pre-trained convolution layers to adaptively combine the transfer information for target task. In order to learn non-linear transferred features and prevent over-fitting, we present an encode process for the pre-trained convolution kernels. At last, based on convolutional factorization technique, we train the proposed CNN model and the encoder process jointly, which improves the feasibility of our approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on lymph node (LN) dataset: 388 mediastinal LNs labeled by radiologists in 90 patient CT scans, and 595 abdominal LNs in 86 patient CT scans for LN detection. Our method demonstrates sensitivities of about 85%/71% at 3 FP/vol. and 92%/85% at 6 FP/vol. for mediastinum and abdomen respectively, which compares favorably to previous methods.","convolutional neural network,lymph node detection,multisource transfer learning,point-wise convolutional operation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,2.03,SEGMENTATION,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,,
2,On the effects of pseudorandom and quantum-random number generators in soft computing,24,12,9243-9256,"Bird Jordan J.,Ekart Aniko,Faria Diego R.","Bird JJ,Ekart A,Faria DR",Bird JJ,10.1007/s00500-019-04450-0,Aston University,"In this work, we argue that the implications of pseudorandom and quantum-random number generators (PRNG and QRNG) inexplicably affect the performances and behaviours of various machine learning models that require a random input. These implications are yet to be explored in soft computing until this work. We use a CPU and a QPU to generate random numbers for multiple machine learning techniques. Random numbers are employed in the random initial weight distributions of dense and convolutional neural networks, in which results show a profound difference in learning patterns for the two. In 50 dense neural networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), QRNG increases over PRNG for accent classification at + 0.1%, and QRNG exceeded PRNG for mental state EEG classification by + 2.82%. In 50 convolutional neural networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), the MNIST and CIFAR-10 problems are benchmarked, and in MNIST the QRNG experiences a higher starting accuracy than the PRNG but ultimately only exceeds it by 0.02%. In CIFAR-10, the QRNG outperforms PRNG by + 0.92%. The n-random split of a Random Tree is enhanced towards and new Quantum Random Tree (QRT) model, which has differing classification abilities to its classical counterpart, 200 trees are trained and compared (100 PRNG/100 QRNG). Using the accent and EEG classification data sets, a QRT seemed inferior to a RT as it performed on average worse by - 0.12%. This pattern is also seen in the EEG classification problem, where a QRT performs worse than a RT by - 0.28%. Finally, the QRT is ensembled into a Quantum Random Forest (QRF), which also has a noticeable effect when compared to the standard Random Forest (RF). Ten to 100 ensembles of trees are benchmarked for the accent and EEG classification problems. In accent classification, the best RF (100 RT) outperforms the best QRF (100 QRF) by 0.14% accuracy. In EEG classification, the best RF (100 RT) outperforms the best QRF (100 QRT) by 0.08% but is extremely more complex, requiring twice the amount of trees in committee. All differences are observed to be situationally positive or negative and thus are likely data dependent in their observed functional behaviour.","Quantum computing,Soft computing,Machine learning,Neural networks,Classification",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Computer Science,,3.518,"COLONY,OPTIMIZATION,ALGORITHM,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MODEL",SOFT COMPUTING,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00500-019-04450-0.pdf,
3,BoVSG: bag of visual SubGraphs for remote sensing scene classification,41,5,1986-2003,"Amiri Khitem,Farah Mohamed,Leloglu Ugur Murat","Amiri K,Farah M,Leloglu UM",Amiri K,10.1080/01431161.2019.1681602,Universite de la Manouba,"Remote sensing scene classification is gaining much more interest in the recent few years for many strategic fields such as security, land cover and land use monitoring. Several methods have been proposed in the literature and they can be divided into three main classes based on the features used: handcrafted features, features obtained by unsupervised learning and those obtained from deep learning. Handcrafted features are generally time consuming and suboptimal. Unsupervised learning based features which have been proposed later gave better results but their performances are still limited because they mainly rely on shallow networks and are not able to extract powerful features. Deep learning based features are recently investigated and gave interesting results. But, they cannot be usually used because of the scarcity of labelled remote sensing images and are also computationally expensive. Most importantly, whatever kind of feature is used, the neighbourhood information of them is ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel remote sensing scene representation and classification approach called Bag of Visual SubGraphs (BoVSG). First, each image is segmented into superpixels in order to summarize the image content while retaining relevant information. Then, the superpixels from all images are clustered according to their colour and texture features and a random label is assigned to each cluster that probably corresponds to some material or land cover type. Thus superpixels belonging to the same cluster have the same label. Afterwards, each image is modelled with a graph where nodes correspond to labelled superpixels and edges model spatial neighbourhoods. Finally, each image is represented by a histogram of the most frequent subgraphs corresponding to land cover adjacency patterns. This way, local spatial relations between the nodes are also taken into account. Resultant feature vectors are classified using standard classification algorithms. The proposed approach is tested on three popular datasets and its performance outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning methods. Besides its accuracy, the proposed approach is computationally much less expensive than deep learning methods.","CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,ALGORITHM,CLIQUES,CUTS",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,ALGORITHM,CLIQUES,CUTS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,,

So as to investigate the performance of this approach under different types of loadings, it is essential to obtain the displacement-load curve of the stone columns. In this paper, the effect of geotextile-encased stone columns has been evaluated based on 39 large scale tests in sand with different silt content. Furthermore, artificial neural network is carried on to estimate the shear resistance of the modeled stone columns by considering some factors such as fine content of bed soil, area replacement of stone columns, and normal stress on the sample. In the present research, artificial neural networks optimized by colonial competitive algorithm (ANN-ICA) were used and their results were compared with other methods. The obtained results showed that ICA-based artificial neural networks predicted lateral bearing capacity of short piles with a correlation coefficient of 0.9738 for training data and 0.9913 for test data. Moreover, the results of the model showed the superiority of ICA-based artificial neural networks compared to back-propagation artificial neural network methods.","Geotextile-encased stone columns,Sand,Shear resistance,Neural network",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Engineering,,,"SOFT,CLAY,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,BEARING,CAPACITY,PREDICTION,BEHAVIOR,PILE,TESTS",GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,

Due to complex morphology of cutting process, edge and surface defects and elevated cutting forces and temperature are the main observations if non-adequate cutting parameters are selected. Therefore, modeling surface roughness and cutting forces in the milling process are of prime importance. Due to the ability of neuro-fuzzy networks to maintain appropriate modeling with investigation of uncertainties and the capacity of meta-heuristic approaches to set the coefficients of these networks precisely, in the present study, the coupled models of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS-type fuzzy neural networks) and interval type 2 fuzzy neural networks with evolutionary learning algorithms including particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) were used to predict the mean values of directional cutting forces as well as average surface roughness (Ra) in milling aluminum alloys (AA6061, AA2024, AA7075) under various cutting conditions and insert coatings. The main innovation of the present study refers to implementation of IT2FNN- PSO method in the machining operations. No similar research in this regards was found in the literature. According to the results, it was found that the proposed methods led to excellent and precise modeling results with high correlation rates with experimental outputs. The use of IT2FNN-PSO led to better performance as compared to observations made in other two ANFIS-based models aforementioned.","ANFIS,Interval type 2 fuzzy neural networks,Milling,Surface quality,Cutting force",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,"ROUGHNESS,PREDICTION,MULTIPLE-REGRESSION,GENETIC,ALGORITHM,INFERENCE,SYSTEM,CNC",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,

One factor affecting the ability to aggregate large medical image collections for research is the lack of infrastructure for automated data annotation. Among all imaging modalities, annotation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is particularly challenging due to the non-standard labeling of MR image types. In this work, we aimed to train a deep neural network to annotate MR image sequence type for scans of brain tumor patients. We focused on the four most common MR sequence types within neuroimaging: T1-weighted (T1W), T1-weighted post-gadolinium contrast (T1Gd), T2-weighted (T2W), and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Our repository contains images acquired using a variety of pulse sequences, sequence parameters, field strengths, and scanner manufacturers. Image selection was agnostic to patient demographics, diagnosis, and the presence of tumor in the imaging field of view. We used a total of 14,400 two-dimensional images, each visualizing a different part of the brain. Data was split into train, validation, and test sets (9600, 2400, and 2400 images, respectively) and sets consisted of equal-sized groups of image types. Overall, the model reached an accuracy of 99% on the test set. Our results showed excellent performance of deep learning techniques in predicting sequence types for brain tumor MR images.

Principal component analysis separated ORG and CONV coffees but the distinction among the producing regions of Brazilian coffee was not possible. Partial least squares discriminant analysis classified all ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation. Similarly, linear discriminant analysis was able to discriminate 100% and 81% of ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation, respectively, in which total phenolic content (TPC), ferric reducing antioxidant activity, and caffeic acid were the main discriminant variables. Overall 100% of samples from Parana, Minas Gerais, and blended samples were correctly classified, where TPC, flavonoids, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, caffeic acid, pH, and soluble solids were the main discriminant variables. Support vector machines classified 95% ORG and 88% CONV, 100% Coffea arabica, and 88% and 78% coffees produced in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. k-Nearest neighbors was effective in distinguishing 100% CONV, 89% ORG, 100% coffees from Sao Paulo, and 100% C. arabica coffees. Overall, HPLC data and simple physicochemical parameters allied to chemometrics were effective in authenticating the cultivation system and the botanical origin of Brazilian coffees. Practical Application Coffee adulteration is a serious problem in the food chain as some fraudsters replace coffee powder by other cheaper products. In the case of organic coffee, this scenario is even worse as still there is not a universal method to differentiate conventionally grown coffee from its organic counterpart. In addition, Brazilian coffee is produced in different regions and the commercial value varies. Therefore, we analyzed some physicochemical, chemical, and antioxidant properties of Brazilian coffees from distinct origins and classified the samples using chemometrics. Our approach seems to be interesting for quality control purposes.","discriminant analysis,multivariate statistics,one-class classifiers,organic farming,phenolic compounds",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Food Science & Technology,,3.377,"INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY,BIOACTIVE,COMPOUNDS,ANTIOXIDANT,ACTIVITY,SCAVENGING,ACTIVITY,CHLOROGENIC,ACIDS,FOLIN-CIOCALTEU,ARABICA,CAFFEINE,ROBUSTA,QUANTIFICATION",JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE,,

Variations in these parameters significantly affect the overall performance of the MFC reactor. In this regard, to correlate the cell performance, conversion efficiency, and selectivity of the MFC reactor with the variability of these input parameters, we carry out a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) based on a mechanistic mathematical model for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO. The MCS is conducted in two scenarios: first, by varying the stochastic parameters individually (IND), and second, by varying all of the stochastic parameters simultaneously (SIM), at different cell potentials. These parameters are then ranked on the basis of their contributions to the cell performance, the conversion efficiency, and the selectivity, thereby providing insights into optimum ranges of operation. The charge-transfer coefficient toward CO and H-2 formation, catalyst properties, are the most sensitive parameters toward the cell performance and conversion efficiency and the selectivity, respectively, at all cell potentials. The thickness of the catalyst layer has a significant effect on the cell performance and conversion efficiency during the IND scenario, but its relative effect during the SIM scenario is not significant at all cell potentials. Furthermore, we derive reduced regression models based on supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the overall cell performance without having to solve the complete set of equations and also statistically discuss the distribution of overall cell performance at various cell potentials.","CARBON-DIOXIDE,REDUCTION,CONVERSION,PERFORMANCE,CELL,ELECTROLYTE,CHEMICALS,EFFICIENT,FUELS,ELECTROREDUCTION",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Engineering,,4.013,"CARBON-DIOXIDE,REDUCTION,CONVERSION,PERFORMANCE,CELL,ELECTROLYTE,CHEMICALS,EFFICIENT,FUELS,ELECTROREDUCTION",INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH,,

In recent years, a broad array of materials property databases have emerged as part of a digital transformation of materials science. However, recent technological advances in ML are not fully exploited because of the insufficient volume and diversity of materials data. An ML framework called ""transfer learning"" has considerable potential to overcome the problem of limited amounts of materials data. Transfer learning relies on the concept that various property types, such as physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, are physically interrelated. For a given target property to be predicted from a limited supply of training data, models of related proxy properties are pretrained using sufficient data; these models capture common features relevant to the target task. Repurposing of such machine-acquired features on the target task yields outstanding prediction performance even with exceedingly small data sets, as if highly experienced human experts can make rational inferences even for considerably less experienced tasks. In this study, to facilitate widespread use of transfer learning, we develop a pretrained model library called XenonPy.MDL. In this first release, the library comprises more than 140 000 pretrained models for various properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic crystalline materials. Along with these pretrained models, we describe some outstanding successes of transfer learning in different scenarios such as building models with only dozens of materials data, increasing the ability of extrapolative prediction through a strategic model transfer, and so on. Remarkably, transfer learning has autonomously identified rather nontrivial transferability across different properties transcending the different disciplines of materials science; for example, our analysis has revealed underlying bridges between small molecules and polymers and between organic and inorganic chemistry.","THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY,DESIGN",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,15.435,"THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY,DESIGN",ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00804,

Diamente et al. model and modified two-term exponential-V model were determined as the best ones describing drying curves for natural and forced drying air systems, respectively. The ANNs with 4-9-9-1 and 3-9-1 topologies, log-sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer functions, and Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm presented the best results for the former and latter systems, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that ANN modeling had much better performance in prediction of drying curves with respect to statistical analyses. Moisture diffusivity values were obtained in a range of 0.932x10-10-11.976x10-10m2/s and 2.209x10-10-9.848x10-10m2/s for the systems, respectively. Activation energies were determined as 88,509, 60,344, and 44,806 W/kg for the former system and 36.88, 29.66, and 18.59 kJ/mol for the latter system with an increase in the thickness of samples. Practical applications The main aim of drying food products is the reduction of moisture content up to a certain level to achieve the smallest possible amount of the microbiological spoilage. This process has a considerable effect on the drying kinetics and quality of the dried product as well. Infrared (IR) heating, as an alternative drying method for agricultural products, is efficient to preserve the main characteristics and to shorten drying time. It is important to investigate the effect operating parameters of IR dryer on the mentioned cases. Our studies have clearly displayed that IR heating of pumpkin samples can result in high heating rate and fast drying. Therefore, this alternative approach could be employed as an energy saving drying method along with improved drying efficiency and better product quality in comparison with the common drying methods. Study results are useful for producers of not only dried pumpkins but also other agricultural products.","QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS,BELL PEPPER,KINETICS,MOISTURE,TOMATO,SLICES,CARROT,AIR,OPTIMIZATION,SIMULATION",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Food Science & Technology,,2.271,"QUALITY,CHARACTERISTICS,BELL,PEPPER,KINETICS,MOISTURE,TOMATO,SLICES,CARROT,AIR,OPTIMIZATION,SIMULATION",JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION,,

Methods FatSegNet is composed of three stages: (a) Consistent localization of the abdominal region using two 2D-Competitive Dense Fully Convolutional Networks (CDFNet), (b) Segmentation of adipose tissue on three views by independent CDFNets, and (c) View aggregation. FatSegNet is validated by: (1) comparison of segmentation accuracy (sixfold cross-validation), (2) test-retest reliability, (3) generalizability to randomly selected manually re-edited cases, and (4) replication of age and sex effects in the Rhineland Study-a large prospective population cohort. Results The CDFNet demonstrates increased accuracy and robustness compared to traditional deep learning networks. FatSegNet Dice score outperforms manual raters on VAT (0.850 vs. 0.788) and produces comparable results on SAT (0.975 vs. 0.982). The pipeline has excellent agreement for both test-retest (ICC VAT 0.998 and SAT 0.996) and manual re-editing (ICC VAT 0.999 and SAT 0.999). Conclusions FatSegNet generalizes well to different body shapes, sensitively replicates known VAT and SAT volume effects in a large cohort study and permits localized analysis of fat compartments. Furthermore, it can reliably analyze a 3D Dixon MRI in similar to 1 minute, providing an efficient and validated pipeline for abdominal adipose tissue analysis in the Rhineland Study.","deep learning,dixon MRI,neural networks,semantic segmentation,subcutaneous adipose tissue,visceral adipose tissue",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"BODY-FAT,QUANTIFICATION,AGE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02082,

Radiomics literature about BAP1 mutation lacks papers that consider the reliability of texture features in their workflow. Purpose Using texture features with a high inter-observer agreement, we aimed to develop and internally validate a machine learning-based radiomic model for predicting the BAP1 mutation status of ccRCCs. Material and Methods For this retrospective study, 65 ccRCCs were included from a public database. Texture features were extracted from unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images, using two-dimensional manual segmentation. Dimension reduction was done in three steps: (i) inter-observer agreement analysis; (ii) collinearity analysis; and (iii) feature selection. The machine learning classifier was random forest. The model was validated using 10-fold nested cross-validation. The reference standard was the BAP1 mutation status. Results Out of 744 features, 468 had an excellent inter-observer agreement. After the collinearity analysis, the number of features decreased to 17. Finally, the wrapper-based algorithm selected six features. Using selected features, the random forest correctly classified 84.6% of the labelled slices regarding BAP1 mutation status with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.897. For predicting ccRCCs with BAP1 mutation, the sensitivity, specificity, and precision were 90.4%, 78.8%, and 81%, respectively. For predicting ccRCCs without BAP1 mutation, the sensitivity, specificity, and precision were 78.8%, 90.4%, and 89.1%, respectively. Conclusion Machine learning-based unenhanced CT texture analysis might be a potential method for predicting the BAP1 mutation status of ccRCCs.","Artificial intelligence,machine learning,radiogenomics,radiomics,texture analysis,clear cell renal cell carcinoma",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"PBRM1,SELECTION,RADIOGENOMICS,SETD2,BIAS,VHL",ACTA RADIOLOGICA,,

Materials and methods Preoperative magnetic resonance images were retrospectively obtained from 239 patients with diffuse gliomas (World Health Organization grades II-IV). The patients were randomly assigned to a training group (n = 160) or a validation group (n = 79) at a 2:1 ratio. For each patient, a total of 431 radiomic features were extracted. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm was used for feature selection. A machine-learning model for predicting VEGF status was then developed using the selected features and a support vector machine classifier. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated in both groups using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and correlations between selected features were assessed. Results Nine radiomic features were selected to generate a VEGF-associated radiomic signature of diffuse gliomas based on the mRMR algorithm. This radiomic signature consisted of two first-order statistics or related wavelet features (Entropy and Minimum) and seven textural features or related wavelet features (including Cluster Tendency and Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis). The predictive efficiencies measured by the area under the curve were 74.1% in the training group and 70.2% in the validation group. The overall correlations between the 9 radiomic features were low in both groups. Conclusions Radiomic analysis facilitated efficient prediction of VEGF status in diffuse gliomas, suggesting that using tumor-derived radiomic features for predicting genomic information is feasible.","Vascular endothelial growth factor,Diffuse gliomas,Radiomic analysis,Machine learning",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Oncology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.849,"CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM,FACTOR,EXPRESSION,RADIOMIC,FEATURES,GRADE,GLIOMAS,TUMORS,BRAIN,ASSOCIATIONS,MUTATIONS,SURVIVAL,TEXTURE",CANCER IMAGING,https://cancerimagingjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40644-019-0256-y,

EMG signals measure the electrical activity muscular systems, which involved in physical action of human. EMG signals provide more information related to physical action. In this paper, we proposed deep transfer learning-based approach of human action classification using surface EMG signals. The surface EMG signals are represented by time-frequency image (TFI) by using short-time Fourier transform. TFI is used as input to pre-trained convolutional neural network models, namely AlexNet and VGG16, for deep feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for classification of physical action of EMG signals. Also, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained AlexNet model is also considered. The experimental results show that deep feature extraction and SVM classification method and fine-tuning have obviously improved the classification accuracy when compared with various results from the literature. The 99.04% accuracy score is obtained with AlexNet fc6 + AlexNet fc7 + VGG16 fc6 + VGG16 fc7 deep feature concatenation and SVM classification. 98.65% accuracy score is performed by fine-tuning of the AlexNet model. We also compare the obtained results with some of the existing methods.

Recently, increasingly more research efforts have been put into the structural health monitoring domain. In this work, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network, namely SHMnet, for a challenging structural condition identification case, that is, steel frame with bolted connection damage. We perform systematic studies on the optimisation of network architecture and the preparation of the training data. In the laboratory, repeated impact hammer tests are conducted on a steel frame with different bolted connection damage scenarios, as small as one bolt loosened. The time-domain monitoring data from a single accelerometer are used for training. We conduct parametric studies on different layer numbers, different sensor locations, the quantity of the training datasets and noise levels. The results show that the proposed SHMnet is effective and reliable with at least four independent training datasets and by avoiding vibration node points as sensor locations. Under up to 60% additive Gaussian noise, the average identification accuracy is over 98%. In comparison, the traditional methods based on the identified modal parameters inevitably fail due to the unnoticeable changes of identified natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results provide confidence in using the developed method as an effective structural condition identification framework. It has the potential to transform the structural health monitoring practice.

However, the problem with such methods is that their accuracy is not high. Therefore, this paper proposes a respiratory monitoring method based on a BP neural network combined with multisensor fusion technology. First, we fix multiple sensors on the chest and back of the human body so that we can accurately measure the acceleration and angular velocity changes caused by the contraction and expansion of the chest contour when athletes breathe under different motion conditions. After a coordinate measurement is performed on the data measured by the back measurement unit, the BP network algorithm is used to obtain the acceleration curve under the simple respiratory motion state. Finally, the respiratory frequency and respiratory depth parameters, which are important indicators for evaluating athletes' physical fitness, can be obtained for the athletes under different motion states. Verification was carried out in an experimental platform, and the experimental results for different postures of the human body were compared with the standard respiratory mask measurement results. The accuracy rate was over 90%, thus realizing the networking, portability, and wearability of the breathing state sensors, which provide real-time accurate measurements.","BP neural network,Respiratory monitoring,Wearability",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.344,,JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,,

Physics-based (or empirical-phenomenological) and data-driven methods have been proposed in the literature to solve damage diagnosis and prognosis challenges. Among data-driven methods, neural networks have often successfully proven their regression capabilities for the complex, nonlinear problems typical of this field research field. Indeed, the need to resort to machine learning techniques (e.g., neural networks) becomes stronger when physics-based (or empirical-phenomenological) models are lacking for describing the degradation behavior of the systems under consideration. In this work, we propose to exploit the flexibility offered by neural networks in order to adaptively, and in real time, learn from the monitored structure and derive models for diagnosis and prognosis of structural components subject to damage processes. To this aim, neural networks are embedded within a particle filtering scheme, and the training of the network is performed sequentially and in real time, as observations become available during the damage evolution. The structural health monitoring tool is capable of sequentially updating itself using the observations gathered during the system's operation, avoiding the typical limitations associated to off-line training schemes, which are, in general, not capable of capturing possible changes in the dynamical degradation behavior, when not properly included in the training patterns. For validation and comparison purposes, the method is demonstrated on simulated fatigue crack growths and real crack evolution dynamics observed in a metallic aeronautical panel loaded with a changing-amplitude fatigue load, during an accelerated laboratory test.","adaptive diagnostic and prognostic,neural networks,particle filtering,remaining useful life",Article,"JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD, THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,,"HEALTH,MONITORING,DATA,MONTE-CARLO,METHODS,LIFE,PARAMETER",STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING,,

The demand for new materials that suit specific applications is increasing. However, the development time of new materials from new molecular structures can take 10-20 years. For this reason, both the knowledge about the structure-property relationship and the creation of reliable databases are increasingly crucial, as they serve to generate predictive models with the aim of reducing development times. This challenge is attempted by polymer informatics. In the present work, we show results of in silico experimentation, using in-house databases, with the aim of generating Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) models to predict a property derived from the tensile test Tensile Modulus. Two models were reported, after several development stages: feature selection, QSPR modelling training and validation. Additionally, complete physicochemical discussions and interpretations were presented. The QSPR model could be used as a ""virtual testing"" that provides a property profile estimation for a new molecule before synthesis.

With the advancement of technology, laboratories have become equipped with various spectrometers. By fusing output from different spectrometers, better prediction outcomes are expected than using any single spectrometer alone. In this study, model performance from a single spectrometer (visible-near-infrared spectroscopy, vis-NIR or mid infrared spectroscopy, MIR) was compared to the combined spectrometers (vis-NIR and MIR). We selected a total of 14,594 samples from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database that had both vis-NIR and MIR spectra along with measurements of sand, clay, total C (TC) content, organic C (OC) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH. The dataset was randomly split into 75% training (n = 10,946) and the remaining (n = 3,648) as a test set. Prediction models were constructed with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Cubist tree model. Additionally, we explored the use of a deep learning model, the convolutional neural network (CNN). We investigated various ways to feed spectral data to the CNN, either as one-dimensional (1D) data (as a spectrum) or as two-dimensional (2D) data (as a spectrogram). Compared to the PLSR model, we found that the CNN model provides an average improvement prediction of 33-42% using vis-NIR and 30-43% using MIR spectral data input. The relative accuracy improvement of CNN, when compared to the Cubist regression tree model, ranged between 22 and 36% with vis-NIR and 16-27% with MIR spectral data input. Various methods to fuse the vis-NIR and MIR spectral data were explored. We compared the performance of spectral concatenation (for PLSR and Cubist model), two-channel input method, and outer product analysis (OPA) method (for CNN model). We found that the performance of two-channel 1D CNN model was the best (R-2 = 0.95-0.98) followed closely by the OPA with CNN (R-2 = 0.93-0.98), Cubist model with spectral concatenation (R-2 = 0.91-0.97), two-channel 2D CNN model (R-2 = 0.90-0.95) and PLSR with spectral concatenation (R-2 = 0.87-0.95). Chemometric analysis of spectroscopy data relied on spectral pre-processing methods: such as spectral trimming, baseline correction, smoothing, and normalization before being fed into the model. CNN achieved higher performance than the PLSR and Cubist model without utilizing the pre-processed spectral data. We also found that the predictions using the CNN model retained similar correlations to the actual values in comparison to other models. By doing sensitivity analysis, we identified the important spectral wavelengths variables used by the CNN model to predict various soil properties. CNN is an effective model for modelling soil properties from a large spectral library.","Deep learning,Multi-task learning,Near-infrared spectroscopy,Mid-infrared spectroscopy",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"OUTER-PRODUCT,ANALYSIS,REFLECTANCE,SPECTROSCOPY,ANALYSIS,OPA,NIR,CARBON,COMPONENTS,LIBRARIES,QUALITY,FUSION",GEODERMA,,

It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.","Algorithms,Covariates,Digital soil mapping,Soil organic carbon,Systematic mapping,Validation",Review,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"NEW-SOUTH-WALES,GEOGRAPHICALLY,WEIGHTED,REGRESSION,BASE-LINE,MAP,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SPATIAL,PREDICTION,LAND-USE,RANDOM,FOREST,CLIMATE-CHANGE,REGIONAL-SCALE,TERRAIN,ATTRIBUTES",GEODERMA,,

Although recently, some attempts have been made to incorporate physical features in the ML process, its effects have not been demonstrated and systematically analysed nor experimentally validated with prototype alloys. To address this issue, a physical metallurgy (PM) -guided ML model was developed, wherein intermediate parameters were generated based on original inputs and PM principles, e.g., equilibrium volume fraction (V-f) and driving force (D-f) for precipitation, and these were added to the original dataset vectors as extra dimensions to participate in and guide the ML process. As a result, the ML process becomes more robust when dealing with small datasets by improving the data quality and enriching data information. Therefore, a new material design method is proposed combining PM-guided ML regression, ML classifier and a genetic algorithm (GA). The model was successfully applied to the design of advanced ultrahigh-strength stainless steels using only a small database extracted from the literature. The proposed prototype alloy with a leaner chemistry but better mechanical properties has been produced experimentally and an excellent agreement was obtained for the predicted optimal parameter settings and the final properties. In addition, the present work also clearly demonstrated that implementation of PM parameters can improve the design accuracy and efficiency by eliminating intermediate solutions not obeying PM principles in the ML process. Furthermore, various important factors influencing the generalizability of the ML model are discussed in detail. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, according to the orthogonal design of experiments, the numerical simulation analysis of the springback for the 3D stretch-bending aluminum profile is carried out by the ABAQUS finite element software. And to investigate the effect of material properties on the springback, the range analysis of the orthogonal experiment is performed. The results show that these material properties of the aluminum profile (elastic modulus E, yield strength sigma(y), and tangent modulus E-1) might have the biggest influence on the springback of the aluminum profile, and the optimized forming parameters are founded as follows: the horizontal bending degree is 14 degrees, the vertical bending degree is 14 degrees, the number of multipoint stretch-bending dies is 10, the friction coefficient is 0.15, and aluminum alloy grade is 6063. Moreover, the model of the BP neural network for the prediction of the springback is established and trained based on the orthogonal experiment, and the results with the BP neural network model are in good agreement with experimental results.

While VARMs postulate that a given region of interest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that directed dependencies arise clue to instantaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are not necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary perspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that leverage both instantaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put forth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they are incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series. To this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably broaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels, which have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in canonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here to the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient regularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to real-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected dictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach. Numerical tests on ECoG data captured through a study on epileptic seizures demonstrate that it is possible to unveil previously unknown directed links between brain regions of interest.","Network topology inference,structural vector autoregressive models,nonlinear models",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,,"GRANGER,CAUSALITY,CORTICAL,INTERACTIONS,EQUATION,MODELS,CONNECTIVITY,TOPOLOGY,FMRI",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6779157,

Firstly, different degradation models are utilized to estimate the degradation indexes such as average radius of Pt particles, electrochemical surface area, and membrane thickness. A multi-sale hybrid degradation index is then designed to fuse all the previous indexes based on the quantified effects of electrode and membrane degradation. Finally, based on the automatic machine learning algorithm and the aging experimental data of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the proposed hybrid degradation index is verified.

PML is well suited for applications where a wireless tracking is crucial, and in particular for tongue motion which opens up many new interesting applications. To allow its usage outside of a research lab, our tongue tracking system relies on the PML to avoid impeding tongue's natural motion due to its wireless tracking method and ensure safe use inside the mouth. Our tracking module is embedded in a headset to be portable and simple to use while being affordable by relying on the mass-produced components. The classical implementation of PML has many shortcomings that limit its practicality for real-world applications because it is computationally intensive due to its iterative algorithm, subject to local minimum convergence issues, and sensitive to its initial state and calibration parameters. Additionally, its physical model is an approximation that is only valid in limited tracking conditions. In this paper, we investigated the potential of deep learning to create a PML model for tongue tracking by training a feedforward neural network (3 layers, 100 neurons per layer) on a dataset composed of similar to 17 million states spanning a volume of 10 x 10 x 10 cm(3). Our PML was validated on 337000 states in a 4 x 6 x 7 cm(3) volume and tested on 100000 samples emulating a more natural tongue motion with curves and twists. A fully automated SD positional stage was engineered by our team to collect these large datasets of the 5D magnet states. Our PML prediction, limited to the magnet's 3D positions in this paper, reaches positional errors of 1.4 mm (median) and 1.8 mm (Q3).","Algorithm,articulograph,biomedical device,deep learning,machine learning,magnetometers,motion tracking,neural network,nonlinear optimization,permanent magnet localization,speech,tongue tracking,wearable",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"ELECTROMAGNETIC,ARTICULOGRAPHY,SPEECH,RECOGNITION,ALGORITHM,POSITION,ELECTROPALATOGRAPHY,MOVEMENTS,ACCURACY,POINTS,ADULTS",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,,

Secondly, we use Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to achieve precise matching of feature points. Then, according to the transformation parameters obtained by RANSAC algorithm, we perform spatial transformation on the floating image to complete the registration. Finally, we obtain the low-frequency sub-band and high-frequency sub-band of the image to be fused by NSCT decomposition. The low-frequency sub-band is fused by the regional energy. The high-frequency sub-bands are studied using a simplified-PCNN model and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

Indeed, understanding the fundamental aspects of oxygen diffusion is important to develop new materials for this application. In this work, Nd(1-x)AE(x)BaInO(4-x/2) (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds have been studied by MD simulations focusing on oxygen diffusion mechanisms. Two general clustering methods were used, namely a convex hull classification method and a DBSCAN machine learning algorithm, to identify oxygen ion diffusion pathways. Here, relevant details are provided for an efficient use of these two approaches during MD analysis of ion conductors. The calculations show that Ca is the most favorable dopant for substituting Nd in NdBaInO4, while Ba is the least desired. Indeed, the substitution of Nd by Ca hardly changes the pristine lattice parameters of NdBaInO4 and leads to the highest oxygen diffusion coefficient compared to other dopants. The oxygen vacancies induced by doping mainly locate on two specific oxygen sites over four oxygen sites available. Concerning the diffusion process, jumps involving these two sites play the main role and are associated with smaller migration enthalpies. For the main diffusion path, ions migrate along the b (2 routes) and c (4 routes) directions. Some other oxygen sites can be considered as barriers for the diffusion process inducing a strong anisotropy in the diffusion process. Additionally, the residence time analysis of oxygen ions confirms that ions at different sites have different motion abilities. As a whole, the approach presented here can be extrapolated to other ion conductors for gaining detailed information about the diffusion process.","OXIDE-ION CONDUCTIVITY,PEROVSKITE-RELATED STRUCTURE,LAYERED PEROVSKITES,VACANCY MIGRATION,SURFACE EXCHANGE,SIMULATIONS,TRANSPORT,DEFECT,REPRESENTATION,ELECTROLYTES",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,3.802,"OXIDE-ION,CONDUCTIVITY,PEROVSKITE-RELATED,STRUCTURE,LAYERED,PEROVSKITES,VACANCY,MIGRATION,SURFACE,EXCHANGE,SIMULATIONS,TRANSPORT,DEFECT,REPRESENTATION,ELECTROLYTES",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

At present, the utility of biological signals in the area of security became popular. ECG signal is getting wide attention to use it as a tool for biometric recognition in authentication applications. ECG signals can provide more accurate biometrics for personal identity recognition. In machine learning, over-fitting is one of the major problems when working with a large data set of features so that an effective statistical technique is needed to control it. In this research, ECG signals are acquired from 20 individuals over 6 months in the MIT-BIH ECG-ID database. Altogether, a high-dimensional (N = 72) set of ECG features are extracted. These features are further fed to an algorithm, which reduces the feature space by classifying vital features and avoiding random, correlated and over-fitted features to increase the prediction accuracy.

In this field, machine learning techniques play a key role. However, the amount of health data acquired from digital machines has high dimensionality and not all data acquired from digital machines are relevant for a particular disease. Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome including several specific diseases, and it is a good model to implement machine learning analyses. In this work, we applied five feature selection algorithms to identify the set of relevant features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images of the main areas affected by PPA from patient records. On the other hand, we carried out classification and clustering algorithms before and after the feature selection process to contrast both results with those obtained in a previous work. We aimed to find the best classifier and the more relevant features from the WEKA tool to propose further a framework for automatic help on diagnosis. Dataset contains data from 150 FDG-PET imaging studies of 91 patients with a clinic prognosis of PPA, which were examined twice, and 28 controls. Our method comprises six different stages: (i) feature extraction, (ii) expertise knowledge supervision (iii) classification process, (iv) comparing classification results for feature selection, (v) clustering process after feature selection, and (vi) comparing clustering results with those obtained in a previous work.
Results: Experimental tests confirmed clustering results from a previous work. Although classification results for some algorithms are not decisive for reducing features precisely, Principal Components Analisys (PCA) results exhibited similar or even better performances when compared to those obtained with all features.
Conclusions: Although reducing the dimensionality does not means a general improvement, the set of features is almost halved and results are better or quite similar. Finally, it is interesting how these results expose a finer grain classification of patients according to the neuroanatomy of their disease.","Supervised algorithm,Unsupervised algorithm,Clustering Analysis",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"PRIMARY,PROGRESSIVE,APHASIA,FDG-PET,APRAXIA,TIME",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6788103?pdf=render,

Nevertheless, during the design process of piles, due to the intrinsic complexity as well as various design variables, the internal stress state related to pile drivability remains unclear, which makes the analysis imprecise. Thus, the development of an accurate predictive model becomes emergent. This paper presents a practical approach to assess pile drivability in relation to the prediction of Maximum compressive stresses and Blow per foot using a series of machine learning algorithms. A database of more than 4000 piles is employed to construct random forest regression (RFR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. The 10-fold cross-validation method and Lasso regularisation are adapted to obtain the model of superior generalisation ability and better persuasive results. Lastly, the results of RFR and MARS models were compared and evaluated in accordance with the goodness of fit, running time and interpretability. The results show that the RFR model performs better than the MARS in terms of fitting and operational efficiency, but is short of interpretability.","Random forest regression,multivariate adaptive regression splines,pile drivability,cross-validation,Lasso regularisation",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Geology",,3.14,"MODEL,SELECTION,PREDICTION,CAPACITY",GEORISK-ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK FOR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND GEOHAZARDS,,

An extended-wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (EWDRS) technique was evaluated for its ability to differentiate between and classify different skin and tissue types in an in vivo pig model.
Materials and methods
EWDRS recordings (450-1550 nm) were made on skin with different degrees of pigmentation as well as on the pig snout and tongue. The recordings were used to train a support vector machine to identify and classify the different skin and tissue types.
Results
The resulting EWDRS curves for each skin and tissue type had a unique profile. The support vector machine was able to classify each skin and tissue type with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. The sensitivity and specificity were between 96.4 and 100.0% for all skin and tissue types.
Conclusion
EWDRS can be used in vivo to differentiate between different skin and tissue types with good accuracy. Further development of the technique may potentially lead to a novel diagnostic tool for e.g. non-invasive tumor margin delineation.","DIAGNOSIS,METAANALYSIS,DERMOSCOPY,MELANOMA",Article,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE, 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"DIAGNOSIS,METAANALYSIS,DERMOSCOPY,MELANOMA",PLOS ONE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6786558?pdf=render,

In OAR segmentation of the head and neck computed tomography (CT), the low-contrast and surrounding adhesion tissues of the parotids, thyroids, and optic nerves result in the difficulty in segmentation and lower accuracy of automatic segmentation for these organs than the other organs. In this paper, we propose a cascaded network structure to delineate these three OARs for NPC radiotherapy by combining deep learning and Boosting algorithm. Materials and methods The CT images of 140 NPC patients treated with radiotherapy were collected, and each of the three OAR annotations was respectively delineated by an experienced rater and reviewed by a professional radiologist (with 10 yr of experience). The datasets (140 patients) were divided into a training set (100 patients), a validation set (20 patients), and a test set (20 patients). From the Boosting method for combining multiple classifiers, three cascaded CNNs for segmentation were combined. The first network was trained with the traditional approach. The second one was trained on patterns (pixels) filtered by the first net. That is, the second machine recognized a mix of patterns (pixels), 50% of which was accurately identified by the first net. Finally, the third net was trained on the new patterns (pixels) screened jointly by the first and second networks. During the test, the outputs of the three nets were considered to obtain the final output. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (95% HD), and volume overlap error (VOE) were used to assess the method performance. Results The mean DSC (%) values were above 92.26 for the parotids, above 92.29 for the thyroids, and above 89.37 for the optic nerves. The mean 95% HDs (mm) were approximately 3.08 for the parotids, 2.64 for the thyroids, and 2.03 for the optic nerves. The mean VOE (%) values were approximately 14.16 for the parotids, 14.94 for the thyroids, and 19.07 for the optic nerves. Conclusion The proposed cascaded deep learning structure could achieve high performance compared with existing single-network or other segmentation algorithms.","boosting,deep learning,nasopharyngeal carcinoma,organs-at-risk,segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"PAROTID-GLAND,INJURY,HEAD,RADIOTHERAPY,IMAGES,VALIDATION,ALGORITHM,MR",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Because of the nonlinear correlation between the dose distribution and the activity distribution of positron emitters in addition to the presence of noise, machine learning approaches were proposed to establish their relationship. Materials/methods Simulations were carried out with a spot-scanning proton system using GATE-8.0 and Geant4-10.3 toolkit with a computed tomography (CT)-based patient phantom. The one-dimensional (1D) distributions of positron emitters and radiation dose were obtained. A feedforward neural network classification model comprising two hidden layers, was developed to estimate whether the range is within a preset threshold. A recurrent neural network (RNN) regression model comprising three layers and ten neurons in each hidden layer was developed to estimate dose distribution. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Results The feasibility of proton range and dose verification using the proposed neural network framework was demonstrated. The feedforward NN model achieves high classification accuracy close to 100% for individual classes without bias. The RNN model is able to accurately predict the 1D dose distribution for different energies and irradiation positions. When the SNR of the input activity profiles is above 4, the framework is able to predict with an MAE of 0.60 mm and an MSE of 0.066. Moreover, the model demonstrates a good capability of generalization. Conclusion The RNN model is found to be effective in identifying the relationship between the distributions of dose and positron emitters. The machine learning-based framework and RNN models may be a useful tool to allow for accurate online range and dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters.","dose verification,positron emitters,proton therapy,range verification,recurrent neural network",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"IN-BEAM,PET,PROMPT-GAMMA,VIVO,VERIFICATION,DELIVERY,PATIENT,SYSTEM,CAMERA,DISTRIBUTIONS,SIMULATION,NUCLEI",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,
82,Towards a mix design model for the prediction of permeability of hot-mix asphalt,221,,637-642,"Blaauw Sheldon A.,Maina James W.,Horak Emile","Blaauw SA,Maina JW,Horak E",Maina JW,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.082,University of Pretoria,"Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) is a designed pre-mix of graded aggregates and bituminous-based binder, hot applied on road pavements to provide a smooth and safe riding surface and protect the underlying layers. Current HMA mix design methods are focusing, mostly, on the strength of the mixture. However, the mixture permeability, which is an equally important performance parameter of an HMA layer - strongly influencing the durability of the HMA and underlying layers - is not always pertinently used as a mix design parameter. Exclusion of permeability is attributed to uncertainty on the accuracy of measured permeability, as well as poor correlation among predicted, field, and laboratory results. In this paper, it is hypothesised that practical and reliable methods are available to predict and measure the permeability of HMA in the field and laboratory as well as to successfully relate permeability parameters to long-term performance of HMA. The objective of the study is to establish these relationships and validate an HMA design model to predict durability. Numerous theoretical models were evaluated and the selected model is based on regression analysis of field data. Initially, predominant variables influencing layer permeability were found to be void proportion, binder content as well as aggregate grading and packing. Subsequently, regression analyses of data showed that within reasonable variation of the other variables, layer permeability is strongly correlated to aggregate grading and packing, as described by rational Bailey ratios, hence the focus of refining the model on the latter parameters. The research confirmed the hypothesis by showing an acceptable level of confidence in the relationships. The study objective was achieved to the extent that the predicted levels of permeability correlated well with field observations of durability performance. This was enhanced with machine learning modelling of the data sets available from recent as-built road sections with similar design and specifications and different permeability observations in the field. It is concluded that permeability can indeed be introduced as a primary design objective in HMA design practice. It is recommended that, while further machine learning refinement is being done, the model be used by designers in enhancing the prediction of design life of HMA surfacing and structural pavement layers.

The progressive nature of this disease makes it inevitable to detect this disease in its early stages, leads to a greater demand for developing non-obstructive and reliable technology for COPD detection. The use of highly patient-effort dependent, time-consuming, and expensive methods are some major inherent limitations of previous techniques. Lack of knowledge about the disease and inadequacy of proper diagnostic tool for early detection of COPD is another reason behind the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. For this reason, this study aims to explore the utility of ECG Derived Respiration (EDR) for classification between COPD patients and normal healthy subjects as EDR can be easily extracted from ECG. ECG and respiration signals collected from 30 normal and 30 COPD subjects were analysed. Error calculation and statistical analysis were performed to observe the similarity between original respiration and EDR signal. The morphological pattern changes of respiration and EDR signals were analysed and three different features were extracted from those. Classification was performed by different classifiers employing Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Apart from obtaining comparable classification performance it was seen that EDR has better potential than the original respiration signal for classification of COPD from normal population.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Electrocardiogram,ECG derived respiration,Respiration,Classification",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Engineering,,,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,OBSTRUCTIVE,PULMONARY-DISEASE,VOLATILE,ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,HEALTHY,DIAGNOSIS",AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE,,

High-throughput electronic structure theory may help to explore the vast chemical space available and offers a design tool to the experimental synthesis. This method efficiently predicts the elementary magnetic properties of a compound and its thermodynamical stability, but it is blind to information concerning the magnetic critical temperature. Here we introduce a range of machine-learning models to predict the Curie temperature T-C of ferromagnets. The models are constructed by using experimental data for about 2500 known magnets and consider the chemical composition of a compound as the only feature determining T-C. Thus we are able to establish a one-to-one relation between the chemical composition and the critical temperature. We show that the best model can predict T-C's with an accuracy of about 50 K. Most importantly our model is able to make predictions in regions of the chemical space, where only a small fraction of the data was considered for training. Furthermore, it is able to assess the uncertainty of such predictions. This is demonstrated by tracing the T-C of binary intermetallic alloys along their composition space and for the Al-Co-Fe ternary system.","MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES,RARE-EARTH,ALLOYS,COBALT,MODELS,NICKEL",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",Materials Science,,4.034,"MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES,RARE-EARTH,ALLOYS,COBALT,MODELS,NICKEL",PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS,http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/91539/1/Predicting%20the%20Curie.pdf,

The objective of this work is to monitor porosity in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing of nickel alloy 718 (popularly called Inconel 718) test parts using in-process optical emission spectroscopy. To realize this objective, cylinder-shaped test parts are built under different processing conditions on a commercial L-PBF machine instrumented with an in-situ multispectral photodetector sensor. Optical emission signatures are captured continuously during the build by the multispectral sensor. Following processing, the porosity-level within each layer of a test part is quantified using X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). The graph Fourier transform coefficients are derived layer-by-layer from signatures acquired from the multispectral photodetector sensor. These graph Fourier transform coefficients are subsequently invoked as input features within various machine learning models to predict the percentage porosity-level in each layer with CT data taken as ground truth. This approach is found to predict the porosity on a layer-by-layer basis with an accuracy of similar to 90% (F-score) in a computation time less than 0.5 seconds.

Through the input weight analysis, it was found that the sulfide concentration had the greatest influence on the polarization curve, followed by the chloride ion concentration, and the temperature influence was the smallest. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, sulfide and temperature had a large effect, while chloride ions had little effect. The result of the weight analysis was consistent with traditional electrochemical results.","copper,electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,machine learning,polarization curve",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,1.908,"COPPER,CORROSION,RANDOM,FOREST",MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION,,

Due to its variability and susceptibility, patients may be at risk at any time. The rapid and accurate classification of PVC is of great significance for the treatment of diseases. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a method based on the combination of features and random forest to identify PVC. The RR intervals (pre_RR and post_RR), R amplitude, and QRS area are chosen as the features because they are able to identify PVC better. The experiment was validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and achieved good results.

Various machine learning methods are often employed to screen large libraries of compounds and predict the activities of new substances by training the molecular structure-activity relationships. One such method is graph classification, in which a molecular structure can be represented in terms of a labeled graph with nodes that correspond to atoms and edges that correspond to the bonds between these atoms. In a conventional graph definition, atomic symbols and bond orders are employed as node and edge labels, respectively. In this study, we developed new graph definitions using the assignment of atom and bond types in the force fields of molecular dynamics methods as node and edge labels, respectively. We found that these graph definitions improved the accuracies of activity classifications for chemical substances using graph kernels with support vector machines and deep neural networks. The higher accuracies obtained using our proposed definitions can enhance the development of the materials informatics using graph-based machine learning methods.","Machine learning,Force field,Graph kernel,Support vector machine,Deep neural network",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,2.723,"KERNELS,QSAR,VALIDATION,REGRESSION,PROTEINS,MODEL",MOLECULAR INFORMATICS,,

However, no simple and reliable prediction model has been identified. Here, we aimed to develop and validate predictive models for the MTX response to JIA using machine learning based on electronic medical record (EMR) before and after administering MTX.
Materials and Methods: Data of 362 JIA patients with MTX mono-therapy were retrospectively collected from EMR between January 2008 and October 2018. DAS44/ESR-3 simplified standard was used to evaluate the MTX response. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) algorithms were applied to develop and validate models with 5-fold cross-validation on the randomly split training and test set. Data of 13 patients additionally collected were used for external validation.
Results: The XGBoost screened out the optimal 10 pre-administration features and 6 mix-variables. The XGBoost established the best model based on the 10 pre-administration variables. The performances were accuracy 91.78%, sensitivity 90.70%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 97.00%, respectively. Similarly, the XGBoost developed a better model based on the 6 mix-variables, whose performances were accuracy 94.52%, sensitivity 95.35%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 99.00%, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on common EMR data, we developed two MTX response predictive models with excellent performance in JIA using machine learning. These models can predict the MTX efficacy early and accurately, which provides powerful decision support for doctors to make or adjust therapeutic scheme before or after treatment.","methotrexate,juvenile idiopathic arthritis,prediction model,machine learning,clinical response",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,6.006,"RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS,DISEASE-ACTIVITY,PATHWAY,GENES,POLYMORPHISMS,EFFICACY,CLASSIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION,TOXICITY,ADHESION,COHORT",FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.01155,

Code-multiplexing of Coulter sensors allows such integration to be implemented with simple hardware but requires advanced signal processing to extract multi-dimensional information from the output waveform. In this work, we couple deep learning-based signal analysis with microfluidic code-multiplexed Coulter sensor networks. Specifically, we train convolutional neural networks to analyze Coulter waveforms not only to recognize certain sensor waveform patterns but also to resolve interferences among them. Our technology predicts the size, speed, and location of each detected particle. We show that the algorithm yields a >90% pattern recognition accuracy for distinguishing non-correlated waveform patterns at a processing speed that can potentially enable real-time microfluidic assays. Furthermore, once trained, the algorithm can readily be applied for processing electrical data from other microfluidic devices integrated with the same Coulter sensor network.","ELECTRODE NETWORKS,PARTICLES,COUNTER,SEQUENCES,NANOPORE",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Instruments & Instrumentation",,7.379,"ELECTRODE,NETWORKS,PARTICLES,COUNTER,SEQUENCES,NANOPORE",LAB ON A CHIP,,

These interesting far- and near-field optical characteristics of the plasmonic NPs can be typically obtained from numerical simulations for theoretical guidance of NP design. However, traditional numerical simulations encounter irreconcilable conflicts between the accuracy and speed due to the high demand of computing power. In this work, we utilized the machine learning method, specifically the deep neural network (DNN), to establish mapping between the far-field spectra/near-field distribution and dimensional parameters of three types of plasmonic NPs including nanospheres, nanorods, and dimers. After the training process, both the forward prediction of far-field optical properties and the inverse prediction of on-demand dimensional parameters of NPs can be accomplished accurately and efficiently with the DNN. More importantly, we have achieved for the first time ultrafast and accurate prediction of two-dimensional on-resonance electromagnetic enhancement distributions around NPs by greatly reducing the amount of electromagnetic data via screening and resampling methods. These near-field predictions can be realized typically in less than 10(-2) seconds on a laptop, which is 6 orders faster than typical numerical simulations implemented on a server. Therefore, we demonstrate that the DNN is an ultrafast, highly efficient, and computing resource-saving tool to investigate the far- and near-field optical properties of plasmonic NPs, especially for a number of important nano-optical applications such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, solar cells, and metamaterials.","DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS,ENHANCED RAMAN TAGS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,NANOSTRUCTURES,CLASSIFICATION,FLUORESCENCE,SCATTERING,CONVERSION",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,7.632,"DEEP,NEURAL-NETWORKS,ENHANCED,RAMAN,TAGS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,NANOSTRUCTURES,CLASSIFICATION,FLUORESCENCE,SCATTERING,CONVERSION",NANOSCALE,,
