1,Gout Diagnosis Model Based on Neighborhood Cost Sensitive Three-Way Decision,56,16,218-225,",,","Zhang Meng,Sun Bingzhen,Chu Xiaoli",,,Zhang Meng,"The three-way decision-making is based on cost sensitivity. By introducing delayed decision-making, the classification can be more reasonable under the condition of incomplete information. In this paper, the optimization decision problem of decision information system with mixed attribute characteristics is considered. The neighborhood relationship is defined on the mixed attribute information system, and the decision rough set model based on neighborhood relation is constructed. On this basis, it is applied to the decision-making problem of gout clinical diagnosis, and the gout data are classified by iterative learning. Compared with SVM(Support Vector Machine), RF(Random Forest), LR(Logistic Regression) classification algorithms, the superiority of this method is proved. Finally, according to the classification results, this paper finds the internal relationship between the factors, obtains the classification rules, and explores the correlation between gout and liver function, kidney function, blood fat and blood sugar, so as to provide knowledge support and decision support for the cause research, diagnosis and treatment of gout.",cost sensitivity; three-way decision; neighborhood; big data medical treatment,Article,,,,,,,,
2,Predicting target genes of non-coding regulatory variants with IRT,36,16,4440-4448,"Wu Zhenqin,Ioannidis Nilah M.,Zou James","Wu ZQ,Ioannidis NM,Zou J",Ioannidis NM; Zou J,10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa254,Stanford University,"Interpreting genetic variants of unknown significance (VUS) is essential in clinical applications of genome sequencing for diagnosis and personalized care. Non-coding variants remain particularly difficult to interpret, despite making up a large majority of trait associations identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analyses. Predicting the regulatory effects of non-coding variants on candidate genes is a key step in evaluating their clinical significance. Here, we develop a machine-learning algorithm, Inference of Connected expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (IRT), to predict the regulatory targets of non-coding variants identified in studies of eQTLs. We assemble datasets using eQTL results from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and learn to separate positive and negative pairs based on annotations characterizing the variant, gene and the intermediate sequence. IRT achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.799 using random cross-validation, and 0.700 for a more stringent position-based cross-validation. Further evaluation on rare variants and experimentally validated regulatory variants shows a significant enrichment in IRT identifying the true target genes versus negative controls. In gene-ranking experiments, IRT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 50% and top-3 accuracy of 90%. Salient features, including GC-content, histone modifications and Hi-C interactions are further analyzed and visualized to illustrate their influences on predictions. IRT can be applied to any VUS of interest and each candidate nearby gene to output a score reflecting the likelihood of regulatory effect on the expression level. These scores can be used to prioritize variants and genes to assist in patient diagnosis and GWAS follow-up studies.","GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION,HUMAN PIGMENTATION,EXPRESSION,ANNOTATION,IRF4,MC1R,IDENTIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,IMPACT,LOCI",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematics",,8.47,"GENOME-WIDE,ASSOCIATION,HUMAN,PIGMENTATION,EXPRESSION,ANNOTATION,IRF4,MC1R,IDENTIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,IMPACT,LOCI",BIOINFORMATICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7575052,

We assessed the relative contributions of shape and texture metrics separately and together in the prediction model. Materials and methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 735 patients with 539 malignant and 196 benign masses were segmented in this retrospective study. Thirty-three shape and 760 texture metrics were calculated per tumor. Tumor classification models using shape, texture, and both metrics were built using random forest and AdaBoost with tenfold cross-validation. Sensitivity analyses on five sub-cohorts with respect to the acquisition phase were conducted. Additional sensitivity analyses after multiple imputation were also conducted. Model performance was assessed using AUC. Results Random forest classifier showed shape metrics featuring within the top 10% performing metrics regardless of phase, attaining the highest variable importance in the corticomedullary phase. Convex hull perimeter ratio is a consistently high-performing shape feature. Shape metrics alone achieved an AUC ranging 0.64-0.68 across multiple classifiers, compared with 0.67-0.75 and 0.68-0.75 achieved by texture-only and combined models, respectively. Conclusion Shape metrics alone attain high prediction performance and high variable importance in the combined model, while being independent of the acquisition phase (unlike texture). Shape analysis therefore should not be overlooked in its potential to distinguish benign from malignant tumors, and future radiomics platforms powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics.","Tomography,X-ray computed,Kidney neoplasms,Data analysis,Machine learning,Image Processing,radiomics",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.87,"CLEAR-CELL,FEATURES,DIFFERENTIATION,CARCINOMA,IMAGES,GRADE",EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,,

Based on this, this paper proposes an ECG signal denoising algorithm based on convolutional auto-encoder neural network. The method utilizes the encoding and decoding characteristics of the auto-encoder, and constructs a deep neural network by convolution to learn the end-to-end mapping from the noisy ECG signal to the clean ECG signal. The convolution layer captures the details of ECG signals content while eliminating noise; the decoding portion can upsample the feature map and restore the ECG signal details to obtain a clean ECG signal. In the experiment, the signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error are used as indicators, and the method is compared with wavelet threshold method, S-transform method, BP neural network method and guided filtering method. The experimental results show that the overall noise reduction accuracy of the noise reduction method is better, and the low frequency components of the signal are also well preserved. The method can eliminate the complex noise in the ECG signal while completely retaining the shape of the ECG signal, which lays a foundation for the intelligent diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and the characteristic detection of ECG.",ECG signal; denoising; auto-encoder; convolutional neural network,Article,,,,,,,,

The first phase of our evaluation was performed on a Labrador Retriever between 12 to 26 weeks in age as a pilot study. The longitudinal weekly data collected revealed the expected trend of a decreasing average heart rate and increased heart rate variability as the age increased. In the second phase, we improved the system ergonomics for a larger scale deployment in a guide dog school (Guiding Eyes for the Blind (Guiding Eyes)) on seventy 7.5-week-old puppies (heart rate coverage average of 86.7%). The acquired ECG based heart rate data was used to predict the performance of puppies in Guiding Eyes's temperament test.

9,A multiscale method for periodic structures using domain decomposition and ECM-hyperreduction,368,,,Hernandez J. A.,Hernandez JA,Hernandez JA,10.1016/j.cma.2020.113192,Polytechnic University of Catalonia,"This paper presents a nonlinear multiscale approach for periodic structures in the quasi-static, small strain regime. The approach consists in combining a domain decomposition method in which interface conditions are established through a ""fictitious"" frame with reduced-order modeling (ROM). We propose to approximate interface displacements, subdomain displacements and Lagrange Multipliers as linear combinations of reduced sets of dominant modes, and to assign to the coefficients of such linear combinations the role of coarse-scale displacements, strains and stresses, respectively. We discuss and propose a method based on subspace rotations that ensures that these three modal approximations lead to stable formulations. The modes of such expansions are determined in an offline ""training"" stage by applying the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the solutions obtained from Finite Element (FE) analyses. In contrast to other multiscale approaches, such as FE-ROM homogenization schemes, which uses a single unit cell with periodic conditions, here the ""training"" structures are formed by several unit cells. This way, we allow the SVD to extract also dominant patterns of interaction between subdomains in terms of reactive forces and deformations. This original feature confers to the proposed approach three unique advantages over FE-ROM homogenization schemes, namely: (1) It can deal with unit cells of arbitrary size (no need for scale separation). (2) It can model, not only how forces are transmitted through the structure, but also local effects. (3) It can also handle domains which are only periodic along one or two directions (beam-like or shell structures, respectively). To deal with material nonlinearities, element-wise Gauss integration of reduced internal forces is replaced by an algorithmically improved version of the hyperreduction scheme recently proposed by the author elsewhere, called the Empirical Cubature Method(ECM). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coarse-scale Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) of a subdomain can be expressed directly in terms of the (fine-scale) stresses and strains at the ECM integration points. This feature dispenses with the need of deploying a special algorithmic infrastructure of intertwined local/global problems, as it occurs in FE-ROM schemes, since the unit cell can be treated as a special type of finite element, in which the centroids of the interfaces and the ECM points play the role of nodes and Gauss points, respectively. To illustrate all these advantages, we present 4 distinct examples: two beam-like structures of rectangular-shape and I-shaped cross-sections, a 2D hexagonal cellular material, and a cylindrical shell made of a porous composite cell. In all 4 cases the proposed method is able to produce coarse-scale models reducing the number of DOFs and integration points by over two orders of magnitude, with errors below 5 %. Interestingly, in the case of the beam-like structures, we show that the method provides 2-node beam finite elements whose kinematics are identical to that predicted by ""analytical"" beam theories (6 DOFs per node in the case of the rectangular beam), and totally consistent with their 3D full-order counterparts.

The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used.

Therefore, it is of much practical significance to accurately and efficiently predict creep life. Here, we develop a divide-and-conquer self-adaptive (DCSA) learning method incorporating multiple material descriptors for rational and accelerated prediction of the creep rupture life. We characterize a high-quality creep dataset of 266 alloy samples with such features as alloy composition, test temperature, test stress, and heat treatment process. In addition, five microstructural parameters related to creep process, including stacking fault energy, lattice parameter, mole fraction of the gamma' phase, diffusion coefficient and shear modulus, are calculated and introduced by the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method and basic materials structure-property relationships, that enables us to reveal the effect of microstructure on creep properties. The machine learning explorations conducted on the creep dataset demonstrate the potential of the approach to achieve higher prediction accuracy with RMSE, MAPE and R-2 of 0.3839, 0.0003 and 0.9176 than five alternative state-of-the-art machine learning models. On the newly collected 8 alloy samples, the error between the predicted creep life value and the experimental measured value is within the acceptable range (6.4486 h-40.7159 h), further confirming the validity of our DCSA model. Essentially, our method can establish accurate structure-property relationship mapping for the creep rupture life in a faster and cheaper manner than experiments and is expected to serve for inverse design of alloys.

12,Integrated and intelligent design framework for cemented paste backfill: A combination of robust machine learning modelling and multi-objective optimization,155,,,"Qi Chongchong,Chen Qiusong,Kim S. Sonny","Qi CC,Chen QS,Kim SS",Qi CC,10.1016/j.mineng.2020.106422,Central South University,"Modern mining industry thrives for energy-efficient, clean and sustainable mining processes. The cemented paste backfill (CPB) technology, which may constitute 25-30% of the total mining cost, is no exception. One of the major bottlenecks for the current CPB design is that different steps were considered separately. No integrated design frameworks have been proposed, hindering the selection of the optimal CPB processing parameters. Towards this end, this study introduces an integrated and intelligent design framework for CPB (IIDF_CPB). The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed IIDF_CPB rely on two important parts. For one thing, robust machine learning (ML) modelling from constituent materials/processing parameters to performance indicators is established. Accurate ML modelling can save lots of time and substantially reduce the number of lab experiments. For another, IIDF_CPB is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem where two or more objectives need to be optimized simultaneously. The methodology of IIDF_CPB is presented and its feasibility is validated using a comprehensive case study. In the case study, ML modelling is conducted using a hybrid method that combines gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to maximize two conflicting performance indicators, namely slump and unconfined compressive strength at 28 days (28-UCS). The case study shows that the GBRT-PSO is robust in the slump and 28-UCS predictions. The average correlation coefficient between experimental and predicted outputs is 0.970 for slump and 0.991 for UCS. NSGA-II is effective in the concurrent optimization of slump and 28-UCS, which determines the Pareto front and maintains the diversity of non-dominated points.","Cemented paste backfill,Integrated and intelligent design framework,Multi-objective optimization",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mineralogy,Mining & Mineral Processing",,4.884,"TAILINGS,STRENGTH,PERFORMANCE,ALGORITHM,SELECTION,BEHAVIOR",MINERALS ENGINEERING,,

In this work, we employed artificial neural networks to predict the fracture stress of defective graphene samples. First, shallow neural networks were used to predict the fracture stress, which depends on the temperature, vacancy concentration, strain rate, and loading direction. A part of the data required to model the shallow networks was obtained by developing an analytical solution based on the Bailey durability criterion and the Arrhenius equation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also used to obtain some data. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the features learnt by the neural network, and their behaviour under extrapolation was also investigated. Subsequently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict the fracture stress of graphene samples containing random distributions of vacancy defects. Data required to model CNNs was obtained from MD simulations. Our results reveal that the neural networks have a strong ability to predict the fracture stress of defective graphene under various processing conditions.

This greatly extends the scope of accurate molecular simulations, providing opportunities for quantitative design of materials and devices on scales hitherto unreachable by DFT methods. However, machine learning IPs have a basic limitation in that they lack a physical model for the phenomena being predicted and therefore have unknown accuracy when extrapolating outside their training set. In this paper, we propose a class of Dropout Uncertainty Neural Network (DUNN) potentials that provide rigorous uncertainty estimates that can be understood from both Bayesian and frequentist statistics perspectives. As an example, we develop a DUNN potential for carbon and show how it can be used to predict uncertainty for static and dynamical properties, including stress and phonon dispersion in graphene. We demonstrate two approaches to propagate uncertainty in the potential energy and atomic forces to predicted properties. In addition, we show that DUNN uncertainty estimates can be used to detect configurations outside the training set, and in some cases, can serve as a predictor for the accuracy of a calculation.","DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS,CARBON",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"DYNAMICS,SIMULATIONS,CARBON",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00390-8.pdf,

Performing material measurements is time-consuming and often restricted by the fact that material sample preparations are non-trivial, labour-intensive and expensive. Numerical modelling of materials has been studied over the years in order to address these issues and nowadays it has been developed at multi-scale and multi-physics levels. However, numerical models for nano-composites, especially for ferroelectrics, are limited due to multiple unknowns including oxygen vacancy densities, grain sizes and domain boundaries existing in the system. In this work, we introduce a human-machine interactive learning framework by developing a scalable semi-empirical model to accurately predict material properties enabled by deep learning (DL). MgO-Doped BST (BaxSr1-xTiO3) is selected as an example ferroelectric-dielectric composite for validation. The DL model transfer-learns the experimental features of materials from a measurement database which includes data for over 100 different ferroelectric composites collected by screening the published data and combining our own measurement data. The trained DL model is utilized in providing feedback to human researchers, who then refine computer model parameters accordingly, hence completing the interactive learning cycle.

In configuring devices such as batteries or solar cells, not only the functionality of individual constituting materials such as electrodes or electrolyte but also an appropriate combination of materials which do not undergo unwanted side reactions is critical in ensuring their reliable performance in long-term operation. While the universal theory that can predict the general chemical reactivity between materials is long awaited and has been the subject of studies with a rich history, traditional ways proposed to date have been mostly based on simple electronic properties of materials such as electronegativity, ionization energy, electron affinity and hardness/softness, and could be applied to only a small group of materials. Moreover, prediction has often been far from accurate and has failed to offer general implications; thus it was practically inadequate as a selection criterion from a large material database,i.e.data-driven material discovery. Herein, we propose a new model for predicting the general reactivity and chemical compatibility among a large number of organic materials, realized by a machine-learning approach. As a showcase, we demonstrate that our new implemented model successfully reproduces previous experimental results reported on side-reactions occurring in lithium-oxygen electrochemical cells. Furthermore, the mapping of chemical stability among more than 90 available electrolyte solvents and the representative redox mediators is realized by this approach, presenting an important guideline in the development of stable electrolyte/redox mediator couples for lithium-oxygen batteries.","LI-O-2 BATTERIES,REDOX MEDIATORS,HIGH-EFFICIENCY,ELECTROPHILICITY,NUCLEOPHILICITY,ACTIVATION,ENERGY,SCALES,INDEX,RECHARGEABILITY",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",Chemistry,,9.658,"LI-O-2,BATTERIES,REDOX,MEDIATORS,HIGH-EFFICIENCY,ELECTROPHILICITY,NUCLEOPHILICITY,ACTIVATION,ENERGY,SCALES,INDEX,RECHARGEABILITY",CHEMICAL SCIENCE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8163198,
22,Patient-specific PTV margins for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy determined using support vector classification with an early warning system for margin adaptation,47,10,5172-5182,"Liu Ming,Cygler Joanna E.,Vandervoort Eric","Liu M,Cygler JE,Vandervoort E",Vandervoort E,10.1002/mp.14419,Carleton University,"Purpose An adaptive planning target volume (PTV) margin strategy incorporating a volumetric tracking error assessment after each fraction is proposed for robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) liver treatments. Methods and materials A supervised machine learning algorithm employing retrospective data, which emulates a dry-run session prior to planning, is used to investigate if motion tracking errors are <2 mm, and consequently, planning target volume (PTV) margins can be reduced. A fraction of data collected during the beginning of a treatment course emulates a dry-run session (mock) before planning. Twenty features are calculated using mock data and used for support vector classification (SVC). A treatment course is labeled as Class 1 if the maximum root-mean-square radial tracking error for all remaining fractions is below 2 mm, or Class 2 otherwise. We evaluate the classification using fivefold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, 500 repeated random subsampling cross-validation, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) metric. The classification is independently cross-validated on a cohort of 48 treatment plans for other anatomical sites. A per fraction assessment of volumetric tracking errors is performed for the standard 5 mm PTV margin (PTVstd) for courses predicted as Class 2; or for a margin reduced by 2 mm (PTVstd-2mm) for those predicted as Class 1. We perturb the gross tumor volume (GTV) by the tracking errors for each x-ray image acquisition and calculate the fractional GTV voxel occupancy probability (P-i) inside the PTV for each treatment fractioni. For treatment courses classified as Class 1, an early warning system flags treatment courses having anyP(i) < 0.99, and the subsequent treatments are proposed to be replanned using PTVstd. Results The classification accuracies are 0.84 +/- 0.06 using fivefold cross-validation, and 0.77 when validated using an independent testing set (other anatomical sites). Eighty percent of treatment courses are correctly classified using leave-one-out cross-validation. The sensitivity, precision, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy are 0.81 +/- 0.09, 0.85 +/- 0.08, 0.80 +/- 0.11, 0.83 +/- 0.06, and 0.80 +/- 0.07, respectively, using 500 repeated random subsampling cross-validation. The area under the curve for the ROC metric is 0.87 +/- 0.05. The four most important features for classification are related to standard deviations of motion tracking errors, the linearity between the target location and external LED marker positions, and marker radial motion amplitudes. Eleven of 64 cases predicted to be of Class 1 have 0.96 P-i < 0.99 for each treatment fraction, and require replanning using PTVstd. In comparison, the PTV(std)always covers the perturbed GTVs withP(i) > 0.99 for all patients. Conclusions Support vector classification is proposed for the classification of different motion tracking errors for patient courses based on a mock session before planning for SBRT liver treatments. It is feasible to implement patient-specific PTV margins in the clinic, assisted with an early warning system to flag treatment courses that require replanning using larger PTV margins in an adaptive treatment strategy.","ablative treatment,adaptive,classification,liver cancer,motion tracking,patient-specific,SBRT",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"BLADDER-CANCER,PREDICTION,SBRT,RADIOTHERAPY,ACCURACY,MOTION,STATE,RISK,TOOL",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Recently, the two-dimensional (2D) HOIPs have emerged as a potential candidate for a new class of ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature and spontaneous polarization. Room-temperature solution-processability further makes HOIP a promising alternative to traditional oxide ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 and PbTiO3. In this perspective, we focus on the molecular aspects of 2D HOIPs, their correlation with macroscopic properties, as well as the material design rules assisted by advanced simulation tools (e.g., machine learning and atomistic modeling techniques). The perspective provides a comprehensive discussion on the structural origin of ferroelectricity, current progress in the design of new materials, and potential opportunities and challenges with emerging materials. We expect that this perspective will provide inspiration for innovation in 2D HOIP ferroelectrics.","REACTIVE MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,THIN-FILMS,TEMPERATURE FERROELECTRICITY,HALIDE PEROVSKITES,HIGH-PERFORMANCE,SOLAR-CELLS,HYDROCARBONS,REAXFF,DESIGN,INFRASTRUCTURE",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"REACTIVE,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,THIN-FILMS,TEMPERATURE,FERROELECTRICITY,HALIDE,PEROVSKITES,HIGH-PERFORMANCE,SOLAR-CELLS,HYDROCARBONS,REAXFF,DESIGN,INFRASTRUCTURE",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0016010,

Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large and multidimensional datasets, these techniques are strictly based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased interpretation. The interpretability of machine-learning results in materials science, specifically materials' functionalities, can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data handling. The use of techniques such as dimensional stacking can provide the much needed physical and chemical constraints, while proper understanding of the assumptions imposed by model parameters can help avoid overinterpretation. These concepts are illustrated by application to recently reported ferroelectric switching experiments in PbZr(0.2)Ti(0.8)O(3)thin films. Through systematic analysis and introduction of physical constraints, it is argued that the behaviors present are not necessarily due to exotic mechanisms previously suggested, but rather well described by classical ferroelectric switching superimposed by non-ferroelectric phenomena, such as electrochemical deformation, electrostatic interactions, and/or charge injection.","dimensional reduction,dimensional stacking,ferroelectric thin films,machine learning,physical and chemical constraints,piezoresponse force microscopy,polarization switching",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,30.254,DOMAIN-WALLS,ADVANCED MATERIALS,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/adma.202002425,

Nanomechanical mapping (NM) is needed to investigate, for example, dynamic evolution of the nanomechanical distribution of the sample-provided that the mapping is fast enough. The throughput of conventional NM methods, however, is inherently limited by the continuous scanning involved where the probe visits each sampling location continuously. Thus, we propose to significantly reduce the number of measurements through discrete mapping where only discrete sampling locations of interests are visited and measured. An online-searching learning-based technique is utilized to achieve rapid probe engagement and withdrawal with the interaction force minimized at each sampling location. Then, a control-based nanoindentation measurement technique is used to quickly acquire the nanomechanical property at each location, over frequencies that can be chosen arbitrarily in a broad range. Finally, a decomposition-based learning approach is explored to achieve rapid probe transitions between the sampling locations. The proposed technique is demonstrated through experiments using a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sample and a PDMS-epoxy sample as examples.","atomic force microscope,nanomechanical mapping,fibonacci searching,learning-based online optimization,soft materials",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,3.618,"OUTPUT,TRACKING,NANOINDENTATION,INVERSION,PREVIEW",NANOTECHNOLOGY,,

For MOF chemists, the chemical design space is a combination of pore geometry, metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups, but at present we do not have a formalism to quantify optimal coverage of chemical design space. In this work, we develop a machine learning method to quantify similarities of MOFs to analyse their chemical diversity. This diversity analysis identifies biases in the databases, and we show that such bias can lead to incorrect conclusions.

With the first ratification of a computer vision algorithm as a medical device in 2018, the way was paved for these methods to eventually become an integral part of modern clinical practice. Objectives The purpose of this article is to review the main developments that have occurred over the last few years in AI for image analysis, in relation to clinical applications and dermatology. Materials and methods Following the annual ImageNet challenge, we review classical methods of machine learning for image analysis and demonstrate how these methods incorporated human expertise but failed to meet industrial requirements regarding performance and scalability. With the rise of deep learning based on artificial neural networks, these limitations could be overcome. We discuss important aspects of this technology including transfer learning and report on recent developments such as explainable AI and generative models. Results Deep learning models achieved performance on a par with human experts in a broad variety of diagnostic tasks and were shown to be suitable for industrialization. Therefore, current developments focus less on further improving accuracy but rather address open issues such as interpretability and applicability under clinical conditions. Upcoming generative models allow for entirely new applications. Conclusions Deep learning has a history of remarkable success and has become the new technical standard for image analysis. The dramatic improvement these models brought over classical approaches enables applications in a rapidly increasing number of clinical fields.

We investigate the dynamics and magnetic properties of the plasma, including the line-of-sight velocity (LOS) and optical depth, as well as the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields, belonging to an erupted solar filament.Methods. The filament eruption was observed with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph at the 1.5-meter GREGOR telescope on July 3, 2016. We acquired three consecutive full-Stokes slit-spectropolarimetric scans in the HeI 10830 angstrom spectral range. The Stokes I profiles were classified using the machine learning k-means algorithm and then inverted with different initial conditions using the HAZEL code.Results. The erupting-filament material presents the following physical conditions: (1) ubiquitous upward motions with peak LOS velocities of similar to 73 km s(-1); (2) predominant large horizontal components of the magnetic field, on average, in the range of 173-254 G, whereas the vertical components of the fields are much lower, on average between 39 and 58 G; (3) optical depths in the range of 0.7-1.1. The average azimuth orientation of the field lines between two consecutive raster scans (<2.5 min) remained constant.Conclusions. The analyzed filament eruption belongs to the fast rising phase, with total velocities of about 124 km s(-1). The orientation of the magnetic field lines does not change from one raster scan to the other, indicating that the untwisting phase has not yet started. The untwisting appears to start about 15 min after the beginning of the filament eruption.","Sun: filaments,prominences,Sun: chromosphere,Sun: magnetic fields,methods: data analysis,techniques: high angular resolution,techniques: polarimetric",Article,"EDP SCIENCES S A, 17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",Astronomy & Astrophysics,,,"FLUX,ROPE,SPECTROPOLARIMETRY,MULTIPLET,PROFILES,VECTOR,FLARES,HANLE,LINE",ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10473,

In this study, we constructed five common algorithms, and introduced 565 donor/acceptor (D/A) combinations as training data sets to evaluate the practicalities of these ML algorithms and their application potential when guiding material design and D/A pairs screening. Thus, the best predictive capabilities are provided by using the random forest (RF) and boosted regression trees (BRT) approaches beyond other ML algorithms in the data set. Furthermore, >32 million D/A pairs were screened and calculated by RF and BRT models, respectively. Among them, six photovoltaic D/A pairs are selected and synthesized to compare their predicted and experimental power conversion efficiencies.

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models. This makes the time-consuming process easier and faster for radiologists and this reduces the spread of virus and save lives.","Chest X-Ray,Computed tomography,COVID-19,Haralick feature,Transfer learning,Viral pneumonia",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,4.602,,APPLIED INTELLIGENCE,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10489-020-01831-z.pdf,

Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository Web site (http://frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future.","2D IR SPECTROSCOPY,2-DIMENSIONAL INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY,PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE,HYDROGEN-BOND DYNAMICS,SOLVATOCHROMIC COMPARISON METHOD,CLASSICAL MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,FREQUENCY GENERATION SPECTROSCOPY,(CD-ALPHA)-D-ALPHA STRETCH MODE,TIME-DOMAIN CALCULATIONS,CARBON-DEUTERIUM BONDS",Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,66.813,"2D,IR,SPECTROSCOPY,2-DIMENSIONAL,INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY,PROTEIN,SECONDARY,STRUCTURE,HYDROGEN-BOND,DYNAMICS,SOLVATOCHROMIC,COMPARISON,METHOD,CLASSICAL,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,FREQUENCY,GENERATION,SPECTROSCOPY,%28CD-ALPHA%29-D-ALPHA,STRETCH,MODE,TIME-DOMAIN,CALCULATIONS,CARBON-DEUTERIUM,BONDS",CHEMICAL REVIEWS,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/4744462/1/Jonathan Hirst Vibrational Spectroscopic Map,

We collected chest CT scans of 202 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19, and try to develop a rapid, accurate and automatic tool for severity screening follow-up therapeutic treatment. Methods A total of 729 2D axial plan slices with 246 severe cases and 483 non-severe cases were employed in this study. By taking the advantages of the pre-trained deep neural network, four pre-trained off-the-shelf deep models (Inception-V3, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) were exploited to extract the features from these CT scans. These features are then fed to multiple classifiers (linear discriminant, linear SVM, cubic SVM, KNN and Adaboost decision tree) to identify the severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. Three validation strategies (holdout validation, tenfold cross-validation and leave-one-out) are employed to validate the feasibility of proposed pipelines. Results and conclusion The experimental results demonstrate that classification of the features from pre-trained deep models shows the promising application in COVID-19 severity screening, whereas the DenseNet-201 with cubic SVM model achieved the best performance. Specifically, it achieved the highest severity classification accuracy of 95.20% and 95.34% for tenfold cross-validation and leave-one-out, respectively. The established pipeline was able to achieve a rapid and accurate identification of the severity of COVID-19.

To save on the computational requirements, ASLA utilizes the DFT program in a single-point mode, i.e., without allowing for relaxation of the structural candidates according to the force information at the DFT level. In this work, we augment ASLA to establish a surrogate energy model concurrently with its structure search. This enables approximative but computationally cheap relaxation of the structural candidates before the single-point energy evaluation with the computationally expensive DFT program. We demonstrate a significantly increased performance of ASLA for building benzene while utilizing a surrogate energy landscape. Further, we apply this model-enhanced ASLA in a thorough investigation of the c(4x8) phase of the Ag(111) surface oxide.

Many state-of-art methods used so far classify the images by applying machine learning algorithms on manually extracted features from imaging modalities.

However, existing machine learning approaches to diagnosis are purely associative, identifying diseases that are strongly correlated with a patients symptoms.

To overcome this, we reformulate diagnosis as a counterfactual inference task and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms. We compare our counterfactual algorithms to the standard associative algorithm and 44 doctors using a test set of clinical vignettes. While the associative algorithm achieves an accuracy placing in the top 48% of doctors in our cohort, our counterfactual algorithm places in the top 25% of doctors, achieving expert clinical accuracy.

Explicit evaluation of temperature dependent scattering time or the electron relaxation time (tau(el) ) is thus necessary to assess the efficiency of thermoelectrics. Experimental or computational measurement of tau(el) is very challenging due to the inherent time limitation and high computational cost. Herein, a statistical machine learning (ML) based approach has been developed to predict the experimental electrical conductivity (sigma) followed by an estimation of the relaxation time (tau(el)). By utilizing a unique mean ranking method for feature selection, simple elemental properties such as the boiling point, melting point, molar heat capacity, electron affinity, and ionization energy are identified as the potential descriptors for sigma. Using a data set of 124 compounds, a Gradient Boost Regression (GBR) model is developed, which has very small root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.22 S/cm and a high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 for prediction of log-scaled sigma.

To overcome the limitations given by manual and semi-automatic segmentation tools, we apply a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically segment the CTA scans of the aortic lumen, from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries, accounting for 3D spatial coherence. Methods A first convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to coarsely segment and locate the aorta in the whole sub-sampled CTA volume, then three single-view CNNs are used to effectively segment the aortic lumen from axial, sagittal, and coronal planes under higher resolution. Finally, the predictions of the three orthogonal networks are integrated to obtain a segmentation with spatial coherence. Results The coarse segmentation performed to identify the aortic lumen achieved a Dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.92 +/- 0.01. Single-view axial, sagittal, and coronal CNNs provided a DSC of 0.92 +/- 0.02, 0.92 +/- 0.04, and 0.91 +/- 0.02, respectively. Multi-view integration provided a DSC of 0.93 +/- 0.02 and an average surface distance of 0.80 +/- 0.26 mm on a test set of 10 CTA scans. The generation of the ground truth dataset took about 150 h and the overall training process took 18 h.

The present study aimed to develop a mathematical model for predicting the in-hospital mortality among patients with postoperative sepsis. Materials and Methods:Surgical patients in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database who simultaneously fulfilled Sepsis 3.0 and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria at ICU admission were incorporated. We employed both extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and stepwise logistic regression model to predict the in-hospital mortality among patients with postoperative sepsis. Consequently, the model performance was assessed from the angles of discrimination and calibration. Results:We included 3,713 patients who fulfilled our inclusion criteria, in which 397 (10.7%) patients died during hospitalization, and 3,316 (89.3%) patients survived through discharge. Fluid-electrolyte disturbance, coagulopathy, renal replacement therapy (RRT), urine output, and cardiovascular surgery were important features related to the in-hospital mortality. The XGBoost model had a better performance in both discriminatory ability (c-statistics, 0.835 vs. 0.737 and 0.621, respectively; AUPRC, 0.418 vs. 0.280 and 0.237, respectively) and goodness of fit (visualized by calibration curve) compared to the stepwise logistic regression model and baseline model. Conclusion:XGBoost model has a better performance in predicting hospital mortality among patients with postoperative sepsis in comparison to the stepwise logistic regression model.

The accurate classification of individual and combined finger movements using surface EMG signals is able to support many applications such as dexterous prosthetic hand control. The existing research of EMG-based hand gesture classification faces the challenges of inaccurate classification, insufficient generalization ability and weak robustness. To address these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning model that combines convolutional auto-encoder and convolutional neural network (CAE+CNN) to classify an EMG dataset consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures. The proposed method shrinks the inputs into a smaller latent space representation using CAE and the resultant compressed features are served as inputs of CNN, which reduces the redundancy of EMG signals and improves the classification accuracy and training efficiency. Besides, to enhance the robustness and generalization ability for classification, a data processing approach is proposed which combines the windowing method and majority voting of the obtained results from the classifier. In addition, comprehensive comparative study is carried out with 8 widely applied and state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy, robustness subject to noise and statistical analysis (sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 Score and Matthews correlation coefficient). The results demonstrates that the integration of windowing method, CAE+CNN and majority voting achieves the best performance (99.38% test accuracy for the data without adding noise, which is 3.78% higher than the best classifier used for comparison), strongest robustness (achieved 98.13% test accuracy when Gaussian noise of level le-5 is added to the raw dataset, which is 4.07% higher than the best classifier used for comparison) and statistical properties compared to other classifiers, which shows the potential for healthcare applications such as movement intention detection and dexterous prostheses control.

The first experiment of this study showed that the best FOT parameter was the resonance frequency, providing moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.87). In the second experiment, a neuro-fuzzy classifier and different supervised machine learning techniques were investigated, includingk-nearest neighbors, random forests, AdaBoost with decision trees, and support vector machines with a radial basis kernel. All classifiers achieved high accuracy (AUC >= 0.9) in the differentiation between patient groups. In the third and fourth experiments, the use of different feature selection techniques allowed us to achieve high accuracy with only three FOT parameters. In addition, the neuro-fuzzy classifier also provided rules to explain the classification.

Left Ventricle walls become thick due to prolonged hypertension which may fail to pump heart effectively. The imaging techniques can be used as an alternative diagnose LVH; however, they are more expensive and time-consuming than proposed LVH. To overcome this issue, an algorithm to the diagnosis of LVH using ECG signal based on machine learning techniques were designed. In LVH detection, the pathological attributes such as R wave, S wave, inversion of QRS complex, changes in ST segment noticed in the ECG signal. This clinical information extracted as a feature by applying continuous wavelet transform. The signals were reconstructed with the frequency between 10 and 50 Hz from the wavelet. This followed by the detection of R wave and S wave peaks to obtain the relevant LVH diagnostic features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Ensemble of Bagged Tree, AdaBoost classifiers were employed and the results are compared with four neural network classifiers including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Scaled Conjugate Gradient Backpropagation Neural Network (SCG NN), Levenberg-Marquardt Neural Network (LMNN) and Resilient Backpropagation Neural network (RPROP).

The most important challenges in PET image processing are noise removal and region of interests (ROIs) segmentation. Although denoising and segmentation are performed independently, but the performance of the denoising process significantly affects the performance of the segmentation process. Due to the low signals to noise ratio and low contrast, PET image denoising is a challenging task. Individual wavelet, curvelet and non-local means (NLM) based methods are not well suited to handle both isotropic (smooth details) and anisotropic (edges and curves) features due to its restricted abilities. To address these issues, the present work proposes an efficient denoising framework for reducing the noise level of brain PET images based on the combination of multi-scale transform (wavelet and curvelet) and tree clustering non-local means (TNLM). The main objective of the proposed method is to extract the isotropic features from a noisy smooth PET image using tree clustering based non-local means (TNLM). Then curvelet-based denoising is applied to the residual image to extract the anisotropic features such as edges and curves. Finally, the extracted anisotropic features are inserted back into the isotropic features to obtain an estimated denoised image. Simulated phantom and clinical PET datasets have been used in this proposed work for testing and measuring the performance in the medical applications, such as gray matter segmentation and precise tumor region identification without any interaction with other structural images like MRI or CT. The results in the experimental section show that the proposed denoising method has obtained better performance than existing wavelet, curvelet, wavelet-curvelet, non-local means (NLM) and deep learning methods based on the preservation of the edges. Qualitatively, a notable gain is achieved in the proposed denoised PET images in terms of contrast enhancement than other existing denoising methods.","PET,Denoising,Wavelet,Curvelet,Non-local means,Residual image",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,"NOISE,RECONSTRUCTION,RESOLUTION,REDUCTION,CURVELETS",MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

Materials and methods In this work, 191 radiomic features were extracted from mp-MRI from prostate cancer patients. A comprehensive set of support vector machine (SVM) models for T2WI and mp-MRI (T2WI + DWI, T2WI + DTI, and T2WI + DWI + DTI) were developed based on novel Bayesian parameters optimization method and validated using leave-one-patient-out approach to eliminate any possible overfitting. The diagnostic performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the models were evaluated using the test data set and the corresponding binary maps generated. Finally, the SVM plus sigmoid function of the models with the highest performance were used to produce cancer probability maps. Results The T2WI + DWI + DTI models using the optimal feature subset achieved the best performance in prostate cancer detection, with the average AUROC , sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93 +/- 0.03, 0.85 +/- 0.05, 0.82 +/- 0.07, and 0.83 +/- 0.04, respectively.

However, visual assessment of nodules is difficult and often affected by inter- and intraobserver variabilities. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach based on machine learning and information fusion to discriminate the nature of thyroid nodules. Statistical features are extracted from the B-mode ultrasound image while deep features are extracted from the shear-wave elastography image. Classifiers including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine are adopted to train classification models with statistical features and deep features, respectively, for comparison.

The method requires the measurement of strains from the considered structure, which are used to set up, train, and test artificial neural networks (ANNs). At the end of the training phase, the networks find correlations between the given strains, which represent the 'fingerprint' of the structure under investigation. Changes in the distribution of these strains is captured by assessing differences in the previously identified strain correlations. If any cause generates damage that alters the strain distribution, this is considered as a reason for further detailed structural inspection. The novelty of the strain algorithm comes from its independence from both the choice of material and the loading condition. It does not require the prior knowledge of material properties based on stress-strain relationships and, as the strain correlations represent the structure and its mechanical behaviour, they are valid for the full range of operating loads. An implementation of such approach is herein presented based on the usage of a distributed optical fibre sensor that allows to obtain strain measurement with an incredibly high resolution.","Structural health monitoring,Composite materials,Machine learning,Optical fibres,Distributed strain sensing",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,2.118,"DIGITAL,IMAGE,CORRELATION,SENSORS",APPLIED COMPOSITE MATERIALS,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10443-020-09829-z.pdf,

We show that individual data points introduce a significant chance factor in both model training and quality measurement. This chance factor can be mitigated by the introduction of an ensemble-averaged model. This model presents the highest accuracy, while at the same time, it is robust with regard to changing the dataset size.

Recently, performance improvements have been in large part due to changes in the composition of the cathode material family, LiNixMnyCo(1-x-y)O2 (e.g., 111-622-811). Despite the importance of these materials and tremendous progress with density functional theory (DFT) calculations in understanding basic design principles, it is computationally prohibitively expensive to make this problem tractable. Specifically, predicting the open circuit voltage for any cathode material in this family requires evaluation of stability in a quaternary phase space. In this work, we develop machine-learning potentials using fingerprinting based on atom-centered symmetry functions, used with a neural network model, trained on DFT calculations with a prediction accuracy of 3.7 meV/atom and 0.13 eV/angstrom for energy and force, respectively. We perform hyperparameter optimization of the fingerprinting parameters using Bayesian optimization through the Dragonfly package. Using this ML calculator, we first test its performance in predicting thermodynamic properties within the Debye-Gruneisen model and find good agreement for most thermodynamic properties, including the Gibbs free energy and entropy. Then, we use this to calculate the Li-vacancy ordering as a function of Li composition to simulate the process of discharging/charging of the cathode using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations.

To remedy this issue, we used randomly generated symmetrical crystal structures to train a more general Si-MLFF. Furthermore, we performed substantial benchmarks among different choices of material descriptors and regression techniques on two different sets of silicon data. Our results show that neural network potential fitting with bispectrum coefficients as descriptors is a feasible method for obtaining accurate and transferable MLFFs.","APPROXIMATION,DEFORMATION,MECHANISM",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"APPROXIMATION,DEFORMATION,MECHANISM",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00972,

In this research, we investigate the microscopic origin of the dissipative processes as a result of the frictional response, with the aim to control them in a subtle way. We recast the study of friction in terms of phonon modes of the system at the equilibrium, with no need to resort to dynamics simulations. As a case study, we here consider layer sliding in transition metal dichalcogenides thin films. We find that the population of specific atomic orbitals and the relative contribution of the atomic type to selected system vibrations are the crucial quantities which determine the frictional response in tribological conditions. A reduced amount of energy dissipation is found when the bond character is more ionic and the layer sliding is realized by a faster motion of the chalcogen atoms. The individuated relevant parameters governing the energy dissipation can be used as descriptors in high-throughput calculations or machine learning engines to screen databases of frictional materials. The presented framework is general and can be promptly extended to the design of tribological materials with targeted frictional response, irrespective of the chemistry and atomic topology.","ELECTRON LOCALIZATION,NANOSCALE,FRICTION,CRYSTAL",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"ELECTRON,LOCALIZATION,NANOSCALE,FRICTION,CRYSTAL",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,,

Conventional analytical algorithms, such as filtered backprojection (FBP), are not successful due to incomplete projection data. Moreover, model-based iterative total variation algorithms effectively reduce small streaks but do not work well at eliminating large streaks. In contrast, FBP mapping networks and deep-learning-based postprocessing networks are outstanding at removing large streak artifacts; however, these methods perform processing in separate domains, and the advantages of multiple deep learning algorithms operating in different domains have not been simultaneously explored. In this paper, we present a hybrid-domain convolutional neural network (hdNet) for the reduction of streak artifacts in limited-angle computed tomography. The network consists of three components: the first component is a convolutional neural network operating in the sinogram domain, the second is a domain transformation operation, and the last is a convolutional neural network operating in the CT image domain. After training the network, we can obtain artifact-suppressed CT images directly from the sinogram domain. Verification results based on numerical, experimental and clinical data confirm that the proposed method can significantly reduce serious artifacts.","computed tomography (CT),convolutional neural network (CNN),domain transformation,limited-angle,streak artifacts",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"TOTAL,VARIATION,MINIMIZATION,CT,RECONSTRUCTION,SPARSE-DATA,PROJECTION,ALGORITHM,FRAMELETS,TV",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

By extracting large amounts of quantitative features and mining them, radiomics has achieved success in predicting treatment outcomes for various diseases. However, there are several challenges associated with conventional radiomic approaches, including: (1) how to optimally combine information extracted from multiple modalities; (2) how to construct models emphasizing different objectives for different clinical applications; and (3) how to utilize and fuse output obtained by multiple classifiers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified model termed as multifaceted radiomics (M-radiomics). In M-radiomics, a deep learning with stacked sparse autoencoder is first utilized to fuse features extracted from different modalities into one representation feature set. A multi-objective optimization model is then introduced into M-radiomics where probability-based objective functions are designed to maximize the similarity between the probability output and the true label vector. Finally, M-radiomics employs multiple base classifiers to get a diverse Pareto-optimal model set and then fuses the output probabilities of all the Pareto-optimal models through an evidential reasoning rule fusion (ERRF) strategy in the testing stage to obtain the final output probability. Experimental results show that M-radiomics with the stacked autoencoder outperforms the model without the autoencoder. M-radiomics obtained more accurate results with a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than other single-objective or single-classifier-based models.","distant metastasis prediction,head & neck cancer,radiomics,stacked autoencoder,multi-objective optimization,evidential reasoning rule",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"STACKED,AUTOENCODER,ALGORITHM,IMAGES,MODEL,MRI",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

Artificial intelligence is beneficial in the automatic detection of many diseases where early diagnosis is vital for human life. In this study, an effective classification method is presented for a gastrointestinal tract classification task that contains a small number of labeled data and has a sample number of imbalance between classes. According to our approach, using an effective classifier at the end of the convolutional neural network (CNN) structure produces the desired performance even if the CNN structure is not strongly trained.

Experiments are conducted using AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet architectures to test the contribution of the proposed approach to the classification performance. Besides, three different experiments are carried out for each architecture where the sample numbers are kept constant as 2500, 5000, and 7500.

Initiation of chemical reactions occurs at hot spots due to energy localization at sites of porosities and other defects. Emerging multi-scale predictive models of HE response to loads account for the physics at the meso-scale, i.e. at the scale of statistically representative clusters of particles and other features in the microstructure. Meso-scale physics is infused in machine-learned closure models informed by resolved meso-scale simulations. Since microstructures are stochastic, ensembles of meso-scale simulations are required to quantify hot spot ignition and growth and to develop models for microstructure-dependent energy deposition rates. We propose utilizing generative adversarial networks (GAN) to spawn ensembles of synthetic heterogeneous energetic material microstructures. The method generates qualitatively and quantitatively realistic microstructures by learning from images of HE microstructures. We show that the proposed GAN method also permits the generation of new morphologies, where the porosity distribution can be controlled and spatially manipulated. Such control paves the way for the design of novel microstructures to engineer HE materials for targeted performance in a materials-by-design framework.","COMPOSITE PROPELLANT,SURROGATE MODELS,INITIATION,MECHANISMS,MORPHOLOGY,COLLAPSE,SINGLE,IMPACT",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"COMPOSITE,PROPELLANT,SURROGATE,MODELS,INITIATION,MECHANISMS,MORPHOLOGY,COLLAPSE,SINGLE,IMPACT",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70149-0.pdf,

Medical image recognition based on machine learning can effectively reduce the workload and improve the level of automation. So, we use machine learning to identify CTCs. First, we collected the CTC test results of 600 patients. After immunofluorescence staining, each picture presented a positive CTC cell nucleus and several negative controls. The images of CTCs were then segmented by image denoising, image filtering, edge detection, image expansion and contraction techniques using python's openCV scheme. Subsequently, traditional image recognition methods and machine learning were used to identify CTCs. Machine learning algorithms are implemented using convolutional neural network deep learning networks for training. We took 2300 cells from 600 patients for training and testing.

Reconstruction algorithms entail transforming signals collected by acquisition hardware into interpretable images. Reconstruction is a challenging task given the ill-posedness of the problem and the absence of exact analytic inverse transforms in practical cases. While the last decades witnessed impressive advancements in terms of new modalities, improved temporal and spatial resolution, reduced cost, and wider applicability, several improvements can still be envisioned such as reducing acquisition and reconstruction time to reduce patient's exposure to radiation and discomfort while increasing clinics throughput and reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, the deployment of biomedical imaging in handheld devices with small power requires a fine balance between accuracy and latency. The design of fast, robust, and accurate reconstruction algorithms is a desirable, yet challenging, research goal. While the classical image reconstruction algorithms approximate the inverse function relying on expert-tuned parameters to ensure reconstruction performance, deep learning (DL) allows automatic feature extraction and real-time inference. Hence, DL presents a promising approach to image reconstruction with artifact reduction and reconstruction speed-up reported in recent works as part of a rapidly growing field.

At present, traditional methods to detect FDK are time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, we propose herein a new spectral classification index (NSCI) method that can provide simple and low-cost FDK detection by analysing spectra in the wavelength range 350-2500 nm. The proposed index was based on the spectral reflectance and its first derivative. Frequency histograms were plotted for each class of index value, and Gaussian curve fitting was carried out for each histogram. Wheat kernels were then classified by using the intersection of the Gaussian curves as a threshold. The classification of NSCI for spectral data obtained the detection accuracy of 0.97, with a specificity of 0.99, a sensibility of 0.93 and a training time of 15.07 s. Compared with other spectral indexes and machine learning methods, the NSCI was more equilibrated in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Meanwhile, the threshold could be tuned to adjust accuracy, sensitivity or specificity to satisfy different practical needs. We also applied the NSCI for kernel hyperspectral data in another year, and the classification results is promising. The proposed method has the potential for the rapid and simple detection of FDK in wheat.","Spectral reflectance,Machine learning,Fusarium damages kernel,Two-band index,Index distribution",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Food Science & Technology,,3.07,"SINGLE,CORN,KERNELS,HEAD,BLIGHT,CHLOROPHYLL,CONTENT,DAMAGED,KERNELS,REFLECTANCE,CANOPY,DEOXYNIVALENOL,TRANSMITTANCE,IMAGES,SCAB",FOOD ANALYTICAL METHODS,,

Once the person is diagnosed with glaucoma, it cannot be treated entirely, but it can be controlled. If glaucoma is not diagnosed in time, it will lead to vision loss by damaging the Optic Nerve Head. The glaucoma detection is performed based on the optic disc and optic cup parameters on the retinal part of the eye. In the existing system, many image processing and machine learning techniques used for the segmentation and classification of optic disc and optic cup. To improve the precision of diagnosis, the existing techniques used need an improvement. This article helps readers with more information about the existing methods applied for the diagnosis of glaucoma, it also lists the research gaps and technical challenges to improve the accuracy of segmentation and classification methods.","Intraocular pressure (IOP),Optic disc (OD),Optic cup (OC),Optic nerve head (ONH),Convolutional neural network (CNN)",Review,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"DIAGNOSIS,EXTRACTION,DISEASE",SN APPLIED SCIENCES,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-020-03221-z.pdf,

Variations are made in the orientation of the fibres to determine which orientation made the composite the strongest. The fibre strands are arranged in different orientations, such as the uniaxial, biaxial and criss-cross arrangements, to differentiate between the orientations and observe which arrangement exhibited the best mechanical behaviour. The fibres are initially washed with 0.5% weight/volume (w/v) NaOH solution, following which specimens of the composites are made using wooden moulds designed according to ASTM standards. Biaxial layers of E-glass are incorporated into the matrix in an attempt to enhance the mechanical properties of the specimen. The variances observed in the Young's modulus are analysed to understand the factors that majorly impacted it. For a better understanding of the results, the chemical functional groups and the microstructure of the samples are analysed with the aid of Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD). Additionally, predictive models are simulated using Artificial and Deep Neural Networks to recognise patterns in the data, by varying specific parameters. The results obtained indicated that Banyan fibre composites can replace conventionally-used materials and serve real-world purposes better.","Analysis of variances,artificial neural networks,Banyan,deep neural networks,E-glass,epoxy-reinforced,Field emission scanning electron microscopy,flexural strength,Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,tensile strength,X-ray diffraction",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,2.552,"NATURAL,FIBER,POLYMER,COMPOSITES,TENSILE",JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS,,
99,Scalable approach to high coverages on oxides via iterative training of a machine-learning algorithm,12,17,4317-4330,"Liu Fuzhu,Yang Shengchun,Medford Andrew J.","Liu FZ,Yang SC,Medford AJ",Medford AJ,10.1002/cctc.201902345,University System of Georgia,"Understanding the interaction of multiple types of adsorbate molecules on solid surfaces is crucial to establishing the stability of catalysts under various chemical environments. Computational studies on the high coverage and mixed coverages of reaction intermediates are still challenging, especially for transition-metal compounds. In this work, we present a framework to predict differential adsorption energies and identify low-energy structures under high- and mixed-adsorbate coverages on oxide materials. The approach uses Gaussian process machine-learning models with quantified uncertainty in conjunction with an iterative training algorithm to actively identify the training set. The framework is demonstrated for the mixed adsorption of CHx, NH(x)and OH(x)species on the oxygen vacancy and pristine rutile TiO2(110) surface sites. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient at identifying the most valuable training data, and is able to predict differential adsorption energies with a mean absolute error of similar to 0.3 eV based on <25 % of the total DFT data. The algorithm is also used to identify 76 % of the low-energy structures based on <30 % of the total DFT data, enabling construction of surface phase diagrams that account for high and mixed coverage as a function of the chemical potential of C, H, O, and N. Furthermore, the computational scaling indicates the algorithm scales nearly linearly (N-1.12) as the number of adsorbates increases. This framework can be directly extended to metals, metal oxides, and other materials, providing a practical route toward the investigation of the behavior of catalysts under high-coverage conditions.","lateral adsorbate interactions,adsorbate-adsorbate interactions,Gaussian process,surface phase diagram",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",Chemistry,,5.329,"OXYGEN,EVOLUTION,ELECTROCATALYSIS,TRANSITION-METAL,OXIDE,ADSORBATE,INTERACTIONS,LATERAL,INTERACTIONS,TIO2%28110%29,SURFACE,CARBON-MONOXIDE,CO2,REDUCTION,ADSORPTION,NO,CHEMISORPTION",CHEMCATCHEM,,
100,Uncertainty-quantified parametrically homogenized constitutive models (UQ-PHCMs) for dual-phase alpha/beta titanium alloys,6,1,,"Kotha Shravan,Ozturk Deniz,Ghosh Somnath","Kotha S,Ozturk D,Ghosh S",Ghosh S,10.1038/s41524-020-00379-3,Johns Hopkins University,"This paper develops an uncertainty-quantified parametrically homogenized constitutive model (UQ-PHCM) for dual-phase alpha/beta titanium alloys such as Ti6242S. Their microstructures are characterized by primary alpha-grains consisting ofhcpcrystals and transformed beta-grains consisting of alternating laths of alpha(hcp) and beta(bcc) phases. The PHCMs bridge length-scales through explicit microstructural representation in structure-scale constitutive models. The forms of equations are chosen to reflect fundamental deformation characteristics such as anisotropy, length-scale dependent flow stresses, tension-compression asymmetry, strain-rate dependency, and cyclic hardening under reversed loading conditions. Constitutive coefficients are functions of representative aggregated microstructural parameters or RAMPs that represent distributions of crystallographic orientation and morphology. The functional forms are determined by machine learning tools operating on a data-set generated by crystal plasticity FE analysis. For the dual phase alloys, an equivalent PHCM is developed from a weighted averaging rule to obtain the equivalent material response from individual PHCM responses of primary alpha and transformed beta phases. The PHCMs are readily incorporated in FE codes like ABAQUS through user-defined material modeling windows such as UMAT. Significantly reduced number of solution variables in the PHCM simulations compared to micromechanical models, make them several orders of magnitude more efficient, but with comparable accuracy. Bayesian inference along with a Taylor-expansion based uncertainty propagation method is employed to quantify and propagate different uncertainties in PHCM such asmodel reduction error,data sparsity errorandmicrostructural uncertainty. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy of PHCM and the relative importance of different sources of uncertainty.","CRYSTAL PLASTICITY FE,FATIGUE-CRACK NUCLEATION,STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT RVES,MICROSTRUCTURAL PARAMETERS,CREEP,SIZE,DEFORMATION,SIMULATIONS,MECHANISMS,BOUNDARIES",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"CRYSTAL,PLASTICITY,FE,FATIGUE-CRACK,NUCLEATION,STATISTICALLY,EQUIVALENT,RVES,MICROSTRUCTURAL,PARAMETERS,CREEP,SIZE,DEFORMATION,SIMULATIONS,MECHANISMS,BOUNDARIES",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00379-3.pdf,
