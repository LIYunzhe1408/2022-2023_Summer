The system uses the experiences it previously acquired and stored into its case base to address the newly faced problems. A static and non-evolutive case base hinders the system and limits the accuracy of the CBR in problem-solving. While a massive case base can affect the resolution time. Randomization represents a way to generate data without deteriorating the spatial image of the case base and by extension the search time as well. However, the cases generated by randomization are not necessarily valid and require a thorough validation process to access their validity. This paper presents a new amplification technique based on randomization for a CBR system incorporating a structured case-base that speeds up case retrieval while supporting case retention. The generated data by randomization is validated through a three-layer validation process: coherence verification, stochastic validation, and absolute validation. Furthermore, we propose a new way to segment the case base along with new similarity functions based on features' weights to speed CBR retrieval. We carried out experiments on mammography mass and thyroid disease datasets to validate our approach, where the proposed approach is compared to several popular supervised machine-learning methods and other related works that utilize the same datasets. Experiments have shown that our approach can generate relevant data, which significantly improves the resolution accuracy and makes CBR a good competitor to classification methods.

Results Both machine learning methods were able to mitigate artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and diffusion parameter maps. The CNN for complex images was also able to reduce artifacts in partial Fourier acquisitions. Conclusions The proposed CNNs extend the ability of artifact correction in diffusion MRI.

Here, the utility of kernel-based support vector machine learning using density functional theory calculations as training data is evaluated when used to predict equilibrium binding coefficients of small molecules with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). We find that utilising SVMs may confer some predictive ability. This algorithm was then used to predict the binding of drugs TAK-580 and selumetinib. The algorithm did predict strong binding for TAK-580 and poor binding for selumetinib, and these results were experimentally validated. It was discovered that the larger homologue cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) is partial to selumetinib, suggesting an opportunity for tunable release by introducing different concentrations of CB[7] or CB[8] into a hydrogel depot. We qualitatively demonstrated that these drugs may have utility in combination against gliomas. Finally, mass transfer simulations show CB[7] can independently tune the release of TAK-580 without affecting selumetinib. This work gives specific evidence that a machine learning approach to recognition of small molecules by macrocycles has merit and reinforces the view that machine learning may prove valuable in the development of drug delivery systems and supramolecular chemistry more broadly.","BRAF,CLASSIFICATION,INHIBITION,PEPTIDE,CANCER",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,3.802,"BRAF,CLASSIFICATION,INHIBITION,PEPTIDE,CANCER",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/307110/1/Chem_Sci_ML_Paper_Manuscript%20%283%29.pdf,

Due to complex anatomical brain structure and intensity variations in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an appropriate skull stripping is an important part. The process of skull stripping basically deals with the removal of the skull region for clinical analysis in brain segmentation tasks, and its accuracy and efficiency are quite crucial for diagnostic purposes. It requires more accurate and detailed methods for differentiating brain regions and the skull regions and is considered as a challenging task. This paper is focused on the transition of the conventional to the machine- and deep-learning-based automated skull stripping methods for brain MRI images. It is observed in this study that deep learning approaches have outperformed conventional and machine learning techniques in many ways, but they have their limitations.

A simple descriptor, mu /t, where mu and t are the octahedral and tolerance factors, respectively, is identified, which accelerates the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved OER activity. We successfully synthesise five new oxide perovskites and characterise their OER activities.

The current practice of collateral scoring relies on visual inspection and thus can suffer from inter and intra-rater inconsistency. We present a robust and automatic method to score cerebral collateral blood supply to aid ischemic stroke treatment decision making. The developed method is based on 4D dynamic CT angiography (CTA) and the ASPECTS scoring protocol. Methods The proposed method, ACCESS (Automatic CollateralCirculationEvaluation in iSchemicStroke), estimates a target patient's unfilled cerebrovasculature in contrast-enhanced CTA using the lack of contrast agent due to clotting. To do so, the fast robust matrix completion algorithm with in-face extended Frank-Wolfe optimization is applied on a cohort of healthy subjects and a target patient, to model the patient's unfilled vessels and the estimated full vasculature as sparse and low-rank components, respectively. The collateral score is computed as the ratio of the unfilled vessels to the full vasculature, mimicking existing clinical protocols. Results ACCESS was tested with 46 stroke patients and obtained an overall accuracy of 84.78%. The optimal threshold selection was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristics curve with the leave-one-out approach, and a mean area under the curve of 85.39% was obtained. Conclusion ACCESS automates collateral scoring to mitigate the shortcomings of the standard clinical practice. It is a robust approach, which resembles how radiologists score clinical scans, and can be used to help radiologists in clinical decisions of stroke treatment.","Ischemic stroke,Collateral supply,CT angiography,Low-rank and sparse",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,AGREEMENT,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

The discovery and full characterization of new perovskite-derived materials are limited by the difficulty of growing high quality crystals needed for single-crystal Xray diffraction studies. We present an automated, high-throughput approach for metal halide perovskite single crystal discovery based on inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) as a means to rapidly identify and optimize synthesis conditions for the formation of high quality single crystals. Using this automated approach, a total of 8172 metal halide perovskite synthesis reactions were conducted using 45 organic ammonium cations. This robotic screening increased the number of metal halide perovskite materials accessible by an ITC synthesis route by more than 5-fold and resulted in the formation of two new phases, [C2H7N2][PbI3] and [C7H16N](2)[PbI4]. This comprehensive data set allows for a statistical quantification of the total experimental space and of the likelihood of large single crystal formation. Moreover, this data set enables the construction and evaluation of machine learning models for predicting crystal formation conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept that combining high throughput experimentation and machine learning accelerates and enhances the study of metal halide perovskite crystallization. This approach is designed to be generalizable to different synthetic routes for the acceleration of materials discovery.","LEAD HALIDE PEROVSKITES,HIGH-PERFORMANCE,THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY,IODIDE PEROVSKITE,SOLAR-CELLS,COMBINATORIAL,FORMAMIDINIUM,TRANSPORT,EXPERIMENTATION,MECHANISMS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Materials Science",,10.837,"LEAD,HALIDE,PEROVSKITES,HIGH-PERFORMANCE,THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY,IODIDE,PEROVSKITE,SOLAR-CELLS,COMBINATORIAL,FORMAMIDINIUM,TRANSPORT,EXPERIMENTATION,MECHANISMS",CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS,https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.10013090.v1,

Understanding the relationship between a material's structure and functionality is an important step in the process, such that viable polymorphs for a given chemical composition need to be identified. Machine-learning-based surrogate models have the potential to accelerate the search for polymorphs that target specific applications. Herein, we report a readily generalizable active-learning (AL) accelerated algorithm for identification of electrochemically stable iridium oxide polymorphs of IrO2 and IrO3. The search is coupled to a subsequent analysis of the electrochemical stability of the discovered structures for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Structural candidates are generated by identifying all 956 structurally unique AB(2) and AB(3) prototypes in existing materials databases (more than 38000). Next, using an active learning approach, we find 196 IrO2 polymorphs within the thermodynamic amorphous synthesizability limit and reaffirm the global stability of the rutile structure. We find 75 synthesizable IrO3 polymorphs and report a previously unknown FeF3-type structure as the most stable, termed alpha-IrO3. To test the algorithms performance, we compare to a random search of the candidate space and report at least a 2-fold increase in the rate of discovery. Additionally, the AL approach can acquire the most stable polymorphs of IrO2 and IrO3 with fewer than 30 density functional theory optimizations. Analysis of the structural properties of the discovered polymorphs reveals that octahedral local coordination environments are preferred for nearly all low-energy structures. Subsequent Pourbaix Ir-H2O analysis shows that alpha-IrO3 is the globally stable solid phase under acidic OER conditions and supersedes the stability of rutile IrO2. Calculation of theoretical OER surface activities reveal ideal weaker binding of the OER intermediates on alpha-IrO3 than on any other considered iridium oxide. We emphasize that the proposed AL algorithm can be easily generalized to search for any binary metal oxide structure with a defined stoichiometry.","CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,WATER,ELECTROCATALYSTS,RUTHENIUM,ALGORITHM,INSIGHTS,XTALOPT,COBALT",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Materials Science",,10.837,"CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,WATER,ELECTROCATALYSTS,RUTHENIUM,ALGORITHM,INSIGHTS,XTALOPT,COBALT",CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1656769,

In this work, we apply machine learning models to simulate charge and exciton propagation in organic semiconductors.

An N(2)adsorption isotherm at 77 K is the most widely used approach to characterize porosity. Conventionally, textual properties such as surface area and pore volumes are derived from the N(2)adsorption isotherm at 77 K by fitting it to adsorption theory and then correlating it to gas separation performance (uptake and selectivity). Here the N(2)isotherm at 77 K was used directly as input (representing feature descriptors for the porosity) to train convolutional neural networks to predict gas separation performance (using CO2/N(2)as a test case) for porous carbons. The porosity space for porous carbons was explored for higher CO2/N(2)selectivity.

These special properties originate from the formation of a bandgap that prevents the excitation of entire frequency ranges in the phononic band diagram. Unfortunately, identifying phononic crystals with useful bandgaps is a problematic process because not all phononic crystals have bandgaps. Predicting if a phononic crystal structure has a bandgap, and if so, the gap's center frequency and width is a computationally expensive process. Herein, we explore machine learning as a rapid screening tool for expedited discovery of phononic bandgap presence, center frequency, and width. We test three different machine learning algorithms (logistic/linear regression, artificial neural network, and random forests) and show that random forests performs the best. For example, we show that a random phononic crystal selection has only a 17% probability of having a bandgap, whereas after incorporating rapid screening with the random forests model, this probability increases to 89%. When predicting the bandgap center frequency and width, this model achieves coefficient of determinations of 0.66 and 0.85, respectively. If the model has a priori knowledge that a bandgap exists, the coefficients of determination for center and width improve to 0.97 and 0.85, respectively. We show that most of the model's performance gains are achieved for training datasets as small as similar to 5000 samples. Training the model with just 500 samples led to reduced performance but still yielded algorithms with predictive values.","ACOUSTIC BAND-STRUCTURE,DESIGN,OPTIMIZATION,WAVES,GAME,GO",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"ACOUSTIC,BAND-STRUCTURE,DESIGN,OPTIMIZATION,WAVES,GAME,GO",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,,

Models of MR features for predicting malignant and benign lesions as well as subtyping SRM were developed using a training dataset and performance was evaluated in a test data-set using recursive partitioning (RP), gradient booting machine (GBM), and random forest (RF) methods. Results In the test dataset, GBM and RF models demonstrated an accuracy of 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%) for predicting benign versus malignant SRM compared to 83% (95% CI 71% to 91%) for the RP model. RF had the greatest accuracy in predicting SRM subtypes, 81.2% (95% CI 69.5% to 89.9%) compared with GBM 73.4% (95% CI 60.9% to 83.7%) or RP 70.3% (95% CI 57.6% to 81.1%).

Methods Sixty-four-patient image datasets based on coronary CTA were retrospectively collected to generate eight views considering 45 degrees increments around the coronary artery centerline. The dataset was randomly split into training and testing cohorts. Invasive FFR measurements were used as ground truth labels. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and the model's capacity to predict severity of CAD was assessed on the testing cohort. Classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis were performed. Similar CAD severity classification accuracy and AUROC analyses were performed using only percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and CT-derived FFR performed by 13 operators with various levels of expertise. Results Classification accuracy over the test cohort was 80.9% using the trained network and 72.4% using the user-operated CT-derived FFR software. AUROC over the test cohort was 0.862 using the trained network, 0.807 using %DS, and 0.758 using the human-operated CT-derived FFR software. Conclusions A trained neural network compared noninferiorly in-terms of classification accuracy and AUROC with human operators of a CT-derived FFR software, and in-terms of AUROC with clinical decision-making using %DS.","coronary artery disease,coronary computed tomography angiography,fractional flow reserve",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"FRACTIONAL,FLOW,RESERVE,ENDOVASCULAR,PROCEDURES,MEDICAL,THERAPY,GRAY,ZONE,PREVENTION,STENOSIS,FAME,PCI",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

The purpose of this study is the development of a robust interactive segmentation method for accurate segmentation of the prostate from MR images. Methods We propose an interactive segmentation method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) to refine the automatically segmented results. An atrous multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder is proposed to learn representative features to obtain accurate segmentations. Based on the multiscale feature, a GCN block is presented to predict the prostate contour in both automatic and interactive manners. To preserve the prostate boundary details and effectively train the GCN, a contour matching loss is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on 41 in-house MR subjects and 30 PROMISE12 test subjects. Result The proposed method yields mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.8 +/- 1.2% and 94.4 +/- 1.0% on our in-house and PROMISE12 datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Conclusion The proposed interactive segmentation method based on the GCN can accurately segment the prostate from MR images.

Design/methodology/approach A new methodology based on uniaxial tensile tests of filaments and FDM specimens, infill measurement and normalization of the results is proposed and implemented. A total of 396 specimens made of PLA were evaluated by using variable process parameters. Findings The infill and the build orientation have a large influence on the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile stress, whereas the layer thickness and the infill pattern have a low influence on these properties. The elongation at break is not influenced by the process parameters except by the build orientation. Furthermore, the infill values measured on the test specimens differ from the nominal values provided by the system. Research limitations/implications The analysis of the structural properties of FDM samples is limited to uniaxial loading conditions. Practical implications The obtained results are valuable for the structural analysis and numerical simulation of FDM components and for potential studies using machine learning techniques to predict the structural response of FDM parts. Originality/value A new experimental methodology that considers the measurement of the real infill percentage and the normalization of the results for inter-comparison with other studies is proposed.

Radiomics-a quantitative method for image analysis-has shown its prognostic ability in different tumor entities and could therefore play an important role in optimizing patient selection for radical cancer treatment. So far, radiomics as a prognostic tool in MPM was not investigated. Materials and methods This study is based on 72 MPM patients treated with surgery in a curative intent at our institution between 2009 and 2017. Pre-treatment Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and CT scans were used for radiomics outcome modeling. After extraction of 1404 CT and 1410 FDG PET features from each image, a preselection by principal component analysis was performed to include only robust, non-redundant features for the cox regression to predict the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS). Results were validated on a separate cohort. Additionally, SUVmax and SUVmean, and volume were tested for their prognostic ability for PFS and OS. Results For the PFS a concordance index (c-index) of 0.67 (95% CI 0.52-0.82) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.78) for the training cohort (n= 36) and internal validation cohort (n= 36), respectively, were obtained for the PET radiomics model. The PFS advantage of the low-risk group translated also into an OS advantage. On CT images, no radiomics model could be trained. SUV max and SUV mean were also not prognostic in terms of PFS and OS. Conclusion We were able to build a successful FDG PET radiomics model for the prediction of PFS in MPM. Radiomics could serve as a tool to aid clinical decision support systems for treatment of MPM in future.","Radiomics,Machine learning,Artificial intelligence,Malignant pleural mesothelioma,Prognostic model,Clinical decision support system",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.471,"TUMOR,VOLUME,EXTRAPLEURAL,PNEUMONECTOMY,DELINEATION,CANCER,RADIOTHERAPY,INFORMATION,VARIABILITY,STABILITY,RADIATION,FEATURES",EJNMMI RESEARCH,https://ejnmmires.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13550-020-00669-3,

A composite strategy incorporating neural network (NN) and cellular automata (CA) is developed to predict the failure load for masonry panels with and without openings subjected to lateral loadings. The discretized panels are modelled by the CA methodology using nine neighbour cells, which derive their state values from geometric parameters and opening location placement for the panels. An identification coefficient dictated by these geometric parameters and experimental data is fed together as the input training data for the NN. The NN uses a backpropagation algorithm and two hidden layers with sigmoid activation functions to predict failure loads. This method achieves greater accuracy in prediction when compared with the yield line and finite elemental analysis (FEA) methods. The results attained elucidate the feasibility of the current methodology to complement conventional approaches such as FEA to provide additional insight into the failure mechanism of masonry panels under varied loading conditions.","COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH,MODEL,WALLS,BEHAVIOR,IDENTIFICATION,PATTERN,SYSTEM",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,1.923,"COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,MODEL,WALLS,BEHAVIOR,IDENTIFICATION,PATTERN,SYSTEM",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2020/9032857.pdf,

Subsequently, a numerical simulation is performed to quantitatively analyze the effect of temperature on frequency in terms of internal force, geometric size, elastic modulus, and boundary condition. It is observed that an unknown factor-except for the elastic modulus-leads to variation in the frequency of the beam mode. The spatial effect of the temperature field is separated by a genetic-algorithm-optimized backpropagation neural network.

First, we use the large materials data set that we have recently proposed to benchmark 21 different functionals, with a particular focus on approximations of the meta-generalized-gradient family. Combining these data with the results for 12 functionals in our previous work, we can analyze in detail the characteristics of each approximation and identify its strong and/or weak points. Beside confirming that mBJ, HLE16 and HSE06 are the most accurate functionals for band gap calculations, we reveal several other interesting functionals, chief among which are the local Slater potential approximation, the GGA AK13LDA, and the meta-GGAs HLE17 and TASK. We also compare the computational efficiency of these different approximations. Relying on these data, we investigate the potential for improvement of a promising subset of functionals by varying their internal parameters. The identified optimal parameters yield a family of functionals fitted for the calculation of band gaps. Finally, we demonstrate how to train machine learning models for accurate band gap prediction, using as input structural and composition data, as well as approximate band gaps obtained from density-functional theory.","GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION,KINETIC-ENERGY DENSITY,IMPROVED ACCURACY,NONCOVALENT INTERACTIONS,PERFORMANCE,POTENTIALS,THERMOCHEMISTRY,ADSORPTION,SCHEMES,SPECTRA",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"GENERALIZED,GRADIENT,APPROXIMATION,KINETIC-ENERGY,DENSITY,IMPROVED,ACCURACY,NONCOVALENT,INTERACTIONS,PERFORMANCE,POTENTIALS,THERMOCHEMISTRY,ADSORPTION,SCHEMES,SPECTRA",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00360-0.pdf,

Existing screening methods based on plate counting or molecular analysis present various tradeoffs with regard to the detection time, accuracy/sensitivity, cost, and sample preparation complexity. Here, we present a computational live bacteria detection system that periodically captures coherent microscopy images of bacterial growth inside a 60-mm-diameter agar plate and analyses these time-lapsed holograms using deep neural networks for the rapid detection of bacterial growth and the classification of the corresponding species. The performance of our system was demonstrated by the rapid detection of Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria (i.e., Klebsiella aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae) in water samples, shortening the detection time by >12 h compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved methods. Using the preincubation of samples in growth media, our system achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of similar to 1 colony forming unit (CFU)/L in <= 9 h of total test time. This platform is highly cost-effective (similar to$0.6/test) and has high-throughput with a scanning speed of 24 cm(2)/min over the entire plate surface, making it highly suitable for integration with the existing methods currently used for bacteria detection on agar plates.

Segmented two-dimensional images were stacked up to build the geometry of the scar area for visualization purposes. Mathematical calculations were executed for the validation of the scar tissue in addition to performing morphological image processing and marking the scar tissue present on the endocardial wall of the left ventricular. We applied convolutional neural network over convolution and pooling the layers with small sizes; we achieved 89.23% accuracy, 91.11% sensitivity, and 87.75% specificity, and found the dissimilarity distance between the normal endocardial tissue distances to be 9.37. This new concept in this study contributes toward a better understanding of scar structure and transmural variation of the endocardial wall of the left ventricular.","Scar tissue,myocardial infarction,convolution neural network,topological data analysis,cardiac remodeling",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Engineering,,1.69,"MAGNETIC-RESONANCE,DIFFUSE,FIBROSIS,HETEROGENEITY,SEGMENTATION,ENHANCEMENT",PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE,,

Therefore, identifying critical risk factors for MBC continues to be a major research imperative, and one which can lead to advances in breast cancer clinical care. The objective of this research is to leverage Bayesian Networks (BN) and information theory to identify key risk factors for breast cancer metastasis from data.MethodsWe develop the Markov Blanket and Interactive risk factor Learner (MBIL) algorithm, which learns single and interactive risk factors having a direct influence on a patient's outcome. We evaluate the effectiveness of MBIL using simulated datasets, and compare MBIL with the BN learning algorithms Fast Greedy Search (FGS), PC algorithm (PC), and CPC algorithm (CPC). We apply MBIL to learn risk factors for 5year breast cancer metastasis using a clinical dataset we curated. We evaluate the learned risk factors by consulting with breast cancer experts and literature. We further evaluate the effectiveness of MBIL at learning risk factors for breast cancer metastasis by comparing it to the BN learning algorithms Necessary Path Condition (NPC) and Greedy Equivalent Search (GES).ResultsThe averages of the Jaccard index for the simulated datasets containing 2000 records were 0.705, 0.272, 0.228, and 0.147 for MBIL, FGS, PC, and CPC respectively. MBIL, NPC, and GES all learned that grade and lymph_nodes_positive are direct risk factors for 5year metastasis. Only MBIL and NPC found that surgical_margins is a direct risk factor. Only NPC found that invasive is a direct risk factor. MBIL learned that HER2 and ER interact to directly affect 5year metastasis. Neither GES nor NPC learned that HER2 and ER are direct risk factors.DiscussionThe results involving simulated datasets indicated that MBIL can learn direct risk factors substantially better than standard Bayesian network learning algorithms.

The models tested in this work include five recently published compositional models, a baseline model using stoichiometry alone, and a structural model. By testing seven machine learning models for formation energy on stability predictions using the Materials Project database of DFT calculations for 85,014 unique chemical compositions, we show that while formation energies can indeed be predicted well, all compositional models perform poorly on predicting the stability of compounds, making them considerably less useful than DFT for the discovery and design of new solids. Most critically, in sparse chemical spaces where few stoichiometries have stable compounds, only the structural model is capable of efficiently detecting which materials are stable. The nonincremental improvement of structural models compared with compositional models is noteworthy and encourages the use of structural models for materials discovery, with the constraint that for any new composition, the ground-state structure is not known a priori.

The five types of white blood cells includeneutrophils,eosinophils,lymphocytes,monocytes, andbasophils, where each type constitutes a different proportion and performs specific functions. Being able to classify and, therefore, count these different constituents is critical for assessing the health of patients and infection risks. Generally, laboratory experiments are used for determining the type of a white blood cell. The staining process and manual evaluation of acquired images under the microscope are tedious and subject to human errors. Moreover, a major challenge is the unavailability of training data that cover the morphological variations of white blood cells so that trained classifiers can generalize well. As such, this paper investigates image transformation operations and generative adversarial networks (GAN) for data augmentation and state-of-the-art deep neural networks (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet, and DenseNet) for the classification of white blood cells into the five types. Furthermore, we explore initializing the DNNs' weights randomly or using weights pretrained on the CIFAR-100 dataset. In contrast to other works that require advanced image preprocessing and manual feature extraction before classification, our method works directly with the acquired images. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed method can successfully classify white blood cells. The best DNN model, DenseNet-169, yields a validation accuracy of 98.8%.

The results indicate that, as the number of plastic hinges inside the strip increases, the damper ductility increases, producing a stable hysteresis graph. In addition, a new equation that considers the damage index using parameters such as maximum strength and effective stiffness is proposed, and the experimental results are found to be in excellent agreement with the number of failure cycles obtained from the proposed model.

However, most of existing biomedical segmentation researches take account of the application cases with adapting a single type of medical images from the corresponding examining method. Considering of practical clinic application of the radiology examination for diseases, the multiple image examination methods are normally required for final diagnosis especially in some severe diseases like cancers. Therefore, by considering the cases of employing multi-modal images and exploring the effective multi-modality fusion based on deep networks, we do the research to make full use of complementary information of multi-modal images referring to the clinic experiences of radiologists in image analysis.MethodsReferring to the human radiologist diagnosis experience, we discuss and propose a new self-attention aware mechanism to improve the segmentation performance by paying the different attention on different modal images and different symptoms. Firstly, we propose a multi-path encoder and decoder deep network for 3D biomedical segmentation. Secondly, to leverage the complementary information among different modalities, we introduce a structure of attention mechanism called the Multi-Modality Self-Attention Aware (MMSA) convolution. Multi-modal images we used in the paper are different modalities of MR scanning images, which are input into the network separately. Then self-attention weight fusion of multi-modal features is performed with our proposed MMSA, which can adaptively adjust the fusion weights according to the learned contribution degree of different modalities and different features revealing the different symptoms from the labeled data.ResultsExperiments have been done on the public competition dataset BRATS-2015.

A spiking neural network (SNN) model is utilized to demonstrate the ability to precisely recall a spike pattern after presenting a single input. We show by using a simulation study that the temporal properties of input patterns can be transformed into spatial patterns of local dendritic spikes. The localization of time-points of spikes is facilitated by phase-shift of the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (SMO) in the dendritic branches, which modifies their excitability. In reference to the points in time of the arriving input, the dendritic spikes are triggered in different branches. To store spatially distributed patterns, two unsupervised learning mechanisms are utilized. Either synaptic weights to the branches, spatial representation of the temporal input pattern, are enhanced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) or the oscillation power of SMOs in spiking branches is increased by dendritic spikes. For retrieval, spike bursts activate stored spatiotemporal patterns in dendritic branches, which reactivate the original somatic spike patterns. The simulation of the prototypical model demonstrates the principle, how linking time to space enables the storage of temporal features of an input.

For improving the image detail representation, the AlexNet network structure of fully convolutional network is optimized with fully connected skip structure. In addition, the output of net model is optimized with fully connected conditional random field to improve the characterization of spatial consistency and pixels' correlation of the image. Moreover, a data training optimization method is developed for improving the efficiency of network training. In the experiment. 325 ultrasound images and four error metrics are utilized for validating the segmentation performance. Comparing with existing methods, experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective for handling the breast ultrasound images accurately and reliably.","Breast ultrasound image,Segmentation,Fully convolutional network",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,2.61,"AUTOMATED,SEGMENTATION,DOMAIN,KNOWLEDGE,CLASSIFICATION,MODEL",MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,,

Assisted by machine-learning techniques, rapid, nondestructive and accurate determination of large graphene sheets on SiO2/Si substrates has been made possible in recent years by the optical microscopy method. Optimization of the substrate to achieve the maximum contrast can further extend the application of the optical microscopy method for quality control of the mass-produced graphene. Graphene/n(2)/n(3)three-layer structures, wheren(2)andn(3)are refractive indices, are routinely used for identifying the number of graphene layers by optical reflection microscopy. In this paper, two analytical equations are derived that can be easily used for high-contrast optical imaging of graphene sheets without any need to resort to the cumbersome numerical methods. One of the equations is derived for choosing the best material with refractive indexn(2)that when coated on a substrate with refractive indexn(3), maximizes the optical contrast. The other equation is derived for finding the best thickness of the SiO(2)layer in graphene/SiO2/Si structures, which are in common use for fabrication of graphene-based devices. The results are implemented in a MATLAB GUI, see Supporting Information, to assist the users in using the equations.","graphene,high-contrast,optical imaging,optical microscopy,size-dependent properties",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Anatomy & Morphology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Microscopy",,2.11,"SUSPENDED,GRAPHENE,BERRYS,PHASE,GRAPHITE,ROUTE,GAS",MICROSCOPY RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUE,,

There have been increasing reports of experimental data sets of biological activity, toxicity, and delivery properties of DDNS. However, these data sets are still dispersed and not as large as the datasets of DDNS components (NP and drugs). This has prompted researchers to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that are able to design new DDNS based on the properties of their components. However, most ML models reported up to date predictions of the specific activities of NP or drugs over a determined target or cell line. In this paper, we combine Perturbation Theory and Machine Learning (PTML algorithm) to train a model that is able to predict the best components (NP, coating agent, and drug) for DDNS design. In so doing, we downloaded a dataset of >30 000 preclinical assays of drugs from ChEMBL. We also downloaded an NP data set formed by preclinical assays of coated Metal Oxide Nanoparticles (MONPs) from public sources. Both the drugs and NP datasets of preclinical assays cover multiple conditions of assays that can be listed as two arrays, namely,c(jdrug)andc(jNP). Thec(jdrug)array includes >504 biological activity parameters (c(0drug)), >340 target proteins (c(1drug)), >650 types of cells (c(2drug)), >120 assay organisms (c(3drug)), and >60 assay strains (c(4drug)). On the other hand, thec(jNP)array includes 3 biological activity parameters (c(0NP)), 40 types of proteins (c(1NP)), 10 shapes of nanoparticles (c(2NP)), 6 assay media (c(3NP)), and 12 coating agents (c(4NP)). After downloading, we pre-processed both the data sets by separate calculation PT operators that are able to account for changes (perturbations) in the drug, coating agents, and NP chemical structure and/or physicochemical properties as well as for the assay conditions. Next, we carry out an information fusion process to form a final dataset of above 500 000 DDNS (drug + MONP pairs). We also trained other linear and non-linear PTML models using R studio scripts for comparative purposes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-label PTML model that is useful for the selection of drugs, coating agents, and metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles to be assembled in order to design new DDNS with optimal activity/toxicity profiles.","METAL-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES,CYTOTOXICITY,DELIVERY,SHELL,CLASSIFICATION,REGRESSION,DOCKING",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,7.632,"METAL-OXIDE,NANOPARTICLES,CYTOTOXICITY,DELIVERY,SHELL,CLASSIFICATION,REGRESSION,DOCKING",NANOSCALE,,

In this paper, we utilize the Hilbert space-filling curve for the generation of image representations of sEMG signals, which allows the application of typical image processing pipelines such as CNNs on sequence data. The proposed method is evaluated on different state-of-the-art network architectures and yields a significant classification improvement over the approach without the Hilbert curve.

Research has highlighted important roles that emotions play in learning. We have extended this field of research by exploring the role of emotions in a relatively uncommon learning scenario: learning about queer history with a multimedia mobile app. Specifically, we used an automatic facial recognition software (FaceReader 7) to measure learners' discrete emotions and a counter-balanced multiple-choice quiz to assess learning. We also used an eye tracker (EyeLink 1000) to identify the emotions learners experienced while they read specific content, as opposed to the emotions they experienced over the course of the entire learning session. A total of 33 out of 57 of the learners' data were eligible to be analyzed. Results revealed that learners expressed more negative-activating emotions (ie, anger, anxiety) and negative-deactivating emotions (ie, sadness) than positive-activating emotions (ie, happiness). Learners with an angry emotion profile had the highest learning gains. The importance of examining typically undesirable emotions in learning, such as anger, is discussed using the control-value theory of achievement emotions. Further, this study describes a multimodal methodology to integrate behavioral trace data into learning analytics research. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Multimodal analytics have increasingly gained traction, accompanied by more advanced methodologies and tools. Emotions play a critical role in learning, impacting learners' cognitive, motivational and regulatory processes. The Control Value Theory of Achievement Emotion predicts positive-activating emotions (eg, enjoyment) should lead to better performance. What this paper adds Application of Control Value Theory of Achievement Emotion to a less studied subject domain (ie, history) and issues (ie, LGBTQ rights). Preliminary evidence that negative-activating emotions (eg, anger) can facilitate learning in certain contexts, and that emotions may play different roles depending on the subject matter and domain. Insights into methods of aligning facial recognition data from facial expression analysis software with eye tracking data dealing with dynamic content. Insights into frequency and the types of emotions elicited in learning scenarios dealing with sensitive topics. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators should be aware of different types of emotions, and their roles in learning scenarios. Educators should critically evaluate whether emotions with positive valence always have a positive impact on learning, and vice versa. Learners may not always behaviorally express emotions through facial expressions, including when gazing at sections of learning material directly connected to assessment; therefore, it is helpful to supplement granular with larger timeframe analyses to examine emotional profiles.","MULTIMEDIA,ANALYTICS",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Education & Educational Research,,5.03,"MULTIMEDIA,ANALYTICS",BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,,

The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that multivariate analysis of a classical emotional pictures paradigm would produce meaningful brain signatures with some power to discriminate depressed patients from healthy subjects. Methods Participants in the study were eighteen medicated depressed patients and eighteen sex and age matched healthy controls. Functional MRI paradigm with a visual presentation of emotional pictures (positive, negative and neutral) from the International Affective Pictures System was used. The multivariate linear method (MLM) was used to derive the specific brain signatures on an individual and on a group level. The predictive power of the brain signatures is tested by use of linear discriminant analysis. Results Following the individual and group MLM, the three brain patterns that summarized all the individual variabilities of the individual brain patterns were produced. The discriminant analysis yielded accuracy levels for the three brain signatures ranging from 67 to 98%. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that the multivariate linear method resulted in meaningful brain signatures with significant potential for distinction between healthy and depressed subjects. Such findings will fuel the emerging paradigm shift from more conventional statistical analysis to the probably more appropriate for the field of functional neuroimaging machine learning techniques.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging,Multivariate analysis,Depression,Affective pictures,Clinical diagnosis",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Engineering,,1.733,"DORSOLATERAL,PREFRONTAL,CORTEX,UNIPOLAR,DEPRESSION,MAJOR,DEPRESSION,ANTIDEPRESSANT,TREATMENT,INCREASED,AMYGDALA,MOOD,DISORDERS,ABNORMALITIES,CONNECTIVITY,NEUROANATOMY,METAANALYSIS",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_17849FE2E10B.P001/REF.pdf,

However, the effectiveness of NK cell therapy has been less than optimal for solid tumors, partly due to the heterogeneity in target interaction leading to variable anti-tumor cytotoxicity. This paper describes a microfluidic droplet-based cytotoxicity assay for quantitative comparison of immunotherapeutic NK-92 cell interaction with various types of target cells. Machine learning algorithms were developed to assess the dynamics of individual effector-target cell pair conjugation and target death in droplets in a semi-automated manner. Our results showed that while short contacts were sufficient to induce potent killing of hematological cancer cells, long-lasting stable conjugation with NK-92 cells was unable to kill HER2(+)solid tumor cells (SKOV3, SKBR3) significantly. NK-92 cells that were engineered to express Fc gamma RIII (CD16) mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) selectively against HER2(+)cells upon addition of Herceptin (trastuzumab). The requirement of CD16, Herceptin and specific pre-incubation temperature served as three inputs to generate a molecular logic function with HER2(+)cell death as the output. Mass proteomic analysis of the two effector cell lines suggested differential changes in adhesion, exocytosis, metabolism, transport and activation of upstream regulators and cytotoxicity mediators, which can be utilized to regulate specific functionalities of NK-92 cells in future. These results suggest that this semi-automated single cell assay can reveal the variability and functional potency of NK cells and may be used to optimize immunotherapeutic efficacy for preclinical analyses.","DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY,HUMAN NK-92 CELLS,TARGET,TRASTUZUMAB,ASSAY,TEMPERATURE,AFFINITY,THERAPY,PATHWAY,LINES",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Instruments & Instrumentation",,7.379,"DEPENDENT,CELLULAR,CYTOTOXICITY,HUMAN,NK-92,CELLS,TARGET,TRASTUZUMAB,ASSAY,TEMPERATURE,AFFINITY,THERAPY,PATHWAY,LINES",LAB ON A CHIP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938931,

The magnitude of (c) depends on the binding strength between the rare-earth ion and its coordinating ligands, which is difficult to quantify a priori and makes phosphor design particularly challenging. In this work, a tree-based ensemble learning algorithm employing extreme gradient boosting is trained to predict (c) by analyzing the optical properties of 160 Ce3+ substituted inorganic phosphors. The experimentally measured (c) of these compounds was featurized using the materials' relative permittivity ((r)), average electronegativity, average polarizability, and local geometry. Because the number of reported (r) values is limited, it was necessary to utilize a predicted relative permittivity ((r,SVR)) obtained from a support vector regressor trained on data from similar to 2800 density functional theory calculations.

However, the accuracy of auto-segmentation is challenged by low image contrast, large spatial and inter-patient anatomical variations. In this study, we propose an end-to-end segmentation network, termed self-paced DenseNet, for improved multi-organ segmentation performance, especially for the difficult-to-segment organs. Specifically, a learning-based attention mechanism and dense connection block are seamlessly integrated into the proposed self-paced DenseNet to improve the learning capability and efficiency of the backbone network. To heavily focus on the organs showing low soft-tissue contrast and motion artifacts, a boundary condition is utilized to constrain the network optimization. Additionally, to ease the large learning pace discrepancies of individual organs, a task-wise self-paced-learning strategy is employed to adaptively control the learning paces of individual organs. The proposed self-paced DenseNet was trained and evaluated on a public abdominal CT data set consisting of 90 subjects with manually labeled ground truths of eight organs (including spleen, left kidney, esophagus, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, and duodenum). For quantitative evaluation, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD) were calculated. An average DSC of 84.46% and ASD of 1.82 mm were achieved on the eight organs, which outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods 2.96% on DSC under the same experimental configuration. Moreover, the proposed segmentation method shows notable improvements on the duodenum and gallbladder, obtaining an average DSC of 69.26% and 80.94% and ASD of 2.14 mm and 2.24 mm, respectively. The results are markedly superior to the average DSC of 63.12% and 76.35% and average ASD of 3.87 mm and 4.33 mm using the vanilla DenseNet, respectively, for the two organs. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed self-paced DenseNet to automatically segment abdominal organs with low boundary conspicuity.

Recently, Deep Learning methods using iterative neural networks (NNs) and cascaded NNs have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to various quantitative quality measures as PSNR, NRMSE and SSIM across different imaging modalities. However, the fact that these approaches employ the application of the forward and adjoint operators repeatedly in the network architecture requires the network to process the whole images or volumes at once, which for some applications is computationally infeasible. In this work, we follow a different reconstruction strategy by strictly separating the application of the NN, the regularization of the solution and the consistency with the measured data. The regularization is given in the form of an image prior obtained by the output of a previously trained NN which is used in a Tikhonov regularization framework. By doing so, more complex and sophisticated network architectures can be used for the removal of the artefacts or noise than it is usually the case in iterative NNs. Due to the large scale of the considered problems and the resulting computational complexity of the employed networks, the priors are obtained by processing the images or volumes as patches or slices.

However, accurate registration remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground truth regarding voxel-level spatial correspondence, limited field of view, low contrast-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio in TRUS. In this study, we proposed a fully automated deep learning approach based on a weakly supervised method to address these issues. We employed deep learning techniques to combine image segmentation and registration, including affine and nonrigid registration, to perform an automated deformable MRI-TRUS registration. To start with, we trained two separate fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform a pixel-wise prediction for MRI and TRUS prostate segmentation. Then, to provide the initialization of the registration, a 2D CNN was used to register MRI-TRUS prostate images using an affine registration. After that, a 3D UNET-like network was applied for nonrigid registration. For both the affine and nonrigid registration, pairs of MRI-TRUS labels were concatenated and fed into the neural networks for training. Due to the unavailability of ground-truth voxel-level correspondences and the lack of accurate intensity-based image similarity measures, we propose to use prostate label-derived volume overlaps and surface agreements as an optimization objective function for weakly supervised network training. Specifically, we proposed a hybrid loss function that integrated a Dice loss, a surface-based loss, and a bending energy regularization loss for the nonrigid registration. The Dice and surface-based losses were used to encourage the alignment of the prostate label between the MRI and the TRUS. The bending energy regularization loss was used to achieve a smooth deformation field. Thirty-six sets of patient data were used to test our registration method. The image registration results showed that the deformed MR image aligned well with the TRUS image, as judged by corresponding cysts and calcifications in the prostate. The quantitative results showed that our method produced a mean target registration error (TRE) of 2.53 +/- 1.39 mm and a mean Dice loss of 0.91 +/- 0.02. The mean surface distance (MSD) and Hausdorff distance (HD) between the registered MR prostate shape and TRUS prostate shape were 0.88 and 4.41 mm, respectively. This work presents a deep learning-based, weakly supervised network for accurate MRI-TRUS image registration. Our proposed method has achieved promising registration performance in terms of Dice loss, TRE, MSD, and HD.","deformable image registration,weakly supervised method,prostate,MRI-TRUS,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"IMAGES,ALGORITHMS,FUSION",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771987,

Also, skin lesion images are largely similar in overall appearance owing to the low inter-class variability. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for automatic classification of skin lesion images using adversarial training and transfer learning toward melanoma detection. In the first stage, we leverage the inter-class variation of the data distribution for the task of conditional image synthesis by learning the inter-class mapping and synthesizing under-represented class samples from the over-represented ones using unpaired image-to-image translation. In the second stage, we train a deep convolutional neural network for skin lesion classification using the original training set combined with the newly synthesized under-represented class samples. The training of this classifier is carried out by minimizing the focal loss function, which assists the model in learning from hard examples, while down-weighting the easy ones. Experiments conducted on a dermatology image benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over several standard baseline methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Interestingly, we show through feature visualization and analysis that our method leads to context based lesion assessment that can reach an expert dermatologist level.","adversarial training,transfer learning,domain adaptation,melanoma detection,skin lesion analysis",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"CLASSIFICATION,NETWORKS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06824,

The lack of such a framework is due to limitations in the methods for studying nanowire meshes, in particular the lack of knowledge on the spatial distribution of the nanowires and the change of their position under strain. This hurdle is overcome by collecting 3D reconstructed X-ray tomographies of silver nanowires embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) under variable deformations and the missing structural information of the nanomaterial is obtained by unsupervised artificial intelligence image analysis.

Methods Two phantom experiments were performed. The first used a multisized image quality phantom (Mercury v3.0, Duke University) imaged at five radiation dose levels (CTDIvol: 0.9, 1.2, 3.6, 7.0, and 22.3 mGy) with a fixed tube current technique on a commercial CT scanner (GE Revolution CT). Images were reconstructed with conventional (FBP), iterative (GE ASiR-V), and deep learning-based (GE True Fidelity) reconstruction algorithms. Noise power spectrum (NPS), high-contrast (air-polyethylene interface), and intermediate-contrast (water-polyethylene interface) task transfer functions (TTF) were measured for each dose level and phantom size and summarized in terms of average noise frequency (f(av)) and frequency at which the TTF was reduced to 50% (f(50%)), respectively. The second experiment used a custom phantom with low-contrast rods and lung texture sections for the assessment of low-contrast TTF and noise spatial distribution. The phantom was imaged at five dose levels (CTDIvol: 1.0, 2.1, 3.0, 6.0, and 10.0 mGy) with 20 repeated scans at each dose, and images reconstructed with the same reconstruction algorithms. The local noise stationarity was assessed by generating spatial noise maps from the ensemble of repeated images and computing a noise inhomogeneity index,eta, following AAPM TG233 methods. All measurements were compared among the algorithms. Results Compared to FBP, noise magnitude was reduced on average (+/- one standard deviation) by 74 +/- 6% and 68 +/- 4% for ASiR-V (at ""100%"" setting) and True Fidelity (at ""High"" setting), respectively. The noise texture from ASiR-V had substantially lower noise frequency content with 55 +/- 4% lower NPS f(av)compared to FBP while True Fidelity had only marginally different noise frequency content with 9 +/- 5% lower NPS f(av)compared to FBP. Both ASiR-V and True Fidelity demonstrated locally nonstationary noise in a lung texture background at all radiation dose levels, with higher noise near high-contrast edges of vessels and lower noise in uniform regions. At the 1.0 mGy dose level eta values were 314% and 271% higher in ASiR-V and True Fidelity compared to FBP, respectively. High-contrast spatial resolution was similar between all algorithms for all dose levels and phantom sizes (<3% difference in TTF f(50%)). Compared to FBP, low-contrast spatial resolution was lower for ASiR-V and True Fidelity with a reduction of TTF f(50%)of up to 42% and 36%, respectively. Conclusions The deep learning-based CT reconstruction demonstrated a strong noise magnitude reduction compared to FBP while maintaining similar noise texture and high-contrast spatial resolution. However, the algorithm resulted in images with a locally nonstationary noise in lung textured backgrounds and had somewhat degraded low-contrast spatial resolution similar to what has been observed in currently available iterative reconstruction techniques.","computed tomography,deep learning,image quality,image reconstruction,noise power spectrum",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"RADIATION-DOSE,REDUCTION,ITERATIVE,RECONSTRUCTION,IMAGE,QUALITY,DETECTABILITY,CONTRAST,SCANNERS",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.14319,

Practically, dual-energy data completion is accomplished by estimating missing projection data based on the imaging chain with the full FoV and then by appropriately truncating the analytical reconstruction of the data with the smaller FoV. While this approach works well in many clinical applications, there are applications which would benefit from spectral contrast estimates over the larger FoV (spectral extrapolation)-e.g. model-based iterative reconstruction, contrast-enhanced abdominal imaging of large patients, interior tomography, and combined temporal and spectral imaging. Methods To document the fidelity of spectral extrapolation and to prototype a deep learning algorithm to perform it, we assembled a data set of 50 dual-source, dual-energy abdominal x-ray CT scans (acquired at Duke University Medical Center with 5 SiemensFlashscanners; chain A: 50 cm FoV, 100 kV; chain B: 33 cm FoV, 140 kV + Sn; helical pitch: 0.8). Data sets were reconstructed usingReconCT(v14.1, Siemens Healthineers): 768 x 768 pixels per slice, 50 cm FoV, 0.75 mm slice thickness, ""Dual-Energy - WFBP"" reconstruction mode with dual-source data completion. A hybrid architecture consisting of a learned piecewise linear transfer function (PLTF) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using 40 scans (five scans reserved for validation, five for testing). The PLTF learned to map chain A spectral contrast to chain B spectral contrast voxel-wise, performing an image domain analog of dual-source data completion with approximate spectral reweighting. The CNN with its U-net structure then learned to improve the accuracy of chain B contrast estimates by copying chain A structural information, by encoding prior chain A, chain B contrast relationships, and by generalizing feature-contrast associations. Training was supervised, using data from within the 33-cm chain B FoV to optimize and assess network performance. Results Extrapolation performance on the testing data confirmed our network's robustness and ability to generalize to unseen data from different patients, yielding maximum extrapolation errors of 26 HU following the PLTF and 7.5 HU following the CNN (averaged per target organ). Degradation of network performance when applied to a geometrically simple phantom confirmed our method's reliance on feature-contrast relationships in correctly inferring spectral contrast. Integrating our image domain spectral extrapolation network into a standard dual-source, dual-energy processing pipeline for SiemensFlashscanner data yielded spectral CT data with adequate fidelity for the generation of both 50 keV monochromatic images and material decomposition images over a 30-cm FoV for chain B when only 20 cm of chain B data were available for spectral extrapolation. Conclusions Even with a moderate amount of training data, deep learning methods are capable of robustly inferring spectral contrast from feature-contrast relationships in spectral CT data, leading to spectral extrapolation performance well beyond what may be expected at face value.
Future work reconciling spectral extrapolation results with original projection data is expected to further improve results in outlying and pathological cases.","data completion,deep learning,dual-energy CT,dual-source CT",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"CT,SCAN",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7722037,

If untreated, it may result in varying degrees of vision loss and even blindness. Since DR is a silent disease that may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems, annual eye exams are crucial for early detection to improve chances of effective treatment where fundus cameras are used to capture retinal image. However, fundus cameras are too big and heavy to be transported easily and too costly to be purchased by every health clinic, so fundus cameras are an inconvenient tool for widespread screening. Recent technological developments have enabled to use of smartphones in designing small-sized, low-power, and affordable retinal imaging systems to perform DR screening and automated DR detection using image processing methods. In this paper, we investigate the smartphone-based portable retinal imaging systems available on the market and compare their image quality and the automatic DR detection accuracy using a deep learning framework. Results Based on the results, iNview retinal imaging system has the largest field of view and better image quality compared with iExaminer, D-Eye, and Peek Retina systems. The overall classification accuracy of smartphone-based systems are sorted as 61%, 62%, 69%, and 75% for iExaminer, D-Eye, Peek Retina, and iNview images, respectively.

Methods Three hundred thirty-three patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary gliomas (IDH-mutant = 151 or IDH-wildtype = 182) were retrospectively identified. Raw DSC-MRI data was post-processed for normalised leakage-corrected relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps. Shape, intensity distribution (histogram) and rotational invariant Haralick texture features over the tumour mask were extracted. Differences in extracted features across glioma grades and mutation status were tested using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. A random-forest algorithm was employed (2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted features. Results Shape, distribution and texture features showed significant differences across mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another. Gliomas were correctly stratified by mutation status in 71% and by grade in 53% of the cases (87% of the gliomas grades predicted with distance less than 1).

The design features of DVRNs and the assay conditions of nanoparticles (NPs) and vitamins were included as multiplicative PT operators (PTOs) to the system, which indicates the importance of these variables. However, the previous work omitted experiments with nonlinear ML techniques and different types of PTOs such as metric-based PTOs. More importantly, the previous work does not consider the structure of the anticancer drug to be included in the new DVRNs. In this work, we are going to accomplish three main objectives (tasks). In the first task, we found a new model, alternative to the one published before, for the rational design of DVRNs using metric-based PTOs. The most accurate PTML model was the artificial neural network model, which showed values of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy in the range of 90-95% in training and external validation series for more than 130,000 cases (DVRNs vs ChEMBL assays). Furthermore, in the second task, we used IF techniques to carry out data enrichment of our previous data set. In doi ng so, we constructed a new working data set of >970,000 cases with the data of predinical assays of DVRNs, vitamins, and anticancer compounds from the ChEMBL database. All these assays have multiple continuous variables or descriptors d(k) and categorical variables c(j) (conditions of the assays) for drugs (d(ack), C-acj), vitamins (d(vk), C-vj), and NPs (d(nk), c(nj)) These data include >20,000 potential anticancer compounds with >270 protein targets (c(ac1)), >580 assay cell organisms (C-ac2), and so forth. Furthermore, we include >36,000 assay vitamin derivatives in >6200 types of cells (C-2vit), >120 assay organisms (C-3vit), >60 assay strains (C-4vit), and so forth. The enriched data set also contains >20 types of DVRNs (C-5n) with 9 NP core materials (c(4n)), 8 synthesis methods (C-7n), and so forth. We expressed all this information with PTOs and developed a qualitatively new PTML model that incorporates information of the anticancer drugs. This new model presents 96-97% of accuracy for training and external validation subsets.
In the last task, we carried out a comparative study of ML and/or PTML models published and described how the models we are presenting cover the gap of knowledge in terms of drug delivery. In conclusion, we present here for the first time a multipurpose PTML model that is able to select NPs, anticancer compounds, and vitamins and their conditions of assay for DVRN design.","ChEMBL,nanoparticle,anticancer compounds,PTML,machine learning,big data,multitarget models",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Research & Experimental Medicine,Pharmacology & Pharmacy",,5.144,"METAL-OXIDE,NANOPARTICLES,SIMULTANEOUS,PREDICTION,NANO-QSAR,CYTOTOXICITY,MECHANISMS,DEVELOP",MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS,,

Materials and methods With IRB approval, we retrospectively identified 177 consecutive solid renal masses (116 renal cell carcinoma [RCC]; 51 clear cell [cc], 40 papillary, 25 chromophobe and 61 benign tumors; 49 oncocytomas and 12 fat-poor angiomyolipomas) with renal protocol CT between 2012 and 2017. Tumors were independently segmented by two blinded radiologists. Twenty-five 2-dimensional TA features were extracted from each phase. Diagnostic accuracy for 1) RCC versus benign tumor and 2) cc-RCC versus other tumor was assessed using XGBoost. Results ML of texture analysis features on different phases achieved mean area under the ROC curve (AUC [SD]), sensitivity/specificity for 1) RCC vs benign = 0.70(0.19), 96%/32% on CM-CECT and 0.71(0.14), 83%/58% on NG-CECT and; 2) cc-RCC vs other = 0.77(0.12), 49%/90% on CM-CECT and 0.71(0.16), 22%/94% on NG-CECT. There was no difference in AUC comparing CECT to NCCT (p = 0.058-0.54) and no improvement when combining data across all three phases compared single-phase assessment (p = 0.39-0.68) for either outcome. AUCs decreased when ML models were trained with one phase and tested on a different phase for both outcomes (RCC;p = 0.045-0.106, cc-RCC; < 0.001). Conclusion Accuracy of machine learning classification of renal masses using texture analysis features did not depend on phase; however, models trained using one phase performed worse when tested on another phase particularly when associating NCCT and CECT. These findings have implications for large registries which use varying CT protocols to study renal masses.","Renal cell carcinoma,Computed tomography,Texture analysis,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.965,"CELL,CARCINOMA,DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY,DIFFERENTIATION,FAT,ANGIOMYOLIPOMA,RADIOGENOMICS,ONCOCYTOMA,PREDICTION,SUBTYPES",ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY,,

The approach is based on multi-task deep neural networks that perform automatic detection of the anterior commissures (AC) and posterior commissures (PC) in the sagittal images, and automatic determination of the symmetry line in the axial images. The proposed multi-task learning architecture solves the tasks of point and angle detection simultaneously by exploiting the commonalities and differences across these tasks. This results in improved learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the task-specific models, when compared to training individual models separately. After deriving the AC-PC line and symmetry line on the sagittal image and axial image, respectively, the corresponding scan coverage is then determined by using an image processing approach. Based on a study using a small-sized MR brain image dataset, three benefits are observed: Firstly, our proposed approach was able to perform the task well despite limited availability of training data. This is an advantage in view of the fact that training of single task models will typically encounter difficulty in convergence using a small training set. Secondly, it achieves better performance for landmarks detection in terms of smaller position and angulation shifts between the predicted results and the ground truth. Lastly, the inference can be performed faster since the two tasks are solved simultaneously using only one model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Usually, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Therefore, electroencephalograms have been an essential integral to the researches which aim to automatically detect epilepsy. However, it is difficult because seizure manifestations on scalp EEG are extremely variable between patients, even the same patient. In addition, scalp EEG is usually composed of large number of noise signals which might cover the real features of seizure. To this challenge, we construct an 18-layer Long-Term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN) to automatic epileptogenic zone recognition and localization on scalp EEG. As far as we know, we are the first to train a deep learning classifier to identify seizures through the EEG images, just like neurologists direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Furthermore, unlike the traditionally methods extracted features from channels manually, which neglected the association of brain's epileptiform abnormalities electrical transmission, seizures is considered as a continuous brain's abnormal electrical activity in our algorithm, from produce at one or several channels, transmission between channels, to flat again after seizures. The method was evaluated in 23 patients with a total of 198 seizures. The classifier shows reasonably good results, with 84% for sensitivity, 99% for specificity, and 99% for accuracy.

The quicker detection of leaks, on one hand prevents water loss and helps avoiding economic and environmental leakage consequences. On the other hand, increasing the speed of leak detection increases the false leak detection that imposes high costs. In this paper, we propose a fast hybrid method using AI algorithms and hydraulic relations for detecting and locating leaks and identifying the volume of losses material. The proposed method relies on simple and cost-effective flow sensors installed on each junction in the pipeline network. We demonstrate how influential features for leak detection would be generated by using hydraulic equations like Hazen-Williams, Darcy-Weisbach and pressure drop. Through exploiting Decision Tree, KNN, random forest, and Bayesian network we build predictive models and based on the pipeline topology, we locate leaks and their pressure.

The generally recognized standard for cancer staging is the TNM staging system. In addition, a new parameter called the Immunoscore has been developed recently to assess the survival rate of patients. The Immunoscore is based on counts of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the tumour core and margin. Counting the number of lymphocytes is a tedious process for pathologists. This paper examines the use of deep learning techniques for automatic detection and counting of lymphocytes from immunohistochemistry images of breast, colon, and prostate cancers. Methods We used an object detector called Faster R-CNN with four feature extractors: Resnet-50, VGG-16, Inception-V2, and Resnet-101 for automatic detection and counting of lymphocytes. A total of 11,136 lymphocytes were annotated after performing data augmentation on 1228 images. The test images are separated into three regions of interest (ROI): scattered lymphocytes, groups of lymphocytes, and artefacts. In each ROI, the performance of the object detector was checked by evaluation metrics. Results On comparing the F1-score for all three ROIs, we found that Resnet-101 provides better performance than the other feature extractors when using Faster R-CNN. The mean error in lymphocyte count for all ROIs appears to be insignificant. The detection time for a single image is less for VGG-16 than for other feature extractors. Conclusion This study presents a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN object detector for automatic detection and counting of lymphocytes in three different cancer tissues for scoring lymphocytes. Our results suggest that the Faster R-CNN method is efficient and yields good results. Thus, the proposed method can assist pathologists in providing a cancer prognosis.","Immunohistochemistry,Faster R-CNN,Deep learning,Cancer,Object detection",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Engineering,,1.733,"INFILTRATING,LYMPHOCYTES,CLASSIFICATION,IMMUNOSCORE,PREDICT,NUCLEI",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,
