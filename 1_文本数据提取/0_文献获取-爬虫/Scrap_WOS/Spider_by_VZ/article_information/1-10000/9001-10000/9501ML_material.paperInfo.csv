1,Combining phonon accuracy with high transferability in Gaussian approximation potential models,153,4,,"George Janine,Hautier Geoffroy,Bartok Albert P.,Csanyi Gabor,Deringer Volker L.","George J,Hautier G,Bartok AP,Csanyi G,Deringer VL",Deringer VL,10.1063/5.0013826,University of Oxford,"Machine learning driven interatomic potentials, including Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) models, are emerging tools for atomistic simulations. Here, we address the methodological question of how one can fit GAP models that accurately predict vibrational properties in specific regions of configuration space while retaining flexibility and transferability to others. We use an adaptive regularization of the GAP fit that scales with the absolute force magnitude on any given atom, thereby exploring the Bayesian interpretation of GAP regularization as an ""expected error"" and its impact on the prediction of physical properties for a material of interest. The approach enables excellent predictions of phonon modes (to within 0.1 THz-0.2 THz) for structurally diverse silicon allotropes, and it can be coupled with existing fitting databases for high transferability across different regions of configuration space, which we demonstrate for liquid and amorphous silicon. These findings and workflows are expected to be useful for GAP-driven materials modeling more generally.","SILICON,PRINCIPLES,SOLIDS",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,,"SILICON,PRINCIPLES,SOLIDS",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07046,

Restoring details at a finer scale requires us to generate information following embedded physics and statistics of the models at two different levels of description. Techniques designed to address this persistent challenge balance among accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability. In this work, we present an image-based approach for structural backmapping from coarse-grained to atomistic models with cis-1,4 polyisoprene melts as an illustrative example. Through machine learning, we train conditional generative adversarial networks on the correspondence between configurations at the levels considered. The trained model is subsequently applied to provide predictions of atomistic structures from the input coarse-grained configurations. The effect of different data representation schemes on training and prediction quality is examined. Our proposed backmapping approach shows remarkable efficiency and transferability over different molecular weights in the melt based on training sets constructed from oligomeric compounds. We anticipate that this versatile backmapping approach can be readily extended to other complex systems to provide high-fidelity initial configurations with minimal human intervention.","MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION,CIS-1,4 POLYISOPRENE MELTS,REVERSE-MAPPING PROCEDURE,MODELS,POLYMERS,DYNAMICS,CHAIN,RECONSTRUCTION,POLYSTYRENE",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION,CIS-1%2C4,POLYISOPRENE,MELTS,REVERSE-MAPPING,PROCEDURE,MODELS,POLYMERS,DYNAMICS,CHAIN,RECONSTRUCTION,POLYSTYRENE",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0012320,
3,Intra-subject approach for gait-event prediction by neural network interpretation of EMG signals,19,1,,"Di Nardo Francesco,Morbidoni Christian,Mascia Guido,Verdini Federica,Fioretti Sandro","Di Nardo F,Morbidoni C,Mascia G,Verdini F,Fioretti S",Di Nardo F,10.1186/s12938-020-00803-1,Marche Polytechnic University,"Background Machine learning models were satisfactorily implemented for estimating gait events from surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals during walking. Most of them are based on inter-subject approaches for data preparation. Aim of the study is to propose an intra-subject approach for binary classifying gait phases and predicting gait events based on neural network interpretation of sEMG signals and to test the hypothesis that the intra-subject approach is able to achieve better performances compared to an inter-subject one. To this aim, sEMG signals were acquired from 10 leg muscles in about 10.000 strides from 23 healthy adults, during ground walking, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture was implemented. Results Classification/prediction accuracy was tested vs. the ground truth, represented by the foot-floor-contact signal provided by three foot-switches, through samples not used during training phase. Average classification accuracy of 96.1 +/- 1.9% and mean absolute value (MAE) of 14.4 +/- 4.7 ms and 23.7 +/- 11.3 ms in predicting heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) timing were provided. Performances of the proposed approach were tested by a direct comparison with performances provided by the inter-subject approach in the same population. Comparison results showed 1.4% improvement of mean classification accuracy and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease ofMAEin predicting HS and TO timing (23% and 33% reduction, respectively). Conclusions The study developed an accurate methodology for classification and prediction of gait events, based on neural network interpretation of intra-subject sEMG data, able to outperform more typical inter-subject approaches. The clinically useful contribution consists in predicting gait events from only EMG signals from a single subject, contributing to remove the need of further sensors for the direct measurement of temporal data.","Surface EMG,Machine learning,Neural networks,Gait-phase classification,Ground walking,Intra-subject data",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,2.905,"WALKING,SENSITIVITY,ANKLE",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12938-020-00803-1,

The basic idea of the presented work in this paper is to determine the level of dementia accurately such that the patients can receive medication before their condition worsens. The results produced by existing models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are not satisfactory enough for large datasets. Methods This paper suggests a solution based on Amalgamation of deep learning models. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) Brain, has been used for experimental purposes. The first phase focuses on implementing the primary models i.e., CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The second phase implements ensemble technique to combine these three models using a weighted average approach. An approach called Bagging is applied in all the three models to decrease the variance and the three Bagged models are combined using the ensemble method. Results The results show that the ensemble of CNN, RNN, and LSTM achieved an accuracy of 89.75% whereas the ensemble after Bagging the primary models achieved an accuracy of 92.22%. Conclusion On comparison, the ensemble of Bagged models achieved better results than ensemble of primary models. The comparison is done on the basis of accuracy metric along with sensitivity, specificity and precision.","Deep learning,CNN,Alzheimer's disease,SVM,RNN,LSTM",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Engineering,,1.733,"OPEN,ACCESS,SERIES,MRI,DATA,RISK",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,

A fully automated algorithm for detection and localization of RM may eliminate the observer variability in the clinical workflow. Method In this paper, we describe a fully automated methodology for accurate detection and segmentation of RM from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images. We first determine the boundaries of the kidneys on the CECT images utilizing a convolutional neural network-based method to be used as a region of interest to search for RM. We then employ a homogenous U-Net-based ensemble learning model to identify and delineate RM. We used an institutional dataset comprised of CECT images in 315 patients to train and evaluate the proposed method. We compared results of our method to those of three-dimensional (3D) U-Net for RM localization and further evaluated our algorithm using the kidney tumor segmentation (KiTS19) challenge dataset. Results The developed algorithm reported a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 95.79% +/- 5.16% and 96.25 +/- 3.37 (mean +/- standard deviation) for segmentation accuracy of kidney boundary from 125 and 60 test images from institutional and KiTS19 datasets, respectively. Using our method, RM were detected in 125 and 52 test cases, which corresponds to 100% and 86.67% sensitivity at patient level in institutional and KiTS19 test images. Our ensemble method for RM localization yielded a mean DSC of 88.65% +/- 7.31% and 87.91% +/- 6.82% on the institutional and KiTS19 test datasets, respectively. The mean DSC for RM delineation from CECT institutional test images using 3D U-Net was 85.95% +/- 1.46%. Conclusion We describe a method for automated localization of RM using CECT images. Our results are important in terms of clinical perspective as fully automated detection of RM is a fundamental step for further diagnosis of cystic vs solid RM and eventually benign vs malignant solid RM, that has not been reported previously.","contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images,ensemble learning system,renal mass,U-Net",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"CT,TEXTURE,ANALYSIS,CELL,CARCINOMA,KIDNEY,SEGMENTATION,DIFFERENTIATION,ANGIOMYOLIPOMA,ULTRASOUND,DIAGNOSIS,FEATURES,CYST,FAT",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

However, segmentation performance is limited by the blurry soft tissue boundaries. In this study, we aimed to present a hybrid solution for uterus, rectum, bladder, and levator ani muscle segmentation by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a level set method. Methods We used 24 sagittal pelvic floor magnetic resonance (MR) series from six anterior vaginal prolapse and six posterior vaginal prolapse subjects (a total 528 MR images). The stress MR images were performed both at rest and at maximal Valsalva. We assigned 264 images for training, 132 images for validation, and 132 images for testing. A CNN was designed by introducing a multi-resolution features pyramid module (MRFP) into an encoder-decoder model. Depth separable convolution and pretraining were used to improve model convergence. Multiclass cross entropy loss and multiclass Dice loss were used for model training. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD) were used for evaluating the segmentation results. To prove the effectiveness of our model, we compared it with advanced segmentation methods including Deeplabv3+, U-Net, and FCN-8s. The ablation study was designed to quantify the contributions of MRFP, the encoder network, and pretraining. Besides, we investigated the working mechanism of MRFP in the segmentation network by comparing our model with three of its variants. Finally, the level set method was used to improve the CNN model further. Results Dice loss showed better segmentation performance than multiclass cross entropy loss. MRFP was efficacious for different encoder networks. With MRFP, U-Net and U-Net-X (X represents Xception encoder network) have improved the DSC, on average by 6.8 and 5.3 points. Compared with different CNN models, our model achieved the highest average DSC of 65.6 points and the lowest average ASD of 2.9 mm. With the level set method, the DSC of our model improved to 69.4 points. Conclusions MRFP proved to be effective in addressing the blurry soft tissue boundary problem on pelvic floor MR images.

In AI, this includes the development of computer programs that can beat a grandmaster at GO or outperform human radiologists at cancer detection. A great deal of these technological developments are directly related to progress in artificial neural networks-initially inspired by our knowledge about how the brain carries out computation. In parallel, neuroscience has also experienced significant advances in understanding the brain. For example, in the field of spatial navigation, knowledge about the mechanisms and brain regions involved in neural computations of cognitive maps-an internal representation of space-recently received the Nobel Prize in medicine. Much of the recent progress in neuroscience has partly been due to the development of technology used to record from very large populations of neurons in multiple regions of the brain with exquisite temporal and spatial resolution in behaving animals. With the advent of the vast quantities of data that these techniques allow us to collect there has been an increased interest in the intersection between AI and neuroscience, many of these intersections involve using AI as a novel tool to explore and analyze these large data sets. However, given the common initial motivation point-to understand the brain-these disciplines could be more strongly linked. Currently much of this potential synergy is not being realized. We propose that spatial navigation is an excellent area in which these two disciplines can converge to help advance what we know about the brain. In this review, we first summarize progress in the neuroscience of spatial navigation and reinforcement learning. We then turn our attention to discuss how spatial navigation has been modeled using descriptive, mechanistic, and normative approaches and the use of AI in such models. Next, we discuss how AI can advance neuroscience, how neuroscience can advance AI, and the limitations of these approaches. We finally conclude by highlighting promising lines of research in which spatial navigation can be the point of intersection between neuroscience and AI and how this can contribute to the advancement of the understanding of intelligent behavior.","neuroscience,artificial intelligence,spatial navigation,deep learning,reinforcement learning,memory,learning",Review,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Mathematical & Computational Biology,Neurosciences & Neurology",,2.909,"HEAD,DIRECTION,SIGNALS,GRID,CELLS,PATH-INTEGRATION,NEURAL-NETWORKS,HIPPOCAMPAL,COGNITION,PARIETAL,CORTEX,MEMORY,MODEL",FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7399088,

A Niblack's algorithm-based technique employed on atomic force microscopy images provides geometry inputs for the FEA model, while the viscoelastic master curves of the soft matrix are obtained via a combination of dynamic mechanical analysis data and molecular dynamic (MD) estimations. In this microstructural image-based FEA framework, we introduce an interphase area of altered properties between the hard and soft domains. Both spatial and property distributions of this interphase area affect the viscoelastic response of the copolymer system. To quantitatively investigate the impact of structural and property features of the interphase on the energy storage and dissipation of a system during linear perturbation, we develop a statistical descriptor representation of the interphase region related to physical parameters. Utilizing decision-tree and random forest concepts from machine learning, we apply a ranking algorithm to identify the most significant features for four different mechanical response descriptors. Results show that the total interphase volume fraction and shifting factor distributions in the interphase area dominate the magnitude of the tan delta peak, whereas the magnitudes of the shifting factors primarily affect the tan delta peak location in frequency space. This method allows us to readily identify the dominant features impacting individual properties and paves the way for material design of hard-soft block copolymer systems.","polymer,viscoelasticity,interphase",Article,"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS, 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",Materials Science,,2.584,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,GLASS-TRANSITION,TEMPERATURE,POLYMER,NANOCOMPOSITES,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,ELASTIC-MODULUS,POLYUREA,REINFORCEMENT,INTERPHASE,MODEL,COMPOSITES",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH,,

It is generally assumed that CFC can play a crucial role in perception, memory, and attention. In this study, two new indices for evaluating frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) through generalized linear model (GLM) and linear regression method were introduced and investigated along with other CFC indices. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during covert visual attention tasks to find out the CFC index capability so as to distinguish different states in the mentioned tasks. To this end, machine learning algorithms were used and four various types of CFC, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), phase-phase coupling (PPC), amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), and frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) in recorded signals were considered as inputs for classifiers. The results demonstrated that the proposed method used for evaluating FAC through linear regression can provide more information about the different states in two covert attention tasks using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by classification performance of 94.21% and 90.54% in color and direction tasks, respectively. Also, FAC that used a GLM model and PAC had a higher performance compared with PPC and AAC in color task (90.74 and 92.24% against 83.21 and 86.22). We can conclude that CFC can encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli in covert attention tasks and can be used as an acceptable alternative for the time-frequency features of brain signals.","Electroencephalography,Cross-frequency coupling,Covert visual attention,Frequency-amplitude coupling",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,TOP-DOWN,MODULATION,WORKING-MEMORY,BRAIN,OSCILLATIONS,THETA-OSCILLATIONS,PREFRONTAL,CORTEX,FUNCTIONAL-ROLE,PHASE,GAMMA,SIGNALS",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

These high impact shovel loading operations (HISLO) result in large dynamic impact force at truck bed surface. This impact force generates high-frequency shockwaves which expose the operator to whole body vibrations (WBVs). These WBVs cause serious injuries and fatalities to operators in mining operations. The present work focuses on developing solution technology for minimizing impact force on truck bed surface, which is the cause of these WBVs. The proposed technology involves modifying the truck bed structural design through the addition of synthetic rubber. Detailed experiments, with the technology implementation, showed a reduction of impact force by 22.60% and 23.83%, during the first and second shovel passes, respectively, which in turn reduced the WBV levels by 25.56% and 26.95% during the first and second shovel passes, respectively, at the operator's seat.

Methods A two-step task-based residual network ((TRN)-R-2) is proposed to automatically identify inherent landmarks in prostate PTV. The input to the (TRN)-R-2 is the pretreatment CBCT images of the patient, and the output is the deep learning-identified landmarks in the PTV. To ensure robust PTV localization, the (TRN)-R-2 model is trained by using over thousand sets of CT images with labeled landmarks, each of the CTs corresponds to a different scenario of patient position and/or anatomy distribution generated by synthetically changing the planning CT (pCT) image. The changes, including translation, rotation, and deformation, represent vast possible clinical situations of anatomy variations during a course of radiation therapy (RT). The trained patient-specific (TRN)-R-2 model is tested by using 240 CBCTs from six patients. The testing CBCTs consists of 120 original CBCTs and 120 synthetic CBCTs. The synthetic CBCTs are generated by applying rotation/translation transformations to each of the original CBCT. Results The systematic/random setup errors between the model prediction and the reference are found to be <0.25/2.46 mm and 0.14/1.41 degrees in translation and rotation dimensions, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient between model prediction and the reference is higher than 0.94 in translation and rotation dimensions.

However, due to uncertainties in both patient setup and relative stopping power (RSP) calculation, margins are added to the treatment volume during treatment planning, leading to higher doses to normal tissues. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are taken daily before treatment; however, the poor image quality of CBCT limits the use of these images for online dose calculation. In this work, we use a deep-learning-based method to predict RSP maps from daily CBCT images, allowing for online dose calculation in a step toward adaptive radiation therapy.
Methods: Twenty-three head-and-neck cancer patients were simulated using a Siemens TwinBeam dual-energy CT (DECT) scanner. Mixed-energy scans (equivalent to a 120 kVp single-energy CT scan) were converted to RSP maps for treatment planning. Cone-beam computed tomography images were taken on the first day of treatment, and the planning RSP maps were registered to these images. A deep learning network based on a cycle-GAN architecture, relying on a compound loss function designed for structural and contrast preservation, was then trained to create an RSP map from a CBCT image. Leave-one-out and holdout cross validations were used for evaluation, and mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) were used to quantify the differences between the CT-based and CBCT-based RSP maps. The proposed method was compared to a deformable image registration-based method which was taken as the ground truth and two other deep learning methods. For one patient who underwent resimulation, the new planning RSP maps and CBCT images were used for further evaluation and validation.
Results: The CBCT-based RSP generation method was evaluated on 23 head-and-neck cancer patients. From leave-one-out testing, the MAE between CT-based and CBCT-based RSP was 0.06 +/- 0.01 and the ME was -0.01 +/- 0.01. The proposed method statistically outperformed the comparison DL methods in terms of MAE and ME when compared to the planning CT. In terms of dose comparison, the mean gamma passing rate at 3%/3 mm was 94% when three-dimensional (3D) gamma index was calculated per plan and 96% when gamma index was calculated per field.
Conclusions: The proposed method provides sufficiently accurate RSP map generation from CBCT images, allowing for evaluation of daily dose based on CBCT and possibly allowing for CBCT-guided adaptive treatment planning for IMPT.

Conventional colorimetric cocaine tests involve handling of the unknown material and are prone to false-positive reactions on common pharmaceuticals used as cutting agents. This study demonstrates the novel application of 740-1070 nm small-wavelength-range near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to confidently detect cocaine in case samples. Multistage machine learning algorithms are used to exploit the limited spectral features and predict not only the presence of cocaine but also the concentration and sample composition. A model based on more than 10,000 spectra from case samples yielded 97% true-positive and 98% true-negative results. The practical applicability is shown in more than 100 case samples not included in the model design. One of the most exciting aspects of this on-scene approach is that the model can almost instantly adapt to changes in the illicit-drug market by updating metadata with results from subsequent confirmatory laboratory analyses. These results demonstrate that advanced machine learning strategies applied on limited-range NIR spectra from economic handheld sensors can be a valuable procedure for rapid on-site detection of illicit substances by investigating officers. In addition to forensics, this interesting approach could be beneficial for screening and classification applications in the pharmaceutical, food-safety, and environmental domains.","cocaine,forensic illicit-drug analysis,indicative testing,k-nearest neighbors,near-infrared",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Chemistry,Pharmacology & Pharmacy",,,"SPECTROSCOPY,NIR,IDENTIFICATION",DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7590077?pdf=render,

We tackle two main challenges. (1) Carbody acceleration has to be used for WF detection, where signal-to-noise ratio is much lower than at axle box level and thus the WF detection is much more difficult. (2) ESs have very limited computation power and energy supply. To verify the proposed LightWFNet, the field data measured on a tank waggon under operational condition are used.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the capabilities of deep learning for the classification of dental occlusion using 3D images that has an exciting impact in several fields of dental anatomy. In present work, the 3D stereolithography (STL) files depicting the dental structures are converted to 2D histograms, using Absolute Angle Shape Distribution (AAD) technique, which are used as an input to deep or machine learning models for classification of dental structures based on the similarity of their shape features. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no solution has been proposed for classification of dental occlusion using deep learning. Thus, an attempt has been made to propose a classification technique for dental occlusion. Based on the experimental analysis, it has been revealed that the deep learning-based convolutional neural network along with AAD performs better as compared to other existing machine learning techniques, with maximum accuracy of 78.95% for occlusion classification.

In this study, the microstructures of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) atmospheric-plasma-sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coatings were regulated by choosing different kinds of spray powders, distances and power during processing. A terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system configurated transmission mode with an incidence angle of 0 degrees was employed to estimate terahertz properties of porous YSZ ceramic coatings, including refractive index, extinction coefficient and relative time-domain broadening ratio. The variation tendency of terahertz properties of YSZ ceramic coatings with different microstructure features (porosity, pore to crack ratio, pore size) were investigated. Principal component analysis (PCA) method was adopted to reduce the dimensions of refractive index and extinction coefficient spectra data at the range of 0.6-1.4 THz and to ensure that different terahertz properties could be treated as inputs with similar weights during modeling. Three models (multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation (BP) neural network and support vector machine (SVM)) were set up to conduct regression analysis. As a result, according to the contribution rates of eigenvectors, the top one principal component of refractive index spectra data and the top two principal components of extinction coefficient spectra data were selected as the model inputs. The correlation coefficient comparisons showed that the characterization accuracy of PCA-SVM reached by over 95% and outperformed the other models. Finally, this study proposed that THz nondestructive technology combined with machine learning technique is efficient and feasible for microstructural features characterization and has profound implications for the structure integrity of TBCs evaluation in gas turbine blades.","Thermal barrier coatings,APS,Microstructural features,Terahertz,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Materials Science,Physics",,3.958,"IN-FLIGHT,BEHAVIOR,NONDESTRUCTIVE,EVALUATION,POROSITY,THICKNESS,SCIENCE",SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY,,
24,A statistical shape modeling approach for predicting subject-specific human skull from head surface,58,10,2355-2373,"Tan-Nhu Nguyen,Vi-Do Tran,Ho-Quang Nguyen,Tien-Tuan Dao","Nguyen TN,Tran VD,Nguyen HQ,Dao TT",Dao TT,10.1007/s11517-020-02219-4,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Human skull is an important body structure for jaw movement and facial mimic simulations. Surface head can be reconstructed using 3D scanners in a straightforward way. However, internal skull is challenging to be generated when only external information is available. Very few studies in the literature focused on the skull generation from outside head information, especially in a subject-specific manner with a complete skull. Consequently, this present study proposes a novel process for predicting a subject-specific skull with full details from a given head surface using a statistical shape modeling approach. Partial least squared regression (PLSR)-based method was used. A CT image database of 209 subjects (genders-160 males and 49 females; ages-34-88 years) was used for learning head-to-skull relationship. Heads and skulls were reconstructed from CT images to extract head/skull feature points, head/skull feature distances, head-skull thickness, and head/skull volume descriptors for the learning process. A hyperparameter turning process was performed to determine the optimal numbers of head/skull feature points, PLSR components, deformation control points, and appropriate learning strategies for our learning problem. Two learning strategies (point-to-thickness with/without volume descriptor and distance-to-thickness with/without volume descriptor) were proposed. Moreover, a 10-fold cross-validation procedure was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed learning strategies. Finally, the best and worst reconstructed skulls were analyzed based on the best learning strategy with its optimal parameters. The optimal number of head/skull feature points and deformation control points are 2300 and 1300 points, respectively. The optimal number of PLSR components ranges from 4 to 8 for all learning configurations. Cross-validation showed that grand means and standard deviations of the point-to-thickness, point-to-thickness with volumes, distance-to-thickness, and distance-to-thickness with volumes learning configurations are 2.48 +/- 0.27 mm, 2.46 +/- 0.19 mm, 2.46 +/- 0.15 mm, and 2.48 +/- 0.22 mm, respectively. Thus, the distance-to-thickness is the best learning configuration for our head-to-skull prediction problem. Moreover, the mean Hausdorff distances are 2.09 +/- 0.15 mm and 2.64 +/- 0.26 mm for the best and worst predicted skull, respectively. A novel head-to-skull prediction process based on the PLSR method was developed and evaluated. This process allows, for the first time, predicting 3D subject-specific human skulls from head surface information with a very good accuracy level. As perspective, the proposed head-to-skull prediction process will be integrated into our real-time computer-aided vision system for facial animation and rehabilitation.

As the first step of the diagnosis, the accuracy of tongue image segmentation directly affects the subsequent diagnosis. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been applied for tongue image segmentation and achieve promising results. However, these methods usually work well on one dataset and degenerate significantly on different distributed datasets. To deal with this issue, we propose a framework named Iterative cross-domain tongue segmentation in the study. First, we train a tongue image segmentation U-Net model on the source dataset. Then, we propose a tongue assessment filter to select satisfying samples based on predictions of the U-Net model from the target dataset. Following, we fine-tune the model on the selected samples along with the source domain. Finally, we iterate between the filtering and the fine-tuning steps until the model is converged. Experimental results on two tongue datasets show that our proposed method can improve the dice score on the target domain from 70.11% to 98.26%, as well as outperform state-of-the-art comparing methods.","domain adaptation,tongue image segmentation,U-Net",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Computer Science,,1.471,ALGORITHM,CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE,,

Typical classification models hardly deal with artifacts and low discrimination of landmark regions by using only local image information, while regression models suffer from ambiguity between random samples and label, also the imbalance of samples. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a left ventricle landmark localization and identification method in cardiac MRI based on deep distance metric learning and CNN (convolutional neural network) regression. The method includes sample generation and regression stages, where super-pixel over-segmentation and unsupervised deep metric learning are integrated to extract the embedding information of local images, then a dual-channel salient sample mining module is designed by integrating specific super-pixel patches and grid patches extracted by the embedded triplet network. The weights of this triplet network are fed to build the CNN regression model, and the salient samples are employed to predict the landmark coordinate point cloud clusters. Furthermore, the centroid of each point cloud cluster is refined as landmark by Mean Shift iteration. The proposed method and close related methods were thoroughly evaluated on the CAP (cardiac atlas project) data set, and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the competitive accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art classification and regression-based models.

It is more assistance for radiologists reflections on the disease based on the pathogenesis when the lesion area and its adjacent structures are detected. Obviously, the multiple structures of the spine are directly interdependent and influential, and the multi-tasks under a deep convolutional neural network framework can also influence each other. Multi-task joint optimization in the spinal global mode is a direct outlet to seek the dynamic balance of the above potential correlation. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-task Multi-structure Correlation Learning Network (MMCL-Net) for the detection, segmentation, and classification (normal, slight, marked, and severe) of three types of spine structure: disc, vertebra, and neural foramen simultaneously. And the model is locally optimized to achieve a more stable dynamic equilibrium state. Extensive experiments on T1/T2-weighted MR scans from 200 subjects demonstrate that MMCL-Net achieves high performance with mAP of 0.9187, the classification accuracy of 90.67%, and dice coefficient of 90.60%.

In fMRI studies, including most machine learning studies seeking to distinguish ASD from typical developing (TD) samples, cohorts differing in gender and symptom severity composition are often treated statistically as one 'ASD group.' Using resting-state functional connectivity (FC) data, we implemented random forest to build diagnostic classifiers in four ASD samples including a total of 656 participants (N-ASD = 306,N-TD = 350, ages 6-18). Groups were manipulated to titrate heterogeneity of gender and symptom severity and partially overlapped. Each sample differed on inclusionary criteria: (1) all genders, unrestricted severity range; (2) only male participants, unrestricted severity; (3) all genders, higher severity only; and (4) only male participants, higher severity. Each set consisted of 200 participants per group (ASD, TD; matched on age and head motion): 160 for training and 40 for validation. FMRI time series from 237 regions of interest (ROIs) were Pearson correlated in a 237 x 237 FC matrix, and classifiers were built using random forest in training samples. Classification accuracies in validation samples were 62.5%, 65%, 70%, and 73.75%, respectively, for samples 1-4. Connectivity within cingulo-opercular task control (COTC) network, and between COTC ROIs and default mode and dorsal attention network contributed overall most informative features, but features differed across sets. Findings suggest that diagnostic classifiers vary depending on ASD sample composition. Specifically, greater homogeneity of samples regarding gender and symptom severity enhances classifier performance.

However, effective cardiac auscultation requires trained physicians whose work is tough, laborious and subjective. The objective of this study is to develop an automatic classification method for anomaly (normal vs. abnormal) detection of PCG recordings without any segmentation of heart sound signals. Hybrid signal processing and artificial intelligence tools, including tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks, are utilized to extract representative features in order to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of PCG system caused by heart disease. First, heart sound signal is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Second, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the heart sound signal into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the heart sound signal's energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. They are selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear PCG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in PCG system dynamics between normal and abnormal heart sound signals. Finally, PhysioNet/CinC Challenge heart sound database is used for evaluation and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique method is applied to balance the datasets. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed features with dynamical neural networks based classifier yield classification performance with sensitivity, specificity, overall score and accuracy values of 97.73% 98.05%, 97.89%, and 97.89%, respectively.

Herein, we address the simultaneous monitoring of C-V and C-P from a single impedance spectrum without using recognizing elements by combining a multidimensional sensor and machine learning models. This multidetermination is essential for diagnostic accuracy because of the heterogeneous composition of EVs and their molecular cargoes both within the tumor itself and among patients.

The motivation for machine learning models is based on the orders of magnitude speedup compared to DFT calculations or experimental characterization. High-quality experimental materials data would be ideal for training these models; unfortunately, experimental data are typically costly to obtain. As a result, experimental databases are often smaller and less cohesive. Using band gap, we demonstrate how an ensemble learning approach allows us to efficiently model experimental data by combining models trained on otherwise disparate computational and experimental data. This approach demonstrates how disparate data sources can be incorporated into the modeling of sparsely represented experimental data.

As dermatology belongs to this field, it has the potential to play a pioneering role in the use of AI. Objective The current use of AI for the diagnosis and follow-up of dermatoses is reviewed and the future potential of these technologies is discussed. Materials and methods This article is based on a selective review of the literature using Embase and MEDLINE and the keywords ""psoriasis"", ""eczema"", ""dermatoses"" and ""acne"" combined with ""artificial intelligence"", ""machine learning"", ""deep learning"", ""neural network"", ""computer-guided"", ""supervised machine learning"" or ""unsupervised machine learning"" were searched. Results In comparison to examiner-dependent intra- and interindividually fluctuating scores for the assessment of inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. the Psoriasis Areas Severity Index [PASI] and body surface area [BSA]), AI-based algorithms can potentially offer reproducible, standardized evaluations of these scores. Whereas promising algorithms have already been developed for the diagnosis of psoriasis, there is currently only scarce work on the use of AI in the context of eczema. Conclusions The latest developments in this field show the enormous potential of AI-based diagnostics and follow-up of dermatological clinical pictures by means of an autonomous computer-based image analysis.

After surgical biopsy, 325 cases were confirmed to be benign and 437 cases were confirmed to be papillary thyroid carcinoma. Image annotation marks were removed, and missing regions were recovered using neighboring parenchyme. To reduce overfitting of the deep learning model, we applied data augmentation, global average pooling. And 4-fold cross-validation was performed to detect overfitting. We employed a transfer learning method with the pretrained deep learning model VGG16. The average area under the curve of the model was 0.916, and its specificity and sensitivity were 0.70 and 0.92, respectively.

For efficiently classifying the breast tumors, the conventional CAD system designs use hand-crafted features. However, these features are not robust to the variations in size, shape and orientation of the tumors resulting in lower sensitivity. Thus deep feature extraction and classification of breast ultrasound images have recently gained attention from research community. The deep networks come with an advantage of directly learning the representative features from the images. However, these networks are difficult to train from scratch if the representative training data is small in size. Therefore transfer learning approach for deep feature extraction and classification of medical images has been widely used. In the present work the performance of four pre-trained convolutional neural networks VGG-19, SqueezeNet, ResNet-18 and GoogLeNet has been evaluated for differentiating between benign and malignant tumor types. From the results of the experiments, it is noted that CAD system design using GoogLeNet architecture for deep feature extraction followed by correlation based feature selection and fuzzy feature selection using ANFC-LH yields highest accuracy of 98.0% with individual class accuracy value of 100% and 96% for benign and malignant classes respectively.

Methods We propose DL-ESPIRiT, an unrolled neural network architecture that utilizes an extended coil sensitivity model to address SENSE-related field-of-view (FOV) limitations in previously proposed deep learning-based reconstruction frameworks. Additionally, we propose a novel neural network design based on (2+1)D spatiotemporal convolutions to produce more accurate dynamic MRI reconstructions than conventional 3D convolutions. The network is trained on fully sampled 2D cardiac cine datasets collected from 11 healthy volunteers with IRB approval. DL-ESPIRiT is compared against a state-of-the-art parallel imaging and compressed sensing method known asl1-ESPIRiT. The reconstruction accuracy of both methods is evaluated on retrospectively undersampled datasets (R = 12) with respect to standard image quality metrics as well as automatic deep learning-based segmentations of left ventricular volumes. Feasibility of DL-ESPIRiT is demonstrated on two prospectively undersampled datasets acquired in a single heartbeat per slice. Results The (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT method produces higher fidelity image reconstructions when compared tol1-ESPIRiT reconstructions with respect to standard image quality metrics (P< .001). As a result of improved image quality, segmentations made from (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT images are also more accurate than segmentations froml1-ESPIRiT images. Conclusions DL-ESPIRiT synergistically combines a robust parallel imaging model and deep learning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions of retrospectively undersampled 2D cardiac cine data acquired with reduced FOV.

A calculative culture comprises a specific set of practices and norms concerning data and model use in an organizational setting. Drawing on interviews with model users (data scientists, software developers, traders, and portfolio managers) working in algorithmic securities trading, I argue that the introduction of complex machine-learning models changes the dynamics in calculative cultures, which leads to a displacement of human judgment in quantitative finance. In this paper, I distinguish between three calculative cultures: (1) an idealistic culture of undivided trust in models, (2) a pragmatic culture of skepticism toward model accuracy, and (3) a pragmatic idealist culture of early stage skepticism and implementation and production-phase idealism. Based on the empirical material, the analysis engages with examples of each of the three calculative cultures.

First, crack images collected from the lab, earthquake sites, and the Internet are resized, labeled manually, and augmented to make a dataset (1200 subimages with 256 x 256 x 3 resolutions in total). Then, an improved Unet-based method called CrackUnet is proposed for automated pixel-level crack detection. A new loss function named generalized dice loss is adopted to detect cracks more accurately.

In most previous studies, objective fabric smoothness appearance evaluation is defined as a general pattern classification problem. However, the labels in this problem exhibit a natural ordering. Nominal classification ignores the ordinal information, which may cause overfitting in model training. In addition, for the existence of subjective errors, measurement errors, manual errors, etc., the labels in the data might be noisy, which has been rarely discussed previously. This paper proposes an ordinal classification framework based on label noise estimation (OCF-LNE) to objectively evaluate the fabric smoothness appearance degree, which takes the ordinal information and noise of the label in the training data into consideration. The OCF-LNE uses the basic classifier in pre-training as a label noise estimator, and uses the estimated label noise to adjust the labels in further training. The adjusted labels can introduce the ordinal constrain implicitly and reduce the negative impact of label noise in model training. Within a 10 x 10 nested cross-validation, the proposed OCF-LNE achieves 82.86%, 94.29%, and 100% average accuracies under errors of 0, 0.5, and 1 degree, respectively. Experiments on different fabric image features and basic classification models verify the effectiveness of the OCF-LNE. In addition, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for fabric smoothness evaluation and ordinal classification.

This is owing to the extraordinary tunability of their physical and chemical properties via defect engineering. The feasibility and the stability of a defect, such as a substitutional dopant, in the host lattice is usually obtained via experiments and/or through detailed quantum mechanical calculations. Both of these conventional routes are expensive and time consuming. An alternative is a data-driven machine learning (ML)-based approach. In this work, we have applied ML techniques to identify the factors that influence defect formation energy, which is an important measure of the stability of the defects, in perovskite oxides. Using 13 elemental properties as features and random forest regression, we demonstrate a systematic approach to down-selecting from the larger set of features to those that are important, establishing a framework for accurate predictions of the defect formation energy. We quantitatively show that the most important factors that control the dopant stability are the dopant ionic size, heat of formation, effective tolerance factor, and oxidation state. Our work reveals previously unknown correlations, chemical trends, and the interplay between stability and underlying chemistries. Hence, these results showcase the efficacy of ML tools in identifying and quantifying different feature-dependencies and provide a promising route toward dopant selection in the perovskites.

Deep CNN transferred multiple instance learning (DCT-MIL) is proposed to identify COPD via CT images. After the lung is divided into eight sections along the axial direction, one random axial CT image is taken out from each section as one instance. With one instance as the input, the activations of neural layers of AlexNet trained by natural images are extracted as features. After dimension reduction through principle component analysis, features of all instances are input into three MIL methods: Citation k-Nearest-Neighbor (Citation-KNN), multiple instance support vector machine, and expectation-maximization diverse density.

Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations. In this work, a milling diagnosis using AI approaches has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honeycomb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honeycomb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. In this approach cutting forces are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.

The characteristic parameters, including the Mo equivalence and the cluster-formula approach, are implemented into the ML to ensure the accuracy of prediction, in which the former parameter represents the BCC-beta structural stability, and the latter reflects the interactions among elements expressed with a composition formula. Both auxiliary gradient-boosting regression tree and genetic algorithm methods were adopted to deal with the optimization problem in the ML model. This cluster-formula-embedded ML can not only predict alloy property in the forward design, but also design and optimize alloy compositions with desired properties in multicomponent systems efficiently and accurately. By setting different objective functions, several new beta-Ti alloys with either the lowestE(E = 48 GPa) or a specificE(E = 55 and 60 GPa) were predicted by ML and then validated by a series of experiments, including the microstructural characterization and mechanical measurements.

This study aimed to investigate the risk factors that could predict IHD during pheochromocytoma surgery by data mining. Method Relief-F was used to select the most important features. The accuracies of seven data mining models (CART, C4.5, C5.0, and C5.0 boosted), random forest algorithm, Naive Bayes and logistic regression were compared, the cross-validation, hold-out, and bootstrap methods were used in the validation phase. The accuracy of these models was calculated independently by dividing the training and the test sets. Receiver-Operating Characteristic curves were used to obtain the area under curve (AUC).

It results in difficulties of early mortality prediction in the rural areas lack of professional laboratorians and medical laboratory equipment. To improve the efficiency, accuracy, and applicability of mortality prediction in the remote areas, a novel mortality prediction method based on machine learning algorithms is proposed, which only uses non-invasive parameters readily available from ordinary monitors and manual measurement. A new feature selection method based on the Bayes error rate is developed to select valuable features.

The requisite manual examinations to detect these abnormalities are costly and time consuming. The rapid and accurate detection of kidney abnormalities has emerged as a focus of computer-aided medical research. Traditional methods work on images of kidneys and rely on hand-crafted features to identify abnormal symptoms as independent classes that lack generalization to different kidney diseases. In this study, an automated architecture to detect various kidney abnormalities is proposed that works on abdominal ultrasound images using convolutional neural networks. Our model consists of three components: the first selects appropriate ultrasound images of kidneys, the second is a detection model used to locate the area occupied by the kidney in the given image, and the third component using the multi-feature fusion neural network (Mf-Net) discriminates normal and abnormal kidneys, by determining whether there are abnormal symptoms in images. The detection model is combined with a weighted ensemble method to improve performance. A multi-feature fusion layer is also designed in the Mf-Net to extract distinctive features for multiple views of images. The three components work together to automatically recognize abnormalities associated with kidneys. A large dataset containing 3,722 abdominal ultrasound images with classification and localization annotations is established to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble detection model performs best with an average TPF of 98.0%, and the Mf-Net achieves an average classification accuracy of 94.67%. The obtained high classification and detection accuracy demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for recognizing kidney abnormalities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The best ensemble model build, E13, was obtained with good statistical parameters for the learning series, namely, the following: accuracy = 0.840, sensibility = 0.890, specificity = 0.761, Matthew's correlation coefficient = 0.660, and area under the ROC curve = 0.904. The model was also satisfactorily evaluated with Y-scrambling test, and repeated k-fold cross-validation and repeated k-holdout validation. In addition, an exhaustive external validation was also carried out by using two test sets and five external test sets, with an average accuracy value equal to 0.854 (+/- 0.062) and a coverage equal to 98.4% according to its applicability domain. A statistical comparison of the performance of the E13 model, with regard to results and tools (e.g., Padel DDPredictor Software, Deep Learning DILIserver, and Vslead) reported in the literature, was also performed. In general, E13 presented the best global performance in all experiments. The sum of the ranking differences procedure provided a very similar grouping pattern to that of the M-ANOVA statistical analysis, where E13 was identified as the best model for DILI predictions. A noncommercial and fully cross-platform software for the DILI prediction was also developed, which is freely available at http://tomocomd.com/apps/ptoxtra. This software was used for the screening of seven data sets, containing natural products, leads, toxic materials, and FDA approved drugs, to assess the usefulness of the QSAR models in the DILI labeling of organic substances; it was found that 50-92% of the evaluated molecules are positive-DILI compounds. All in all, it can be stated that the E13 model is a relevant method for the prediction of DILI risk in humans, as it shows the best results among all of the methods analyzed.","IN-SILICO MODELS,DEVELOPMENT KIT CDK,SOURCE JAVA LIBRARY,APPLICABILITY DOMAIN,HEPATOTOXICITY,INJURY,DESCRIPTORS,VALIDATION,PROGRESS,INDEXES",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Chemistry,Toxicology",,4.142,"IN-SILICO,MODELS,DEVELOPMENT,KIT,CDK,SOURCE,JAVA,LIBRARY,APPLICABILITY,DOMAIN,HEPATOTOXICITY,INJURY,DESCRIPTORS,VALIDATION,PROGRESS,INDEXES",CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY,,

However, an appropriate feature selection could improve its reliability. Differently from conventional feature reduction methods, we hypothesised that applying feature reduction first and then augmenting the reduced feature space could improve classification performance further. Thus, a novel two-stage Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based feature transformation method, which involves both feature reduction and augmentation (2-Tra-GA), was developed, tested and validated. This 2-Tra-GA was later coupled to ML-based classifiers for a prognostic prediction. Clinical data with nineteen (N = 19) features on 32O patients with hepatitis obtained from the University of California-Irvine ML repository were utilised. When tested on these data, the GA-based feature reduction resulted in a reduced set with fifteen (N=15) features that led to the highest classification accuracy and reliability. Augmenting the reduced set by adding transformed features via an interpolation method (N=32 features in total, 15 reduced and 17 transformed) further improved the classification performance. Additionally, the performance of this novel hybrid algorithm was evaluated against classifiers alike and published studies. Applying feature reduction, then augmenting only such relevant features improved classification performance and computational efficiency, also over conventional wrapper-based feature selection methods. Thus, a novel hybrid DSS to improve the reliability of the prediction of prognosis for hepatitis is proposed. Findings also support the application of the proposed hybrid method to improve clinical decision making. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, these concrete mixes have a higher carbon footprint and it is vital to consider the embodied carbon of the HSC and UHSC due to the massive consumption throughout the world. In this study, embodied carbon analysis, using machine learning algorithms has been carried out to minimize the carbon footprint of concrete without jeopardizing the mechanical properties of the concrete. Machine learning models are developed using experimental results in the literature and used to predict the compressive strength of concrete using the constituent materials. Using the experimental data and machine-learned models for mix designs, embodied carbon emissions were calculated. It is shown that there can be many mix compositions which have the same compressive strength while having significantly different embodied carbon values. Based on experimental and machine learned mix designs, an equation to predict the average embodied carbon value for concrete mixes is proposed. The study suggested proposed intervals for the benchmark function in order to propose a region where the embodied carbon value of a concrete mix should lie while achieving the desired compressive strength. Finally, it is shown that machine learning can be used successfully to identify the high strength concrete mixes while minimizing the embodied carbon value of that mix composition.

We present the first image semantic segmentation solution for the computer-aided detection ofH. pyloriin WSIs. The solution only requires polygon annotations as weak supervision, which roughly, instead of pixel-level accurately, label theH. pyloriinfected areas in WSIs. We propose a new weakly supervised multi-task learning framework (WSMLF) that aims to improve the segmentation performance by more effectively exploiting the weak supervision. To make more effective usage of the weak supervision, we extract multiple inaccurate targets representing different modes of the true target from the available weak annotations. For improvement of the segmentation performance, we design a weakly supervised multi-task learning algorithm that can automatically learn from the weighted summarization of the extracted multiple inaccurate targets. These two advances constitute the resulting technique WSMLF. Introducing the proposed WSMLF to several common deep image semantic segmentation approaches for the detection ofH. pyloriin WSIs, we observe that WSMLF can enable these approaches to achieve more reasonable segmentation results, which eventually improve the detection performance ofH. pyloriby at most 6%.

The tissue collected from patients who undergo radical prostatectomy provides a unique opportunity to correlate histopathology images of the prostate with preoperative MRI to accurately map the extent of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI. We seek to develop an open-source, easy-to-use platform to align presurgical MRI and histopathology images of resected prostates in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to create accurate cancer labels on MRI. Methods Here, we introduceRAdiologyPathologySpatialOpen-Source multi-DimensionalIntegration (RAPSODI), the first open-source framework for the registration of radiology and pathology images. RAPSODI relies on three steps. First, it creates a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the histopathology specimen as a digital representation of the tissue before gross sectioning. Second, RAPSODI registers corresponding histopathology and MRI slices. Third, the optimized transforms are applied to the cancer regions outlined on the histopathology images to project those labels onto the preoperative MRI. Results We tested RAPSODI in a phantom study where we simulated various conditions, for example, tissue shrinkage during fixation. Our experiments showed that RAPSODI can reliably correct multiple artifacts. We also evaluated RAPSODI in 157 patients from three institutions that underwent radical prostatectomy and have very different pathology processing and scanning.

This work proposes a novel method to automatically identify AIFs in computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) datasets using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Methods One-hundred CTP and 100 PWI datasets of acute ischemic stroke patients were available for model development and evaluation. For each modality, 50 datasets were used for CNN training and 20 for validation using manually selected AIFs and non-arterial tissue concentration time curves. Model evaluation was performed using the remaining 30 independent validation datasets from each modality with manual AIF selections provided by two experts as ground truth. Additionally, AIFs were also extracted using an established automatic shape-based algorithm for comparison purposes. The extracted AIFs were compared using normalized cross-correlation and shape features as well as using the Dice similarity metric and volume of the corresponding hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) lesions. Results The cross-correlation values comparing the manual AIFs and those extracted by the proposed CNN method were significantly greater than those comparing the manual AIFs to the shape-based comparison method. Likewise, hypoperfusion lesions generated using the manually selected AIFs and CNN-based AIFs showed higher Dice values compared to hypoperfusion lesions generated using the comparison AIF extraction method. Shape features for AIFs generated by the proposed method did not differ significantly from the manual AIFs, with the exception that the CNN-derived AIFs for the PWI datasets showed marginally greater peak heights. Conclusion Deep convolutional neural network models are viable for the automatic extraction of the AIF from CTP and PWI datasets.","ischemic stroke,machine learning,perfusion imaging",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"ACUTE,ISCHEMIC-STROKE,CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW,PENUMBRAL,FLOW,QUANTIFICATION,VALIDATION,LOCATION,MODEL,TOOL",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Delayed diagnosis will cause anemia, increased intracranial pressure, organ failure, and even lead to death. The current main trend in this area is to use deep learning (DL) for disease diagnosis. Extracting classification information from the digital pathology images by DL may realize the automated qualitative and quantitative analysis of NHL. Previously, DL has been used to classify NHL digital pathology images with some success. However, shortcomings still exist in the data preprocessing methods and feature extraction. Therefore, this paper presents a method for the classification of NHL subtypes based on the fusion of transfer learning (TL) and principal component analysis (PCA). Methods First, the NHL digital pathology images were preprocessed by image division and segmentation and then input into the transfer models for fine-tuning and feature extraction. Second, PCA was used to map the extracted features. Finally, a neural network was used as a classifier to classify the mapped features. During the fine-tuning of the transfer models, two methods, freezing all feature extraction layers and fine-tuning all layers, were employed to select the optimal model with the best classification result among all the preselected transfer models. On this basis, the use of freezing the layers' location was discussed and analyzed. Results The results show that the proposed method achieved average fivefold cross-validation accuracies of 100%, 99.73%, and 99.20% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumor, and each category has standard deviations 0.00, 0.53, and 0.65, respectively, in the NHL reference dataset. The overall classification accuracy for fivefold cross-validation is 98.93%, which is an increase of 1.26% compared to the latest reported methods, having a lower standard deviation (1.00). Conclusion The method proposed in this paper achieves a high classification accuracy and strong model generalization for the classification of NHL, which makes it possible to conduct intelligent classification of NHL in clinical practice. Our proposed method has definite clinical value and research significance.","computer-aided diagnosis (CAD),deep learning algorithm,lymphoma,principal component analysis (PCA),transfer learning (TL)",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DETECTION,DEEP,VALIDATION,DIAGNOSIS,AFRICA,CARE",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

This would contribute to improved PNI management and rehabilitation. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a novel surface EMG examination method for quantitatively evaluating traumatic upper-limb PNIs. Methods Experiments were conducted to collect surface EMG data from forearm muscles on both sides of seven male subjects during their performance of eight designated hand and wrist motion tasks. All participants were clinically diagnosed as unilateral traumatic upper-limb PNIs on the ulnar nerve, median nerve, or radial nerve. Ten healthy control participants were also enrolled in the study. A novel framework consisting of two modules was also proposed for data analysis. One module was first used to identify whether a PNI occurs on a tested forearm using a machine learning algorithm by extracting and classifying features from surface EMG data. The second module was then used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of injury on three individual nerves on the examined arm. Results The evaluation scores yielded by the proposed method were highly consistent with the clinical assessment decisions for three nerves of all 34 examined arms (7 x 2 + 10 x 2), with a sensitivity of 81.82%, specificity of 98.90%, and significate linear correlation (p< 0.05) in quantitative decision points between the proposed method and the routine clinical approach.

Indeed, in a considerable number of cases, Ta and T1 tumors look very similar under microscope, making the distinction very difficult even for experienced pathologists. Thus, there is an urgent need for a favoring system based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish between the two stages of bladder cancer. Methods A total of 1177 images of bladder tumor tissues stained by hematoxylin and eosin were collected by pathologists at University of Rochester Medical Center, which included 460 non-invasive (stage Ta) and 717 invasive (stage T1) tumors. Automatic pipelines were developed to extract features for three invasive patterns characteristic to the T1 stage bladder cancer (i.e., desmoplastic reaction, retraction artifact, and abundant pinker cytoplasm), using imaging processing software ImageJ and CellProfiler. Features extracted from the images were analyzed by a suite of machine learning approaches. Results We extracted nearly 700 features from the Ta and T1 tumor images. Unsupervised clustering analysis failed to distinguish hematoxylin and eosin images of Ta vs. T1 tumors. With a reduced set of features, we successfully distinguished 1177 Ta or T1 images with an accuracy of 91-96% by six supervised learning methods. By contrast, convolutional neural network (CNN) models that automatically extract features from images produced an accuracy of 84%, indicating that feature extraction driven by domain knowledge outperforms CNN-based automatic feature extraction. Further analysis revealed that desmoplastic reaction was more important than the other two patterns, and the number and size of nuclei of tumor cells were the most predictive features. Conclusions We provide a ML-empowered, feature-centered, and interpretable diagnostic system to facilitate the accurate staging of Ta and T1 diseases, which has a potential to apply to other types of cancer.","Machine learning,Deep learning,Bladder cancer,Histopathology images",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Medical Informatics,,3.394,"CLASSIFICATION,PROGNOSIS,IMAGE",BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7367328?pdf=render,
77,Spatial density neural network force fields with first-principles level accuracy and application to thermal transport,102,3,,"Rodriguez Alejandro,Liu Yinqiao,Hu Ming","Rodriguez A,Liu YQ,Hu M",Hu M,10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035203,University of South Carolina System,"Constrained by the fixed mathematical form of most empirical potentials used in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, many properties of materials cannot be captured within experimental accuracy. On the other hand, accurate electronic structure calculations based on quantum theory, most notably density functional theory (DFT), are limited to several hundred atoms within a picosecond, which makes the method inadequate for modeling systems beyond the nanoscale. A combination of speed from classical MD and fidelity from DFT can be achieved through machine learning methods. Herewith, we developed an approach named spatial density neural network force fields (SDNNFFs) by training neural networks to ""learn"" and predict DFT-level forces. Our model focuses on the usage of a three-dimensional mesh of density functions, which together act as a mapping of the atomic environment and provides a physical representation of the forces acting on the central atom. Several notable advantages arise from the SDNNFF, including (1) the avoidance of the chain rule on the total energy and other variables by direct calculation of the forces from the neural network, (2) the ever large N x t scaling of the training data, where N is the number of atoms in a supercell and t is the number of evaluated structures by first-principles, and (3) the significant reduction in parameters and human effort needed to successfully train a force- and/or property-converged neural network force field. Overall, we focus on modeling DFT-level forces with minimal computational cost and parametrization for rapid prediction of phonon-based properties and future molecular dynamics of large-scale systems. To demonstrate the SDNNFF, we trained several models on diamond structures, including bulk silicon (Si), diamond, silicon carbide (SiC), and boron arsenide (BAs), and predicted their phonon dispersions and lattice thermal conductivities using the direct solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. For phonon properties, we utilized a fitting method for obtaining the second-and third-order force constants, which outperforms the highly force-sensitive finite displacement method when employing neural network force fields. In comparison to DFT lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained high precision results from our SDNNFF within 0.7% for Si, 6.2% for diamond, 2.76% for SiC, and 7.46% for BAs, with further agreement with experiments. The phonon dispersions from the SDNNFF also matched those from direct DFT and experiments. The developed approach for accurately predicting phonon transport properties of crystalline materials would largely benefit the design of advanced materials with improved performance, such as complex thermoelectric devices and low thermal resistance interfaces for nanoelectronics. Future applications of our SDNNFF model could be extended toward including atomic energy into the algorithm and simulating large-scale heterogeneous systems for quasielectronic representations for various properties.","PHONON EIGENVECTORS,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,LATTICE-DYNAMICS,CONDUCTIVITY,DISPERSION,DISCOVERY",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"PHONON,EIGENVECTORS,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,LATTICE-DYNAMICS,CONDUCTIVITY,DISPERSION,DISCOVERY",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,,

Here, we consider different machine learning methods such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector classifier (SVC), AdaBoost classifier, bagging classifier, voting classifier, and Xception model to classify the breast cancer tumor and evaluate their performances. We used a standard dataset, i.e., breast Histopathology images, that has more than two lakhs color patches, each patch of size 50 x 50 scanned at the resolution of 40x. We use 60% of the above-mentioned dataset for training, 20% for validation, and 20% testing to all above-mentioned classifiers. The logistic regression classifier provides the scores of each precision, recall, and F1 measure as 0.72. The random forest method provides the score of each precision, recall, and F1 score as 0.80. The bagging and voting classifiers both have the values of each precision, recalls, and F1 scores as 0.81. In this case, both SVC and AdaBoost classifiers have the score of each precision, recall, and F1 score as 0.82, whereas in the case of the deep learning method, Xception model is used to have the score of each precision, recall, and F1 measure as 0.90 in the same condition.

However, labeled EEG samples are generally scarce and expensive to collect, while unlabeled samples are considered to be abundant in real applications. Although the semi-supervised learning (SSL) allows us to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the classification performance as against supervised algorithms, it has been reported that unlabeled data occasionally undermine the performance of SSL in some cases. To overcome this challenge, we propose a collaborative representation-based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (CR-SSELM) algorithm to evaluate the risk of unlabeled samples by a new safety-control mechanism. Specifically, the ELM model is firstly used to predict unlabeled samples and then the collaborative representation (CR) approach is employed to reconstruct the unlabeled samples according to the obtained prediction results, from which the risk degree of unlabeled sample is defined. A risk-based regularization term is then constructed accordingly and embedded into the objective function of the SS-ELM. Experiments conducted on benchmark and EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the ELM and SS-ELM algorithm.

Therefore, we developed a novel machine learning model to evaluate the impact of cardiac substructure dose for predicting radiation-induced pericardial effusion (PCE). Materials and methods One-hundred and forty-one stage III NSCLC patients, who received radiation therapy in a prospective clinical trial, were included in this analysis. The impact of dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics (mean and max dose, V5Gy[%]-V70Gy[%]) for the whole heart, left and right atrium, and left and right ventricle, on pericardial effusion toxicity (>= grade 2, CTCAE v4.0 grading) were examined. Elastic net logistic regression, using repeat cross-validation (n = 100 iterations, 75%/25% training/test set data split), was conducted with cardiac-based DVH metrics as covariates. The following model types were constructed and analyzed: (i) standard model type, which only included whole-heart DVH metrics; and (ii) a model type trained with both whole-heart and substructure DVH metrics. Model performance was analyzed on the test set using area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, calibration slope and calibration intercept. A final fitted model, based on the optimal model type, was developed from the entire study population for future comparisons. Results Grade 2 PCE incidence was 49.6% (n = 70). Models using whole heart and substructure dose had the highest performance (median values: AUC = 0.820; calibration slope/intercept = 1.356/-0.235; accuracy = 0.743) and outperformed the standard whole-heart only model type (median values: AUC = 0.799; calibration slope/intercept = 2.456/-0.729; accuracy = 0.713). The final fitted elastic net model showed high performance in predicting PCE (median values: AUC = 0.879; calibration slope/intercept = 1.352/-0.174; accuracy = 0.801). Conclusions We developed and evaluated elastic net regression toxicity models of radiation-induced PCE. We found the model type that included cardiac substructure dose had superior predictive performance. A final toxicity model that included cardiac substructure dose metrics was developed and reported for comparison with external datasets.","ESCALATION TRIALS,LEARNING-METHODS,RADIOTHERAPY,HEART,SELECTION,TOXICITY,STENOSIS,THERAPY,METRICS",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Oncology,,4.236,"ESCALATION,TRIALS,LEARNING-METHODS,RADIOTHERAPY,HEART,SELECTION,TOXICITY,STENOSIS,THERAPY,METRICS",ACTA ONCOLOGICA,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0284186X.2020.1794034?needAccess=true,

This treatment delivers highly conformal dose through the transperineal needle implants and is guided by a real time ultrasound (US) imaging system. Currently, the brachytherapy needles in the US images are manually segmented by physicists during the treatment, which is time consuming and error prone. In this study, we propose a set of deep learning-based algorithms to accurately segment the brachytherapy needles and locate the needle tips from the US images. Methods Two deep neural networks are developed to address this problem. First, a modified deep U-Net is used to segment the pixels belonging to the brachytherapy needles from the US images. Second, an additional VGG-16-based deep convolutional network is combined with the segmentation network to predict the locations of the needle tips. The networks are trained and evaluated on a clinical US images dataset with labeled needle trajectories collected in our hospital (Institutional Review Board approval (IRB 41755)). Results The evaluation results show that our method can accurately extract the trajectories of the needles with a resolution of 0.668 mm and 0.319 mm inxandydirection, respectively. 95.4% of thexdirection and 99.2% of theydirection have error <= 2 mm. Moreover, the position resolutions of the tips are 0.721, 0.369, and 1.877 mm inx,y, andzdirections, respectively, while 94.2%, 98.3%, and 67.5% of the data have error <= 2 mm. Conclusions This paper proposed a neural network-based algorithm to segment the brachytherapy needles from the US images and locate the needle tip.

Such simulations, however, are computationally demanding and cannot be reasonably applied to large systems containing more than a hundred atoms. Here, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to accelerate the calculation of high accuracy atomic forces and energies used during such MD simulations. After carefully training a robust ANN for four and five element systems, nearly identical lithium ion diffusivities are obtained for Li10GeP2S12(LGPS) when benchmarking the ANN-MD results with DFT-MD. Applying the ANN-MD approach, the effect of chlorine doping on the lithium diffusivity is calculated in an LGPS-like structure and it is found that a dopant concentration of 1.3% maximizes ionic conductivity. The optimal concentration balances the competing consequences of effective atomic radii and dielectric constants on lithium diffusion and agrees with the experimental composition. Performing simulations at the resolution necessary to model experimentally relevant and optimal concentrations would be infeasible with traditional DFT-MD. Systems that require a large number of simulated atoms can be studied more efficiently while maintaining high accuracy with the proposed ANN-MD framework.","artificial neural networks,ionic diffusion,machine learning,molecular dynamics,solid state electrolytes",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,4.004,"INITIO,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY,SIMULATIONS,POTENTIALS,CONDUCTORS,SURFACES,SYSTEMS",ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/adts.202000097,

The current clinical practice is to measure the diameter of the tumour in its largest dimension. It has been shown that volumetric measurement is more accurate and more reliable as a measure of VS size. The reference approach to achieve such volumetry is to manually segment the tumour, which is a time intensive task. We suggest that semi-automated segmentation may be a clinically applicable solution to this problem and that it could replace linear measurements as the clinical standard.
Methods Using high-quality software available for academic purposes, we ran a comparative study of manual versus semi-automated segmentation of VS on MRI with 5 clinicians and scientists. We gathered both quantitative and qualitative data to compare the two approaches; including segmentation time, segmentation effort and segmentation accuracy.
Results We found that the selected semi-automated segmentation approach is significantly faster (167 s vs 479 s, p<0.001), less temporally and physically demanding and has approximately equal performance when compared with manual segmentation, with some improvements in accuracy. There were some limitations, including algorithmic unpredictability and error, which produced more frustration and increased mental effort in comparison with manual segmentation.
Conclusion We suggest that semi-automated segmentation could be applied clinically for volumetric measurement of VS on MRI. In future, the generic software could be refined for use specifically for VS segmentation, thereby improving accuracy.","Segmentation,Vestibular schwannoma,Neuroimaging,Machine learning,Imaging",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"IMAGE,SEGMENTATION,NATURAL-HISTORY,TUMOR-GROWTH,FOLLOW-UP,QUANTIFICATION,RADIOSURGERY",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14462,

Due to the sluggish oxygen anion diffusion and the low doping of oxide, the computation of ion conductivity traditionally has to be performed with empirical force field potentials in order to achieve the required long timescale, which, however, fails to reproduce some critical observations in experiment, e.g., the conductivity maximum achieved at 8 mol % YSZ at the operating temperatures. Here by using our recently developed Y-Zr-O global neural network (G-NN) potential, we are able to carry out a series of long-time molecular dynamics simulations for YSZ at 6.7, 8, 10, and 14.3 mol % over a wide temperature range (800-2000 K). This finally quantitatively resolves the effects of temperature and composition on the ion conductivity. We confirm the key experimental findings that (i) 8 mol % YSZ has the highest ion conductivity, 0.16-0.51 S/cm, at 1200-1600 K, agreeing with 0.16-0.55 S/cm in experiment, and the maximum conductivity shifts to the higher Y composition above 1600 K and (ii) over the wide temperature range (800-2000 K) the ion conductivity of 8YSZ exhibits the non-Arrhenius behaviors with two different activation energies. The physical origin for these peculiar phenomena is revealed at the atomic level by analyzing the MD pathways. The presence of monoclinic phase and the aggregation of oxygen vacancy along < 112 > are two key factors to retard oxygen diffusion. For 8 mol % YSZ, the oxygen movement is dominated by local vibrations below 1000 K but becomes delocalized above 1000 K, which results in the gradual aggregation of oxygen vacancy along a new < 112 > direction. Our results demonstrate that the G-NN potential from unbiased machine learning of the global potential energy surface can meet the high standard in both accuracy and speed required for material simulation.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION,SURFACE WALKING METHOD,OXYGEN DIFFUSION,DEFECT STRUCTURE,SINGLE-CRYSTALS,MOL-PERCENT,COMPUTER-SIMULATION,TRACER DIFFUSION,CUBIC ZIRCONIA,TRANSPORT",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,SURFACE,WALKING,METHOD,OXYGEN,DIFFUSION,DEFECT,STRUCTURE,SINGLE-CRYSTALS,MOL-PERCENT,COMPUTER-SIMULATION,TRACER,DIFFUSION,CUBIC,ZIRCONIA,TRANSPORT",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

Machine learning is employed to train models based on adsorption isotherm features of more than 300 diverse structures to predict a benchmark measure of the surface area known as the true monolayer area.

The synergic effects between material properties and manufacturing solutions have been considered, extensively. Specifically, joining techniques have been developing with the aim to propose new suitable solutions considering dissimilarities in the properties of the materials that have to be combined. Setting of new manufacturing routes is, therefore, a demanding task. In this direction, there are several methods available in the scientific literature that are focused on sensitivity analysis or optimization/minimization techniques to reduce the necessary attempts or to find a solution/correlation among big data. In this work, the goal of obtaining high joint efficiency between Aluminum and Polycarbonate sheets by the Friction Spot Joining process is considered as a case study. This process must face two main issues, i.e., the mechanical, physical and chemical compatibilities between the parts and the integrity protection of the polymeric sheet near the joining area. The process parameters influences were analysed using numerical simulations performed by a commercial FE code. The number of executed analyses was reduced with a planned DoE. From these results, the Code2Vect algorithm was employed with the aim to visualize, efficiently, high-dimensional data and to evaluate the influences of some identified parameters on the process answer.

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and heart failure (HF) are two prevalent cardiac disorders that are associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality, especially if they are concurrently present. Current approaches fail to screen many at-risk individuals who would benefit from preventive treatment; while others receive unnecessary interventions. An effective approach to the detection of CVDs is mechanocardiography (MCG) by which translational and rotational precordial chest movements are monitored. In this study, we collected MCG data from a study sample of 300 hospitalized cardiac patients using multidimensional built-in inertial sensors of a smartphone. Our main objective was to detect concurrent AFib and acute decompensated HF (ADHF) using smartphone MCG (or sMCG). To this end, we adopted a supervised machine learning classification using multi-label and hierarchical classification. Logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting were used as candidate classifiers. The results of the analysis showed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.98 and 0.85 for AFib and ADHF, respectively. The highest percentages of positive and negative predictive values for AFib were 91.9 and 100; while for ADHF, they were 56.9 and 88.4 for the multi-label classification and 69.9 and 68.8 for the hierarchical classification, respectively.

One primary problem of EMAT is that it has relatively lower energy transition efficiency compared to widely used piezoelectric transducers, coupled with the effect of lift-off and the non-uniformity issue of welding material, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can be significantly restricted. This brings great difficulty in interpreting the EMAT signal measured from pipeline girth welds. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a deep learning-based ultrasonic pattern recognition method to identify the pipeline girth weld cracking automatically.

It intelligently learns cracking structures from input raw images by linear and nonlinear mapping process, flexible dynamically updates new weights and efficiently constructs the network by adding new incremental samples.
