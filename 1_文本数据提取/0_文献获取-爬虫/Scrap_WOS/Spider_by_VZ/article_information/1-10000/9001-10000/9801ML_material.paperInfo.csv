1,Accurate prediction of lumbar microdecompression level with an automated MRI grading system,50,1,69-78,"Roller Brandon L.,Boutin Robert D.,O'Gara Tadhg J.,Knio Ziyad O.,Jamaludin Amir,Tan Josh,Lenchik Leon","Roller BL,Boutin RD,O'Gara TJ,Knio ZO,Jamaludin A,Tan J,Lenchik L",Roller BL,10.1007/s00256-020-03505-w,Wake Forest University,"Objective Lumbar spine MRI interpretations have high variability reducing utility for surgical planning. This study evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework that generates automated MRI grading for its ability to predict the level that was surgically decompressed. Materials and methods Patients who had single-level decompression were retrospectively evaluated. Sagittal T2 images were processed by a CNN (SpineNet), which provided grading for the following: central canal stenosis, disc narrowing, disc degeneration, spondylolisthesis, upper/lower endplate morphologic changes, and upper/lower marrow changes. The grades were used to calculate an aggregate score. The variables and the aggregate score were analyzed for their ability to predict the surgical level. For each surgical level subgroup, the surgical level aggregate scores were compared with the non-surgical levels. Results A total of 141 patients met the inclusion criteria (82 women, 59 men; mean age 64 years; age range 28-89 years). SpineNet did not identify central canal stenosis in 32 patients. Of the remaining 109, 96 (88%) patients had a decompression at the level of greatest stenosis. The higher stenotic grade was present only at the surgical level in 82/96 (85%) patients. The level with the highest aggregate score matched the surgical level in 103/141 (73%) patients and was unique to the surgical level in 91/103 (88%) patients. Overall, the highest aggregate score identified the surgical level in 91/141 (65%) patients. The aggregate MRI score mean was significantly higher for the L3-S1 surgical levels. Conclusion A previously developed CNN framework accurately predicts the level of microdecompression for degenerative spinal stenosis in most patients.","Machine learning,Automated diagnosis,MRI,Low back pain,Lumbar degenerative disc disease,Spinal stenosis,Microdecompression",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Orthopedics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.046,"LOW-BACK-PAIN,MAGNETIC-RESONANCE,IMAGES,SPINAL,STENOSIS,PREOPERATIVE,MRI,ASSOCIATION,PREVALENCE,FEATURES,SURGERY,ADULTS",SKELETAL RADIOLOGY,,
2,Video-based motion-resilient reconstruction of three-dimensional position for functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography head mounted probes,7,3,,"Jaffe-Dax Sagi,Bermano Amit H.,Erel Yotam,Emberson Lauren L.","Jaffe-Dax S,Bermano AH,Erel Y,Emberson LL",Jaffe-Dax S,10.1117/1.NPh.7.3.035001,Princeton University,"Significance: We propose a video-based, motion-resilient, and fast method for estimating the position of optodes on the scalp.
Aim: Measuring the exact placement of probes (e.g., electrodes and optodes) on a participant's head is a notoriously difficult step in acquiring neuroimaging data from methods that rely on scalp recordings (e.g., electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and is particularly difficult for any clinical or developmental population. Existing methods of head measurements require the participant to remain still for a lengthy period of time, are laborious, and require extensive training. Therefore, a fast and motion-resilient method is required for estimating the scalp location of probes.
Approach: We propose an innovative video-based method for estimating the probes' positions relative to the participant's head, which is fast, motion-resilient, and automatic. Our method builds on capitalizing the advantages and understanding the limitations of cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning tools. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and provide proof of feasibility with infant subjects.
Results: We show that our method is both reliable and valid compared to existing state-of-the-art methods by estimating probe positions in a single measurement and by tracking their translation and consistency across sessions. Finally, we show that our automatic method is able to estimate the position of probes on an infant head without lengthy offline procedures, a task that has been considered challenging until now.
Conclusions: Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the use of automated spatial coregistration methods on developmental and clinical populations, where lengthy, motion-sensitive measurement methods routinely fail.

It is a significant task to re-sequence orders and group orders with identical color as a color batch to minimize the color changeover costs. In this paper, a Color-batching Resequencing Problem (CRP) with mix bank buffer systems is considered. We propose a Color-Histogram (CH) model to describe the CRP as a Markov decision process and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to solve the CRP integrated with the virtual car resequencing technique. The CH model significantly reduces the number of possible actions of the DQN agent, so that the DQN algorithm can be applied to the CRP at a practical scale. A DQN agent is trained in a deep reinforcement learning environment to minimize the costs of color changeovers for the CRP. Two experiments with different assumptions on the order attribute distributions and cost metrics were conducted and evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed conventional algorithms under both conditions. The proposed agent can run in real time on a regular personal computer with a GPU. Hence, the proposed approach can be readily applied in the production control of automotive paint shops to resolve order-resequencing problems.","Deep reinforcement learning,Color-Batching problem,Virtual car resequencing,Production control,Automotive industry",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Operations Research & Management Science",,7.333,"MODEL,ASSEMBLY,LINES,SELECTIVITY,BANKS,PAINT,ALGORITHM,LEVEL",JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS,,

However, the current method of diagnosing depression is questionnaire-based interviews, which is labor-intensive and highly dependent on doctors' experience. Thus, objective and cost-efficient methods are needed. In this paper, we present a case-based reasoning model for identifying depression. Electroencephalography data were collected using a portable three-electrode EEG device, and then processed to remove artifacts and extract features. We applied multiple classifiers. The best performing k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) was selected as the evaluation function to select the effective features which were then used to create the case base. Based on the weight set of standard deviations, the similarity was calculated using normalized Euclidean distance to get the optimal recognition rate of depression. The accuracy of optimal similarity identification of patients with depression was 91.25 percent, which was improved compared to the accuracy using KNN classifier (81.44 percent) or previously reported classifiers. Thus, we provide a novel pervasive and effective method for automatic detection of depression.","Electroencephalography,Brain modeling,Feature extraction,Cognition,Medical services,Physiology,Electrodes,Affective computing,affect sensing and analysis,health care,health implications",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Computer Science,,9.047,"INTEGRATION,PREDICTION,DISORDERS,ASYMMETRY",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING,,

The basic idea of the proposed EEG emotion recognition method is to use a graph to model the multichannel EEG features and then perform EEG emotion classification based on this model. Different from the traditional graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) methods, the proposed DGCNN method can dynamically learn the intrinsic relationship between different electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, represented by an adjacency matrix, via training a neural network so as to benefit for more discriminative EEG feature extraction. Then, the learned adjacency matrix is used to learn more discriminative features for improving the EEG emotion recognition. We conduct extensive experiments on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art methods, in which the average recognition accuracy of 90.4 percent is achieved for subject dependent experiment while 79.95 percent for subject independent cross-validation one on the SEED database, and the average accuracies of 86.23, 84.54 and 85.02 percent are respectively obtained for valence, arousal and dominance classifications on the DREAMER database.","Electroencephalography,Emotion recognition,Brain modeling,Feature extraction,Convolutional neural networks,Convolution,Biological neural networks,EEG emotion recognition,adjacency matrix,graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN),dynamical convolutional neural networks (DGCNN)",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Computer Science,,9.047,EXPRESSION,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING,,

While previous methods based on the facial analysis promise to advance clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder in a more efficient and objective manner, challenges in visual representation of complex depression pattern prevent widespread practice of automated depression diagnosis. In this paper, we present a deep regression network termed DepressNet to learn a depression representation with visual explanation. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural network equipped with a global average pooling layer is first trained with facial depression data, which allows for identifying salient regions of input image in terms of its severity score based on the generated depression activation map (DAM). We then propose a multi-region DepressNet, with which multiple local deep regression models for different face regions are jointly leaned and their responses are fused to improve the overall recognition performance. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method significantly boosts state-of-the-art performance of the visual-based depression recognition. Most importantly, the DAM induced by our learned deep model may help reveal the visual depression pattern on faces and understand the insights of automated depression diagnosis.","Visualization,Feature extraction,Videos,Face recognition,Face,Computer architecture,Image recognition,Depression recognition,face recognition,deep convolutional neural network,depression activation map",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Computer Science,,9.047,DISEASE,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING,,

The last few decades have witnessed an intensive research on binary classification of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. Multiclass classification of pathological brain MR images is a more challenging task and the literature on this problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a new automated diagnosis system to classify the brain MR images into five different categories. Texture features within MR images play a significant role in accurate and efficient pathological brain detection. This work presents the extraction of such vital texture features by calculating the entropy over the curvelet subbands. Two faster and simpler strategies of fast curvelet transform are separately employed for feature extraction and the derived features are termed as FCEntF-I and FCEntF-II. The features are finally subjected to kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM) for classification. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated on multiclass as well as binary brain MR datasets. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme. The discriminatory potential of FCEntF-I and FCEntF-II features is found better than its counterparts.","Fast curvelet transform,entropy,kernel ELM,texture features,magnetic resonance imaging",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,,"EXTREME,LEARNING-MACHINE,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,TEXTURE,CLASSIFICATION,NEURAL-NETWORKS,IMAGES,MRI,SYSTEM,ADABOOST",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING,,

Typically, such investigations have taken a `black box' approach in which the internal structure of themodel used is set purely by machine learning considerations with little consideration of representing the internalstructure of the biological system by the mathematical structure of the DNN. DNNs have not yet been applied to thedetailed modeling of transcriptional control in which mRNA production is controlled by the binding of specific transcriptionfactors to DNA, in part because such models are in part formulated in terms of specific chemical equationsthat appear different in form from those used in neural networks.
Results: In this paper, we give an example of a DNN whichcan model the detailed control of transcription in a precise and predictive manner. Its internal structure is fully interpretableand is faithful to underlying chemistry of transcription factor binding to DNA. We derive our DNN from asystems biology model that was not previously recognized as having a DNN structure. Although we apply our DNNto data from the early embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila, this system serves as a test bed for analysis of much larger datasets obtained by systems biology studies on a genomic scale.","COOPERATIVE DNA-BINDING,DROSOPHILA,EXPRESSION,ENHANCERS,STRIPE,SEGMENTATION,REPRESSION,MECHANISM,NETWORKS,SEQUENCE",Article; Proceedings Paper,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematics",,,"COOPERATIVE,DNA-BINDING,DROSOPHILA,EXPRESSION,ENHANCERS,STRIPE,SEGMENTATION,REPRESSION,MECHANISM,NETWORKS,SEQUENCE",BIOINFORMATICS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/05/31/655639.full.pdf,
10,Prediction of sperm extraction in non-obstructive azoospermia patients: a machine-learning perspective,35,7,1505-1514,"Zeadna A.,Khateeb N.,Rokach L.,Lior Y.,Har-Vardi I,Harlev A.,Huleihel M.,Lunenfeld E.,Levitas E.","Zeadna A,Khateeb N,Rokach L,Lior Y,Har-Vardi I,Harlev A,Huleihel M,Lunenfeld E,Levitas E",Huleihel M,10.1093/humrep/deaa109,Ben Gurion University,"STUDY QUESTION: Can a machine-learning-based model trained in clinical and biological variables support the prediction of the presence or absence of sperm in testicular biopsy in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Our machine-learning model was able to accurately predict (AUC of 0.8) the presence or absence of spermatozoa in patients with NOA.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Patients with NOA can conceive with their own biological gametes using ICSI in combination with successful testicular sperm extraction (TESE). Testicular sperm retrieval is successful in up to 50% of men with NOA. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing model that can accurately predict the success of sperm retrieval in TESE. Moreover, machine-learning has never been used for this purpose.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study of 119 patients who underwent TESE in a single IVF unit between 1995 and 2017 was conducted. All patients with NOA who underwent TESE during their fertility treatments were included. The development of gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) aimed to predict the presence or absence of spermatozoa in patients with NOA. The accuracy of these GBTs was then compared to a similar multivariate logistic regression model (MvLRM).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We employed univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models to predict the probability of successful TESE using a dataset from a retrospective cohort. In addition, we examined various ensemble machine-learning models (GBT and random forest) and evaluated their predictive performance using the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. A cutoff value for successful/unsuccessful TESE was calculated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: ROC analysis resulted in an AUC of 0.807 +/- 0.032 (95% CI 0.743-0.871) for the proposed GBTs and 0.75 +/- 0.052 (95% CI 0.65-0.85) for the MvLRM for the prediction of presence or absence of spermatozoa in patients with NOA. The GBT approach and the MvLRM yielded a sensitivity of 91% vs. 97%, respectively, but the GBT approach has a specificity of 51% compared with 25% for the MvLRM. A total of 78 (65.3%) men with NOA experienced successful TESE. FSH, LH, testosterone, semen volume, age, BMI, ethnicity and testicular size on clinical evaluation were included in these models.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is a retrospective cohort study, with all the associated inherent biases of such studies. This model was used only for TESE, since micro-TESE is not performed at our center.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Machine-learning models may lay the foundation for a decision support system for clinicians together with their NOA patients concerning TESE. The findings of this study should be confirmed with further larger and prospective studies.","non-obstructive azoospermia,NOA,TESE,machine-learning,prediction,male infertility",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Obstetrics & Gynecology,Reproductive Biology",,7.366,"FOLLICLE-STIMULATING-HORMONE,SERUM,INHIBIN-B,Y-CHROMOSOME,MICRODELETIONS,MALE-INFERTILITY,CANNOT,PREDICT,RETRIEVAL,RATE,MEN,SPERMATOZOA,SUCCESS,FSH",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,,

Classical superpixel-based classification algorithms suffer from edge leakage due to complexity and heterogeneity inherent in medical images. Therefore, we propose a deep U-Net with superpixel region merging processing incorporated for edge enhancement to facilitate and optimize segmentation. Our approach combines three innovations: (1) different from deep learning-based image segmentation, the segmentation evolved from superpixel region merging via U-Net training getting rich semantic information, in addition to gray similarity; (2) a bilateral filtering module was adopted at the beginning of the network to eliminate external noise and enhance soft tissue contrast at edges of pathogy; and (3) a normalization layer was inserted after the convolutional layer at each feature scale, to prevent overfitting and increase the sensitivity to model parameters. This model was validated on lung CT, brain MR, and coronary CT datasets, respectively. Different superpixel methods and cross validation show the effectiveness of this architecture. The hyperparameter settings were empirically explored to achieve a good trade-off between the performance and efficiency, where a four-layer network achieves the best result in precision, recall, F-measure, and running speed. It was demonstrated that our method outperformed state-of-the-art networks, including FCN-16s, SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLabv3, and traditional U-Net, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Our experiments show that our proposed approach improves the classification performance by up to 7% using CNNs and more than 10% while using texture descriptors.

To achieve an acceptable segmentation performance, most of the existing methods need to annotate amounts of filamentary images in the training stage. Hence, these methods have to face the common challenge that the annotation cost is usually high. To address this problem, we propose an interactive segmentation method to actively select a few super-pixels for annotation, which can alleviate the burden of annotators. Specifically, we first apply a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (i.e., SLIC) algorithm to segment filamentary images into compact and consistent super-pixels, and then propose a novel batch-mode based active learning method to select the most representative and informative (i.e., BMRI) super-pixels for pixel-level annotation. We then use a bagging strategy to extract several sets of pixels from the annotated super-pixels, and further use them to build different Laplacian Regularized Gaussian Mixture Models (Lap-GMM) for pixel-level segmentation. Finally, we perform the classifier ensemble by combining multiple Lap-GMM models based on a majority voting strategy. We evaluate our method on three public available filamentary image datasets. Experimental results show that, to achieve comparable performance with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm can save 40 percent annotation efforts for experts.","Filamentary image,super-pixels,simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC),active learning,ensemble",Article,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Computer Science,Mathematics",,3.395,"VESSEL,SEGMENTATION,NEURON,MODELS",IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS,,

For high-value technical parts, the geometric and appearance quality need to be guaranteed. The control of the part, directly on the manufacturing line, can be achieved with noncontact sensors. Visible spectrum imaging is commonly used. However, more information could be obtained from broader spectrum imaging and from the degree of linear polarization of the light from the part. We investigate polarimetry. We have developed a simple polarimetric imaging system to verify whether linear polarization is capable of amplifying geometric and appearance defects. We evaluate the use of this polarimetric imager given the industrial constraints of injection molding.

However, traditional machine learning and deep learning methods focus on the single electrode feature analysis and ignore the functional connection of the brain. In addition, the recent brain function connection network method needs to manually extract substantial brain network features, which results in cumbersome operation. For this reason, this paper introduces graph convolution combined with brain function connection theory into the study of mental fatigue and proposes a method for driving fatigue detection based on the partial directed coherence graph convolutional neural network (PDC-GCNN), which can analyze the characteristics of single electrodes while automatically extracting the topological features of the brain network. We designed a fatigue driving simulation experiment and collected the EEG signals. In the present work, the PDC method constructs the adjacency matrix to describe the relationship between EEG channels, and the GCNN combines single-electrode local brain area information and brain area connection information to further improve the performance of detecting fatigue states. Based on the features of differential entropy (DE) and power spectral density (PSD), the average recognition accuracy of ten-fold cross validation is 84.32% and 83.84%, respectively. For further experiments on each subject, the average recognition results are 95.24%/5.10% (PSD) and 96.01%/3.81% (DE).

The output of the ML analysis can inform evaluators and validators on the quality, or lack thereof, of specific nuclear data and benchmark experiments with respect to simulating these experimental benchmark values. To this end, measured and simulated effective neutron multiplication factors, k(eff), of 875 selected ICSBEP critical assemblies and the latter's sensitivities with respect to nuclear data as well as benchmarks' features (e.g., material nuclide, core geometry) are used as input for a random forest (RF) regression model. The RF is used to encode the complex inter-dependencies between thousands of nuclear data features (i.e., sensitivity profiles and aspects describing the measurements) and 875 simulated and experimental k(eff) values in order to understand what nuclear data features are most informative for predicting bias. The complexity of relationships and high-dimensional space is difficult-to-impossible to search fully using simply expert judgment. As a first proof-of-concept-step, it is demonstrated that this technique is able to correctly trace large discrepancies between simulated and experimental k(eff) back to fabricated shortcomings in nuclear data that were perturbed to simulated k eff values. In a second, real-case scenario, step, the RF algorithm is used to validate the ENDF/B-VIII.0 library in comparison to ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data. One case is showcased where the chosen ML algorithms highlighted nuclear data (the F-19(n,inl) cross section from 0.4-0.9 MeV) that are shown to be problematic by comparing them to associated differential experimental data and nuclear data from other libraries. In addition to that, it is shown that the RF results point towards poor benchmark experiments and associated underestimated uncertainties (e.g., the PU-SOL-THERM-028 series). However, using the RF algorithm for validating nuclear data with respect to k(eff) is currently limited to pinpointing groups of questionable nuclear data due to the inherent correlations between features introduced by the nuclear data themselves and how k(eff) is simulated. Due to this, we recommend that the ML methods presented be used to augment -rather than replace-the expert knowledge of evaluators and validators.",SCIENCE,Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE, 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",Physics,,,SCIENCE,NUCLEAR DATA SHEETS,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1711382,

In this study, sleep sound signals are used to detect OSA in patients.Approach: A deep feature transfer-based OSA detection approach is proposed. First, a deep convolutional neural network is trained on large-scale labeled audio data sets to distinguish respiration sounds from environmental noise. Second, the trained model is transferred to recognize respiration sounds in sleep sound signals. Third, the deep features of the detected respiration sounds are used to train a logistic regression classifier to identify OSA patients from potential patients.

The detection of sleep-wake states is thus of paramount importance in the study of sleep. The gold standard method for sleep-wake classification is multi-sensor-based polysomnography (PSG) which is normally recorded in a clinical setting. The main drawbacks of PSG are the inconvenience to the subjects, the impact of discomfort on normal sleep cycles, and its requirement for experts' interpretation. In contrast, we aim to design an automated approach for sleep-wake classification using a wearable fingertip photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal.Approach: Time domain features are extracted from PPG and PPG-based surrogate cardiac signals for sleep-wake classification. A minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance feature selection algorithm is employed to reduce irrelevant and redundant features.Main results: A support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised machine-learning classifier is then used to classify sleep and wake states. The model is trained using 70% of the events (6575 sleep-wake events) from the dataset, and the remaining 30% of events (2818 sleep-wake events) are used for evaluating the performance of the model.

One of the major tasks associated with the BCI system is to improve classification performance of the motor imagery (MI) signal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for the MI BCI system. The raw EEG signals are usually non-stationary time series with weak class properties, degrading the classification performance.Approach: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to pattern extraction which provides meaningful data presentation. However, NMF is unsupervised and cannot make use of the label information. Based on the label information of MI EEG data, we propose a novel method, called double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (DCNMF), to improve the classification performance of NMF on MI BCI. The proposed method constructs a couple of label matrices as the constraints on the NMF procedure to make the EEGs with the same class labels have the similar representation in the low-dimensional space, while the EEGs with different class labels have dissimilar representations as much as possible. Accordingly, the extracted features obtain obvious class properties, which are optimal to the classification of MI EEG.Main results: This study is conducted on the BCI competition III datasets (I and IVa). The proposed method helps to achieve a higher average accuracy across two datasets (79.00% for dataset I, 77.78% for dataset IVa); its performance is about 10% better than the existing studies in the literature.Significance: Our study provides a novel solution for MI BCI analysis from the perspective of label constraint; it provides convenience for semi-supervised learning of features and significantly improves the classification performance.","brain-computer interface,motor imagery,electroencephalogram,double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization",Article,"IOP Publishing Ltd, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,2.866,"SPATIAL-PATTERNS,EEG,BCI",PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,,

This article investigates a smart process monitoring approach that employs acoustic emission (AE)-elastic waves sourced from various plastic deformation and fracture mechanisms-to characterize the variations in the NFRP machining process. The state-of-the-art analytic tools are incapable of handling the transient dynamic patterns with long-term correlations and bursts in AE and how process conditions and the underlying material removal mechanisms affect these patterns. To address this gap, we investigated two types of the bidirectional gated recurrent deep learning neural network (BD-GRNN) models, viz., bidirectional long short-term memory and bidirectional gated recurrent unit to predict the process conditions based on dynamic AE patterns. The models are tested on the AE signals gathered from orthogonal cutting experiments on NFRP samples performed at six different cutting speeds and three fiber orientations.

Because of limited information from current production practice, it is very challenging to control product quality, meet the tight tolerance, and eliminate scrap parts, which is especially critical for expensive aeroengine components. With the recent development of Industrial Internet of Things and Operation Technologies, it is now feasible to digitize the production process and take machine reliability and performance to a new level. In this study, the machining process is simulated in the virtual environment, and the output response is used as a reference digital thread of the process. In real-time machining, the computer numerical control (CNC) control signals together with existing machinery sensors and historical data are monitored and fused together to observe the machining conditions. Comparing the reference signature with supervised machine learning analytics, any subtle deviations in operating behavior, which are often the early warning signs of problems, can be identified. Also, with the look-ahead function, it gives the operators better visibility into the machining process. With the proposed method, without adding any more hardware to existing production machineries, it is feasible to capture data in real time, conduct automated analysis of the information, and create visualizations for team members.

Hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis can convert wet organic wastes into hydrochar and pyrochar, which are potential fossil fuel alternatives due to their comparable fuel properties. Machine learning (ML) has strong prediction ability after being trained with historic dataset and facilitates good understanding of the impact of input features on output targets through a data-driven approach. In this study, ML models for multi-task prediction of fuel properties of the chars were developed and optimized based on two datasets for hydrochar and pyrochar. Feature importance and correlation were explored based on optimized ML model, and feature re-examination was conducted for model improvement. Results showed that support vector regression model with optimal hyper-parameters exhibited better generalized performance for prediction of both hydrochar and pyrochar properties with the best average R-2 of 0.90 and 0.94. ML-based feature analysis indicated that process temperature and carbon content in the feedstock were the significant features impacting fuel properties of both chars, while nitrogen content was another important input feature for hydrochar and hydrogen content for pyrochar. The accuracy (especially for pyrochar), generalization ability, and computational speed of models were further improved after feature re-examination. The intuitions obtained from feature analysis provided meaningful insights to select input features for prediction performance improvement and computational cost saving, and might guide experiments to produce chars with desired quality.","Biochar,Waste to energy,Pyrolysis,Hydrothermal carbonization,Machine learning,Multi-task prediction",Article; Proceedings Paper,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,9.953,"HYDROTHERMAL,CARBONIZATION,SEWAGE-SLUDGE,RANDOM,FORESTS,SOLID-WASTE,PYROLYSIS,BIOMASS,BIOCHAR,PRETREATMENT,REGRESSION,TEMPERATURE",APPLIED ENERGY,,

Summary: Cancer registries are collections of curated data about malignant tumor diseases. The amount of data processed by cancer registries increases every year, making manual registration more and more tedious. Objective: We sought to develop an automatic analysis pipeline that would be able to identify and preprocess registry input for incident prostate adenocarcinomas in a French regional cancer registry.
Methods: Notifications from different sources submitted to the Bas-Rhin cancer registry were used here: pathology data and, ICD 10 diagnosis codes from hospital discharge data and healthcare insurance data. We trained a Support Vector Machine model (machine learning) to predict whether patient's data must be considered or not as a prostate adenocarcinoma incident case that should therefore be registered. The final registration of all identified cases was manually confirmed by a specialized technician. Text mining tools (regular expressions) were used to extract clinical and biological data from non-structured pathology reports.
Results: We performed two successive analyses. First, we used 982 cases manually labeled by registrars from the 2014 dataset to predict the registration of 785 cases submitted in 2015. Then, we repeated the procedure using the 2089 cases labeled by registrars from the 2014 and 2015 datasets to predict the registration of 926 cases submitted in the 2016 data. The algorithm identified 663 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma in 2015, and 610 in 2016. From these findings, 663 and 531 cases were respectively added to the registry; and 641 and 512 cases were confirmed by the specialized technician. This registration process has achieved a precision level above 96 %. The algorithm obtained an overall precision of 99 % (99.5 % in 2015 and 98.5 % in 2016) and a recall of 97 % (97.8 % in 2015 and 96.9 % in 2016). When the information was found in pathology report, text mining was more than 90 % accuracy for major indicators: PSA test, Gleason score, and incidence date). For both PSA and tumor side, information was not detected in the majority of cases.""
Conclusion: Machine learning was able to identify new cases of prostate cancer, and text mining was able to prefill the data about incident cases. Machine-learning-based automation of the registration process could reduce delays in data production and allow investigators to devote more time to complex tasks and analysis.","Cancer registry,Machine learning,Prostate adenocarcinoma",Article,"ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD, ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,4.768,"PATHOLOGY,REPORTS,CLASSIFICATION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,,

Among youth attending the most violent schools, studies have reported higher dropout rates, poor school attendance, and poor scholastic achievement. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given an individualized prevention program. However, much work is needed to establish an effective approach to identify at-risk subjects.
Objective: In our earlier research, we developed a risk assessment program to interview subjects, identify risk and protective factors, and evaluate risk for school violence. This study focused on developing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to automate the risk assessment process.
Material and methods: We prospectively recruited 131 students with or without behavioral concerns from 89 schools between 05/01/2015 and 04/30/2018. The subjects were interviewed with two risk assessment scales and a questionnaire, and their risk of violence were determined by pediatric psychiatrists based on clinical judgment. Using NLP technologies, different types of linguistic features were extracted from the interview content. Machine learning classifiers were then applied to predict risk of school violence for individual subjects. A two-stage feature selection was implemented to identify violence-related predictors. The performance was validated on the psychiatrist-generated reference standard of risk levels, where positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity (SEN), negative predictive value (NPV), specificity (SPEC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were assessed.
Results: Compared to subjects' sociodemographic information, use of linguistic features significantly improved classifiers' predictive performance (P < 0.01). The best-performing classifier with n-gram features achieved 86.5 %/86.5 %/85.7 %/85.7 %/94.0 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the cross-validation set and 83.3 %/93.8 %/91.7 %/78.6 %/94.6 % (PPV/SEN/NPV/SPEC/AUC) on the test data. The feature selection process identified a set of predictors covering the discussion of subjects' thoughts, perspectives, behaviors, individual characteristics, peers and family dynamics, and protective factors.
Conclusions: By analyzing the content from subject interviews, the NLP and machine learning algorithms showed good capacity for detecting risk of school violence. The feature selection uncovered multiple warning markers that could deliver useful clinical insights to assist personalizing intervention. Consequently, the developed approach offered the promise of an accurate and scalable computerized screening service for preventing school violence.","Automated risk assessment,School violence,Machine learning,Natural language processing",Article,"ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD, ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,4.768,"ADOLESCENTS,BRACHA,CHILDREN,RELIABILITY,AGGRESSION,BEHAVIOR",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104137,

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data. HMAA is believed to have allowed individuals to visualize and conceptualize abstract ideas that would have been otherwise challenging using static models. The outcomes of this article indicate the significant potential of body-ownership-based self-learning tools for anatomy.

Benefiting from the adaptive decomposition without the mode mixing, variational mode decomposition (VMD), has emerged as a promising technology for processing and analyzing acoustic signals. However, improper parameter settings are the root cause of inaccurate VMD results, while existing optimization methods for VMD parameters are only applicable to a single signal with exclusive signal characteristics, rather than different signals with similar features. Therefore, we developed a new acoustic signal analysis method combining VMD, beetle antennae search (BAS), and naive Bayes classification (NBC), and then applied it for detecting internal defects of arc magnets. In this method, multiple optimizations for different signals are simplified to a one-time optimization for the whole signal group by a specially designed parameter-related fitness function. Since the coordinates of the function maximum value in a parameter space correspond to the unified parameter setting generating the overall optimal processing effect for all signals, BAS is introduced to achieve a rapid search of coordinates. With the obtained unified parameter setting, each acoustic signal of arc magnets can be consistently processed by VMD. Next, two modes stemmed from VMD are screened out by an energy threshold, and their specific frequency information is extracted as features representing the internal defects. NBC is carried out to learn and identify the extracted features. The experimental validation of the proposed method was conducted by detecting various arc magnets. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy reaches 100% and the detection speed per a single arc magnet approximately ranges between 1.7 and 4.5 s. This work provides not only a new strategy for the parameter optimization of VMD, but also a practical solution for the internal defect detection of arc magnets. (C) 2020 ISA.

Urban green spaces produce NAIs and perform valuable ecological functions; this phenomenon has attracted much attention. However, NAIs in urban green spaces are influenced by many factors, leading to extremely large variability in their concentrations and complicating their measurement. Therefore, we collected observational data on NAI concentrations (NAICs), as well as on other environmental factors for one year in Shanghai City Park. We then used this data to construct an indicator of NAI variability (NAIV); we understand NAIV to be dependent upon NAIC, and study of the derivative can better reflect the driving force and dominant factors of the original function. Based on a preliminary investigation of correlation, and on a multiple linear regression analysis, we used a random forest algorithm to evaluate the influence of various factors that affect the variability of NAIs. The results show that ""water factors,"" whose main contribution is humidity, exert the most influence, followed by ""phenology factors,"" whose main contribution is temperature, and ""particulate factors,"" whose main contribution is PM2.5. High humidity, high temperature, and low PM(2.5)concentration enrich NAI generation and extend their lifetimes, thus helping to maintain them within a relatively stable range. In this study, the main driving forces that govern NAI changes were shown to be humidity, temperature and particulate matter. Our results may help to deepen our understanding of NAI characteristics and applications in urban green spaces.","green space,negative air ions (NAIs),variability,environmental factors,random forest (RF),importance evaluation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",,2.848,CLASSIFICATION,ATMOSPHERE,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/11/7/706/pdf,

Current research mostly focuses on questions like ""which hand is intended to move"". While answering questions like ""whether a hand is intended to move"" is more desirable for widely realworld applications, because we cannot continuously perform intention tasks during usage, and the gap periods may cause unintended operation resulting in system failures. However, this kind of intention detection task is more difficult, since for a ""whether"" problem, it is hard to know what the ""not"" situation is and consequently to acquire training samples for the ""not"" situation. Furthermore, the occurrence of genuine intentions is comparatively scarce and unexpected, making the intention detection task hard and computation-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a Reconstruction-based Intention Detection (RID) framework, which utilises a reconstruction model to represent a high-level abstraction of EEG signals and leverages the reconstruction errors to determine ""whether"" there is a movement intention. Our framework is not only theoretically flexible and robust to any sophisticated real-world scenarios but also hand-crafted feature and domain knowledge free. Comprehensive experiments on detecting movement intention tasks with different reconstruction models demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed reconstruction intention detection framework.","intention detection,deep learning,EEG",Article,"CHINA INST COMMUNICATIONS, NO 13 WEST CHANG AN AVENUE, BEIJING, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",Telecommunications,,1.981,,CHINA COMMUNICATIONS,,

In the present study, a thermodynamic knowledge-based MLFFNN has been developed to predict the martensite start temperature (M-S) of steels that accounts for the variations in critical driving force (Delta G(c)) and austenitization temperature (T-gamma). This is achieved by integrating two crudely estimated properties (Delta G(c) and T-gamma) in the feature space. Instead of using the original dataset directly, the feature space was reshaped by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The genetic algorithm was implemented to find a suitable hyperparameters set that was able to induce a model with high predictive capability. The resulting neural network performs well in the present dataset, and the RMSE in the unseen datasets is 21.52 K. Benchmarking of the MLFFNN predictions against JmatPro-V8 calculations also shows a significant improvement in predictive accuracy. Results indicate KPCA and the integration of crude estimation property (CEP) boost the predictive accuracy of MLFFNN. Besides, the present study also demonstrates the CEP strategy is general enough to be employed in several well-known machine learning methods including support vector regression, decision tree and Gaussian process regression.

Within this paradigm, the patterns of muscular activity used for control can differ from those which control biological limbs. Practice expedites the learning of these new, functional patterns of muscular activity. We envisage that these methods can result in enhanced control without increasing device complexity. However, key questions about training protocols, generalisation and scalability of motor learning-based methods have remained. In this work, we pursue three objectives: 1) to validate the motor learning-based abstract myoelectric control approach with people with upper-limb difference for the first time; 2) to test whether, after training, participants can generalize their learning to tasks of increased difficulty; and 3) to show that abstract myoelectric control scales with additional input signals, offering a larger control range. In three experiments, 25 limb-intact participants and 8 people with a limb difference (congenital and acquired) experienced a motor learning-based myoelectric controlled interface. We show that participants with upper-limb difference can learn to control the interface and that performance increases with experience.

Previous research has shown that using different visual scenarios during mental practices that involve imagining the movement of a specific body part may result in differences in performance. Many of these scenarios utilize the concept of embodiment, or one's observation of another entity to be a part of oneself, to improve practice quality of the imagined body movement. We therefore hypothesized that applying immersive virtual reality headsets, with their ability to provide rich immersion and illusion by presenting egocentrically simulated virtual scenarios, and action observation to motor imagery practice will result in significant improvement. To explore the possible synergy between immersive systems and motor imagery, we analyzed the electroencephalogram signals of our participants as they were presented the same virtual hand movement scenario with two different mediums: an immersive virtual reality headset and a monitor display. Our experimental results provide evidence that the immersive virtual reality headsets induced improved rhythmic patterns with better discriminating spatial features from the brain compared to the monitor display. These findings suggest that the use of immersive virtual reality headsets, with the illusion and embodiment they provide, can effectively improve motor imagery training.","Task analysis,Headphones,Grasping,Monitoring,Electroencephalography,Brain,Electrodes,Virtual reality (VR),mental practice,motor imagery,action observation,embodiment,neural activity,electroencephalography (EEG),event-related desynchronization (ERD),machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Rehabilitation",,4.735,"FUNCTIONAL,RECOVERY,VISUAL,FEEDBACK,EEG,STROKE,RHYTHM,%28DE%29SYNCHRONIZATION,DESYNCHRONIZATION,EMBODIMENT,MU",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,,

Furthermore, the performance of the classifier was improved by evaluating the best hyperparameter in deep learning architecture. To validate the performance of deep learning, the public dataset from ten subjects was evaluated.

The CNN can discriminate the ten hand-motion based on raw EMG signal without handcrafts feature extraction. The results of the evaluation showed that CNN outperformed other classifiers. The average accuracy for all motion ranges between 0.77 and 0.93. The statistical t-test between using two-channel(CH1 and CH2) and single-channel(CH2) shows that there is no significant difference in accuracy with p-value >0.05.

The study adopts a 12M sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate alkaline solution of ratio to fly ash at 0.33 for geopolymer reaction. In addition to the conventional material (river sand), fly ash was partially replaced with silica fume and granulated blast furnace slag. Various properties of the concrete, filler ability and passing ability of fresh mixtures, and compressive, split-tensile and flexural strength of hardened concrete were determined. The model development involved using raw materials and fresh mix properties as predictors, and strength properties as response. Results shows that the use of the admixtures enhanced both the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete. Both GEP and ANN methods exhibited good prediction of the experimental data, with minimal errors.

This article will discuss how machine learning classification can be used to characterize the initial impairment and subsequent recovery of electromyography signals in an non-human primate model of traumatic spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to identify potential treatments for traumatic spinal cord injury. This work focuses specifically on finding a suitable classifier that differentiates between two distinct experimental stages (pre-and post-lesion) using electromyography signals. Eight time-domain features were extracted from the collected electromyography data. To overcome the imbalanced dataset issue, synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied. Different ML classification techniques were applied including multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, and radial basis function network; then their performances were compared. A confusion matrix and five other statistical metrics (sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and F-measure) were used to evaluate the performance of the generated classifiers. The results showed that the best classifier for the left- and right-side data is the multilayer perceptron with a total F-measure of 79.5% and 86.0% for the left and right sides, respectively.

In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10% of the number of scan points for a full grid.","Compressive sensing,super-resolution,wavefield imaging,non-destructive testing,structural health monitoring",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,5.861,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,RECONSTRUCTION,SUPERRESOLUTION,RECOVERY,PLATES",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

Distributed optical fiber sensor based on Brillouin optical time-domain analysis technology exhibits great facility to measure strain distributions along the whole surface of structures with a high spatial resolution, thus providing a potential and competitive solution to the detection problem. However, mainly due to low signal-to-noise ratio in measurements, such sensor system is still limited in crack detection-based structural health monitoring applications. How to extract high-quality micro-crack feature representations from the low signal-to-noise ratio-distributed strain measurements is crucial to solve the problem. It has been demonstrated in field of pattern recognition that deep learning can automatically extract high-quality noise-robust feature representations from mass chaos data. Therefore, a micro-crack detection method is proposed herein based on deep learning to analyze the full-scale strain measurements. Each measurement is normalized and segmented into a set of equal-length subsequences. Autoencoders, a typical kind of building block of deep neural network, are stacked layer-wise into a deep network and then exploited to automatically extract feature representations from the subsequences. Each extracted feature representation is labeled as one of the two categories by a Softmax regression. One category originates in the subsequences acquired from structure sections with crack defects and another from sections without any cracks. The micro-crack detections are achieved by solving such a crack/non-crack binary classification problem. A 15-m-long steel I-beam with artifact crack defects is built up in laboratory to verify the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the minimum size of detectable crack opening width reaches to 23 mu m, and besides, the proposed method is significantly better than traditional Fisher linear discriminant analysis method and classical support vector machine on the detection accuracy.","Structural health monitoring,crack detection,pattern recognition,deep learning,feature representation,stacked autoencoder,Brillouin optical time-domain analyzer",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,5.861,"DAMAGE,DETECTION,NEURAL-NETWORKS,DIAGNOSIS,DIMENSIONALITY,REDUCTION",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

The purpose of this work is to check whether these differences exist and how they are related to children's performance in different language and cognitive tasks commonly used to detect dyslexia. To this purpose, temporal and spectral inter-channel EEG connectivity was estimated, and a denoising autoencoder (DAE) was trained to learn a low-dimensional representation of the connectivity matrices. This representation was studied via correlation and classification analysis, which revealed ability in detecting dyslexic subjects with an accuracy higher than 0.8, and balanced accuracy around 0.7. Some features of the DAE representation were significantly correlated (p < 0.005) with children's performance in language and cognitive tasks of the phonological hypothesis category such as phonological awareness and rapid symbolic naming, as well as reading efficiency and reading comprehension. Finally, a deeper analysis of the adjacency matrix revealed a reduced bilateral connection between electrodes of the temporal lobe (roughly the primary auditory cortex) in DD subjects, as well as an increased connectivity of the F7 electrode, placed roughly on Broca's area.

Deep learning approaches based on 3D fully convolutional networks (FCNs), have improved state-of-the-art segmentation performance in CMR images. However, previous methods have employed several pre-processing steps and have focused primarily on segmenting low-resolutions images. A crucial step in any automatic segmentation approach is to first localize the cardiac structure of interest within the MRI volume, to reduce false positives and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two strategies for localizing and segmenting the heart ventricles and myocardium, termed multi-stage and end-to-end, using a 3D convolutional neural network. Our method consists of an encoder-decoder network that is first trained to predict a coarse localized density map of the target structure at a low resolution. Subsequently, a second similar network employs this coarse density map to crop the image at a higher resolution, and consequently, segment the target structure. For the latter, the same two-stage architecture is trained end-to-end. The 3D U-Net with some architectural changes (referred to as 3D DR-UNet) was used as the base architecture in this framework for both the multi-stage and end-to-end strategies. Moreover, we investigate whether the incorporation of coarse features improves the segmentation. We evaluate the two proposed segmentation strategies on two cardiac MRI datasets, namely, the Automatic Cardiac Segmentation Challenge (ACDC) STACOM 2017, and Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge (LASC) STACOM 2018. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods indicate that the proposed multi-stage framework consistently outperforms the rest in terms of several segmentation metrics. The experimental results highlight the robustness of the proposed approach, and its ability to generate accurate high-resolution segmentations, despite the presence of varying degrees of pathology-induced changes to cardiac morphology and image appearance, low contrast, and noise in the CMR volumes.","cardiac MRI,deep neural network,CNN,multistage segmentation,MRI segmentation,cardiovascular diseases",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,"RIGHT,VENTRICLE,MODEL",JOURNAL OF IMAGING,https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/15565/jimaging-06-00065-v2.pdf,

Methodology: For this purpose, data from the Court of Auditors of the State of Paraiba and the Apriori machine learning algorithm were used to build association rules in a sample of 104 thousand biddings, with 60 thousand bidders. The association rules were evaluated considering patterns of cooperative strategies in repeated games, taking account the bid winner likelihood and the bidders competition on average. How companies mapped in the association rules were ranked by the firm's suspicion indicator (ISE), directly related to the probability of victory, association with false tests and spatially concentrated performance. ISE is a contribution proposed by this research. Findings: The results revealed indications of suspected collusion for various companies such as meals suppliers, cleaning services, rental of vehicles, copiers, stages, chemical toilets, fuel suppliers, automotive parts, sports equipments, medicines and hospital material, consulting in accounting, civil engineering and advertising, considering each of the three municipal management periods (2005-2008, 2009-2012 and 2013-2016). We also found several patterns of association between bidders with evidence of competition simulation and concentrated activity in a few municipalities. Contribution: the results, particularly by the firm's suspicion indicator, provide important initial guidelines to optimize inspection and auditing processes in justice control bodies, whose undisputed identification of a potential bidding fraud, necessarily, requires complementary and specific procedural evaluations for each case.","Procurement Auctions,Collusion,Machine learning,Rules association,Paraiba",Article,"UNIV FEDERAL PARAIBA, CIDADE UNIV, JOAO PESSOA, PB 58059-900, BRAZIL",Business & Economics,,,"PROCUREMENT,COMPETITION",TEORIA E PRATICA EM ADMINISTRACAO-TPA,https://periodicos.ufpb.br/index.php/tpa/article/download/51526/30936/141049,

More effort is needed to assess the role of these viruses in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer cases in women. The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient segmentation and classification system in the Mammography Image Analysis Society (MIAS) images of medical images. Segmentation became challenging for medical images because they are not illuminated in the correct way. The role of segmentation is essential in concern with detecting syndromes in human. This research work is on the segmentation of medical images based on intuitionistic possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (IPFCM) clustering. Intuitionist fuzzy c-mean (IFCM) and possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (PFCM) algorithms are hybridised to deal with problems of fuzzy c-mean. The introduced clustering methodology, in this article, retains the positive points of PFCM which helps to overcome the problem of the coincident clusters, thus the noise and less sensitivity to the outlier. The IPFCM improves the fundamentals of fuzzy c-mean by using intuitionist fuzzy sets. For the clustering of mammogram images for breast cancer detector of abnormal images, IPFCM technique has been applied. The proposed method has been compared with other available fuzzy clustering methods to prove the efficacy of the proposed approach. We compared support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), rough set data analysis (RSDA) and Fuzzy-SVM classification algorithms for achieving an optimal classification result. The outcomes of the studies show that the proposed approach is highly effective with clustering and also with classification of breast cancer.

Accurate predictions for blood glucose are the base for control algorithms in glucose regulating systems such as the artificial pancreas. Numerous research studies have already been conducted in order to provide predictions for blood glucose levels with particularities in the input signals and underlying models used. These models can be categorized into two major families: those based on tuning glucose physiological-metabolic models and those based on learning glucose evolution patterns based on machine learning techniques. This paper reviews the state of the art in blood glucose predictions for T1DM patients and proposes, implements, validates and compares a new hybrid model that decomposes a deep machine learning model in order to mimic the metabolic behavior of physiological blood glucose methods. The differential equations for carbohydrate and insulin absorption in physiological models are modeled using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.

In practice, the task of labeling these retinal images is very costly, financially and in human effort. To deal with these problems, we propose a semi-supervised learning method which can be used in blood vessel segmentation with limited labeled data. In this method, we use the improved U-Net deep learning network to segment the blood vessel tree. On this basis, we implement the U-Net network-based training dataset updating strategy.

It was trained on data from a large longitudinal study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and has been shown to accurately identify cervices with early stages of cervical neoplasia for clinical evaluation and treatment. The algorithm processes images of the uterine cervix taken with a digital camera and alerts the user if the woman is a candidate for further evaluation. This requires that the algorithm be presented with images of the cervix, which is the object of interest, of acceptable quality, i.e., in sharp focus, with good illumination, without shadows or other occlusions, and showing the entire squamo-columnar transformation zone. Our prior work has addressed some of these constraints to help discard images that do not meet these criteria. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that determines that the image contains the cervix to a sufficient extent. Non-cervix or other inadequate images could lead to suboptimal or wrong results. Manual removal of such images is labor intensive and time-consuming, particularly in working with large retrospective collections acquired with inadequate quality control. In this work, we present a novel ensemble deep learning method to identify cervix images and non-cervix images in a smartphone-acquired cervical image dataset.

Here, we examined the possibility of whether AI could diagnose DN from immunofluorescent images. We collected renal immunofluorescent images from 885 renal biopsy patients in our hospital, and we created a dataset that contains six types of immunofluorescent images of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q and Fibrinogen for each patient. Using the dataset, 39 programs worked without errors (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.93). Five programs diagnosed DN completely with immunofluorescent images (AUC: 1.00). By analyzing with Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (Lime), the AI focused on the peripheral lesion of DN glomeruli. On the other hand, the nephrologist diagnostic ratio (AUC: 0.75833) was slightly inferior to AI diagnosis. These findings suggest that DN could be diagnosed only by immunofluorescent images by deep learning.

The machine learning methods can be used-by extracting new insights from available biological data sets, and provide further guidance for experimental studies. This study identifies the most relevant highly surface-specific features that might be responsible for cytotoxic behavior of 2D materials, especially MXenes. In particular, two factors, namely, the presence of transition metal oxides and lithium atoms on the surface, are identified as cytotoxicity-generating features. The developed machine learning model succeeds in predicting toxicity for other 2D MXenes, previously not tested in vitro, and hence, is able to complement the existing knowledge coming from in vitro studies.

In order to improve the subgrade performance, the structural yield strength (SYS) of remolded soil and its factor sensitivity are investigated in this study. Saline soils in Western Jilin are structural in the sense that the bonding strength of soil skeleton is mainly provided by the solidification bond formed by a physicochemical interaction between particles. Its SYS is influenced by its cementation type, genetic characteristics, original rock structure, and environment. Because of the high clay content in Zhenlai saline soil, the specific surface area of soil particles is large, and the surface adsorption capacity of soil particles is strong. In addition, the main cation is Na+. The cementation strength of bound water film between soil particles is thus easily affected by water content and salt content, and compaction is also an important factor affecting the strength of soil. Therefore, in this study, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model and a support vector machine (SVM) are used to explore the relationship of saline soil's SYS with its compactness, water content, and salt content. In total, 120 data points collected by a high-pressure consolidation experiment are applied to building BPNN and SVM model. For eliminate redundant features, Pearson correlation coefficient (r(PCC)) is used as an evaluation standard of feature selection. The K-fold cross-validation method was used to avoid over fitting. To compare the performance of the BPNN and SVM models, three statistical parameters were used: the determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD). The result shows that the average values of R-2, RMSE, and MAPD of the BPNN model are superior to the values of the SVM. We conclude that the BPNN model is slightly better than the SVM for predicting the SYS of saline soil. Thus, the BPNN model is used to analyze the factor sensitivity of SYS. The results indicate that the influence degrees of the three parameters are as follows: water content > compactness > salt content. This study can provide a basis for estimating the structural yield pressure of soil from its basic properties, and can provide a new way to obtain parameters for geotechnical engineering, ensuring safety while maintaining symmetry in engineering costs.","structural yield strength (SYS),back-propagation neural network (BPNN),support vector machine (SVM),parameter sensitivity analysis",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,2.612,"HIGH-PERFORMANCE,CONCRETE,BEHAVIOR,STEEL,AREA",SYMMETRY-BASEL,https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/symmetry/symmetry-12-01163/article_deploy/symmetry-12-01163-v2.pdf,

These systems are trained to spot objectionable content and to remove it, block it, or filter it out before it is even uploaded. Artificial intelligence filters offer a robust approach to content moderation which is shaping the public sphere. This dramatic shift in norm setting and law enforcement is potentially game-changing for democracy. Artificial intelligence filters carry censorial power, which could bypass traditional checks and balances secured by law. Their opaque and dynamic nature creates barriers to oversight, and conceals critical value choices and tradeoffs. Currently, we lack adequate tools to hold them accountable. This paper seeks to address this gap by introducing an adversarial procedure- - Contesting Algorithms. It proposes to deliberately introduce friction into the dominant removal systems governed by artificial intelligence. Algorithmic content moderation often seeks to optimize a single goal, such as removing copyright-infringing materials or blocking hate speech, while other values in the public interest, such as fair use or free speech, are often neglected. Contesting algorithms introduce an adversarial design which reflects conflicting values, and thereby may offer a check on dominant removal systems. Facilitating an adversarial intervention may promote democratic principles by keeping society in the loop. An adversarial public artificial intelligence system could enhance dynamic transparency, facilitate an alternative public articulation of social values using machine learning systems, and restore societal power to deliberate and determine social tradeoffs.","Content moderation,rule of law,accountability,democracy,artificial intelligence,copyright",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",Social Sciences - Other Topics,,8.118,"FAIR-USE,1ST-AMENDMENT,CENSORSHIP,SPEECH",BIG DATA & SOCIETY,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951720932296,

Ablations were then resected as a whole, and histologic slices were obtained orthogonally through the ablation center. Subsequently, a vital stain was applied to the sections for visualization of coagulation necrosis. Computed tomography images were reformatted to match the histologic slices. Afterwards, quantitative imaging features were extracted from the subregions of all images, and binary classifiers were used to predict the presence of coagulation necrosis for each subregion. From this, heatmaps could be created, which visually represented the extent of necrosis in each CT image. Two independent observers evaluated the extent of coagulative necrosis between the heat maps and histological sections. Results We applied 4 different classifiers, including a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), a stochastic gradient boosting classifier, a random forest classifier, and a k-nearest neighbor classifier, out of which the GLMM showed the best performance to display coagulation necrosis. The GLMM resulted in an area under the curve of 0.84 and a Jaccard index of 0.6 between the generated heat map and the histologic reference standard as well as a good interobserver agreement with a Jaccard index of 0.9. Conclusions Subregion radiomics analysis may improve visualization of coagulation necrosis after hepatic MWA in an in vivo porcine model.","hepatic microwave ablation,contrast-enhanced computed tomography,radiomics,porcine model,machine learning",Article,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS, TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,5.958,"RADIOFREQUENCY,ABLATION,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,RADIATION,NECROSIS,CT,MRI,CLASSIFICATION,MALIGNANCIES,ULTRASOUND,CARCINOMA,PERFUSION",INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY,,

For this purpose, we use computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on multiparametric assessment. Materials and Methods Consecutive data were used from the first screening round of the DENSE (Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening) trial. In this trial, asymptomatic women with a negative screening mammography and extremely dense breasts were screened using multiparametric MRI. In total, 4783 women, aged 50 to 75 years, enrolled and were screened in 8 participating hospitals between December 2011 and January 2016. In total, 525 lesions in 454 women were given a BI-RADS 3 (n = 202), 4 (n = 304), or 5 score (n = 19). Of these lesions, 444 were benign and 81 were malignant on histologic examination. The MRI protocol consisted of 5 different MRI sequences: T1-weighted imaging without fat suppression, diffusion-weighted imaging, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images at high spatial resolution, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images at high temporal resolution, and T2-weighted imaging. A machine-learning method was developed to predict, without deterioration of sensitivity, which of the BI-RADS 3- and BI-RADS 4-scored lesions are actually benign and could be prevented from being recalled. BI-RADS 5 lesions were only used for training, because the gain in preventing false-positive diagnoses is expected to be low in this group. The CAD consists of 2 stages: feature extraction and lesion classification. Two groups of features were extracted: the first based on all multiparametric sequences, the second based only on sequences that are typically used in abbreviated MRI protocols. In the first group, 49 features were used as candidate predictors: 46 were automatically calculated from the MRI scans, supplemented with 3 clinical features (age, body mass index, and BI-RADS score). In the second group, 36 image features and the same 3 clinical features were used. Each group was considered separately in a machine-learning model to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. We developed a Ridge regression model using 10-fold cross validation. Performance of the models was analyzed using an accuracy measure curve and receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Results Of the total number of BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4 lesions referred to additional MRI or biopsy, 425/487 (87.3%) were false-positive. The full multiparametric model classified 176 (41.5%) and the abbreviated-protocol model classified 111 (26.2%) of the 425 false-positive BI-RADS 3- and BI-RADS 4-scored lesions as benign without missing a malignant lesion. If the full multiparametric CAD had been used to aid in referral, recall for biopsy or repeat MRI could have been reduced from 425/487 (87.3%) to 311/487 (63.9%) lesions. For the abbreviated protocol, it could have been 376/487 (77.2%). Conclusions Dedicated multiparametric CAD of breast MRI for BI-RADS 3 and 4 lesions in screening of women with extremely dense breasts has the potential to reduce false-positive diagnoses and consequently to reduce the number of biopsies without missing cancers.","magnetic resonance imaging,machine learning,breast density,screening,false-positives",Article,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS, TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,5.958,"CONTRAST-ENHANCED,MRI,CANCER,LESIONS,IMAGES,RISK",INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY,https://journals.lww.com/investigativeradiology/Fulltext/2020/07000/Computer_Aided_Diagnosis_in_Multiparametric.5.aspx,

The purpose of this study was to quantify, for the first time, the percentage of avoidable radiation during fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular interventions using eye tracking technologies. Materials and Methods Mobile eye tracking glasses were used to measure precisely when the operators looked at a fluoroscopy screen during the interventions. A novel machine learning algorithm and image processing techniques were used to automatically analyze the data and compute the percentage of avoidable radiation. Based on this percentage, the amount of potentially avoidable radiation dose was computed. Results This study included 30 cardiovascular interventions performed by 5 different operators. A significant percentage of the administered radiation (mean [SD], 43.5% [12.6%]) was avoidable (t(29)= 18.86,P< 0.00001); that is, the operators were not looking at the fluoroscopy screen while the x-ray was on. On average, this corresponded to avoidable amounts of air kerma (mean [SD], 229 [66] mGy) and dose area product (mean [SD], 32,781 [9420] mGycm(2)), or more than 11 minutes of avoidable x-ray usage, per procedure. Conclusions A significant amount of the administered radiation during cardiovascular interventions is in fact avoidable.","X-ray dose reduction,fluoroscopy,eye tracking,radiation dosing,catheter-based interventions,education,safety",Article,"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS, TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,5.958,,INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY,,

Measurements of the material state of the cytosol are challenging due to its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Recent development of genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) has opened up study of the cytosol at the length scales of multiprotein complexes (20-60 nm). We developed an image analysis pipeline for 3D imaging of GEMs in the context of large, multinucleate fungi where there is evidence of functional compartmentalization of the cytosol for both the nuclear division cycle and branching. We applied a neural network to track particles in 3D and then created quantitative visualizations of spatially varying diffusivity. Using this pipeline to analyze spatial diffusivity patterns, we found that there is substantial variability in the properties of the cytosol. We detected zones where GEMs display especially low diffusivity at hyphal tips and near some nuclei, showing that the physical state of the cytosol varies spatially within a single cell. Additionally, we observed significant cell-to-cell variability in the average diffusivity of GEMs. Thus, the physical properties of the cytosol vary substantially in time and space and can be a source of heterogeneity within individual cells and across populations.","PHASE-SEPARATION,PROTEIN,LOCALIZATION",Article,"AMER SOC CELL BIOLOGY, 8120 WOODMONT AVE, STE 750, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2755 USA",Cell Biology,,4.614,"PHASE-SEPARATION,PROTEIN,LOCALIZATION",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7359570,

Materials and methods: Eighty-six patients who underwent prostate SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) were included. Patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes were derived from bowel and bladder symptom scores on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) at 3 and 12 months post-SBRT. We utilized ensemble machine learning (ML) to interrogate the entire dose-volume histogram (DVH) to evaluate relationships between dose-volume parameters and HRQOL changes. The latent predictive dosimetric parameters that were most associated with HRQOL changes in urinary and rectal function were thus identified. An external cohort of 26 prostate SBRT patients was acquired to further test the predictive models.
Results: Bladder dose-volume metrics strongly predicted patient-reported urinary irritative and incontinence symptoms (area under the curves [AUCs] of 0.79 and 0.87, respectively) at 12 months. Maximum bladder dose, bladder V102.5%, bladder volume, and conformity indices (V50/VPTV and V100/VPTV) were most predictive of HRQOL changes in both urinary domains. No strong rectal toxicity dosimetric association was identified (AUC = 0.64).
Conclusion: We demonstrated the application of advanced ML methods to identify a set of dosimetric variables that most highly correlated with patient-reported urinary HRQOL. DVH quantities identified with these methods may be used to achieve outcome-driven planning objectives to further reduce patient-reported toxicity with prostate SBRT. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although three-dimensional (3D) scanning is the gold standard for diagnosing such deformities, it requires expensive laser scanners and skilled maneuvering. We therefore developed an inexpensive, fast, and convenient screening method to classify cranial deformities in infants, based on single two-dimensional vertex cranial images. In total, 174 measurements from 80 subjects were recorded. Our screening software performs image processing and machine learning-based estimation related to the deformity indices of the cranial ratio (CR) and cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) to determine the severity levels of brachycephaly and plagiocephaly. For performance evaluations, the estimated CR and CVAI values were compared to the reference data obtained using a 3D cranial scanner. The CR and CVAI correlation coefficients obtained via support vector regression were 0.85 and 0.89, respectively. When the trained model was evaluated using the unseen test data for the three CR and three CVAI classes, an 86.7% classification accuracy of the proposed method was obtained for both brachycephaly and plagiocephaly. The results showed that our method for screening cranial deformities in infants could aid clinical evaluations and parental monitoring of the progression of deformities at home.","plagiocephaly,brachycephaly,positional cranial deformities,cephalic ratio,cranial vault asymmetry index,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",General & Internal Medicine,,,"CLASSIFICATION,DEFORMATION,DIAGNOSIS",DIAGNOSTICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400331,

The distinctive facial features of Down syndrome provide an opportunity for automatic identification. Recent studies showed that facial recognition technologies have the capability to identify genetic disorders. However, there is a paucity of studies on the automatic identification of Down syndrome with facial recognition technologies, especially using deep convolutional neural networks. Here, we developed a Down syndrome identification method utilizing facial images and deep convolutional neural networks, which quantified the binary classification problem of distinguishing subjects with Down syndrome from healthy subjects based on unconstrained two-dimensional images. The network was trained in two main steps: First, we formed a general facial recognition network using a large-scale face identity database (10,562 subjects) and then trained (70%) and tested (30%) a dataset of 148 Down syndrome and 257 healthy images curated through public databases. In the final testing, the deep convolutional neural network achieved 95.87% accuracy, 93.18% recall, and 97.40% specificity in Down syndrome identification. Our findings indicate that the deep convolutional neural network has the potential to support the fast, accurate, and fully automatic identification of Down syndrome and could add considerable value to the future of precision medicine.","deep convolutional neural network,facial recognition,down syndrome,deep learning,facial image",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",General & Internal Medicine,,3.674,"DIAGNOSIS,CHILDREN,FACE,AGE",DIAGNOSTICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400586,

This research investigates the feasibility of applying machine learning to predict events of stuck pipes during drilling operations in petroleum fields. The predictive model aims to predict the occurrence of stuck pipes so that relevant drilling operation personnel are warned to enact a mitigation plan to prevent stuck pipes. Two machine learning methodologies were studied in this research, namely, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). A total of 268 data sets were successfully collected through data extraction for the well drilling operation. The data also consist of the parameters with which the stuck pipes occurred during the drilling operations. These drilling parameters include information such as the properties of the drilling fluid, bottom-hole assembly (BHA) specification, state of the bore-hole and operating conditions. The R programming software was used to construct both the ANN and SVM machine learning models. The prediction performance of the machine learning models was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on these two machine learning models. For the ANN, two activation functions-namely, the logistic activation function and hyperbolic tangent activation function-were tested. Additionally, all the possible combinations of network structures, from [19, 1, 1, 1, 1] to [19, 10, 10, 10, 1], were tested for each activation function. For the SVM, three kernel functions-namely, linear, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and polynomial-were tested. Apart from that, SVM hyper-parameters such as the regularization factor (C), sigma (sigma) and degree (D) were used in sensitivity analysis as well. The results from the sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the best ANN model managed to achieve an 88.89% accuracy, 91.89% sensitivity and 86.36% specificity, whereas the best SVM model managed to achieve an 83.95% accuracy, 86.49% sensitivity and 81.82% specificity. Upon comparison, the ANN model is the better machine learning model in this study because its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are consistently higher than those of the best SVM model. In conclusion, judging from the promising prediction accurateness as demonstrated in the results of this study, it is suggested that stuck pipe prediction using machine learning is indeed practical.","artificial neural networks,drilling operation,RBF Kernel function,stuck pipe,support vector machines,sensitivity analysis",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Energy & Fuels,,3.085,"FILL,REMOVAL,FOAM",ENERGIES,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/14/3683/pdf,

Each of these different flavors of MD have been independently used by materials scientists to bring about breakthroughs in materials discovery and design. A significant gulf exists between the various MD flavors, each having varying levels of fidelity. The accuracy of DFT orab initioMD is generally much higher than that of classical atomistic simulations which is higher than that of coarse-grained models. Multi-fidelity scale bridging to combine the accuracy and flexibility ofab initioMD with efficiency classical MD has been a longstanding goal. The advent of big-data analytics has brought to the forefront powerful machine learning methods that can be deployed to achieve this goal.

The performance results for each model were statistically analyzed, evaluated, and compared in terms of predictive performance, processing time, and outlier sensibility to facilitate the choice of a predictive method to obtain the thickness and length of an internal defect from thermographic monitoring. The best model to predictdefect thickness with six thermal features was interaction linear regression. To make predictive models for defect length and thickness, the best model was Gaussian process regression. However, models such as support vector machines also had significative advantages in terms of processing time and adequate performance for certain feature sets.

OCT examinations can aid in the detection of many retina disorders in early stages that could not be detected in traditional retina images. In this paper, a new hybrid computer-aided OCT diagnostic system (HyCAD) is proposed for classification of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and drusen disorders, while separating them from Normal OCT images. The proposed HyCAD hybrid learning system integrates the segmentation of Region of Interest (RoI), based on central serious chorioretinopathy (CSC) in Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images, with deep learning architectures for effective diagnosis of retinal disorders. The proposed system assimilates a range of techniques including RoI localization and feature extraction, followed by classification and diagnosis. An efficient feature fusion phase has been introduced for combining the OCT image features, extracted by Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with the features extracted from the RoI segmentation phase. This fused feature set is used to predict multiclass OCT retina disorders. The proposed segmentation phase of retinal RoI regions adds substantial contribution as it draws attention to the most significant areas that are candidate for diagnosis. A new modified deep learning architecture (Norm-VGG16) is introduced integrating a kernel regularizer. Norm-VGG16 is trained from scratch on a large benchmark dataset and used in RoI localization and segmentation. Various experiments have been carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed system. Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) v3 benchmark is used to validate the efficiency of the model compared with others in literature. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves relatively high-performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. An average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.8%, 99.4% and 98.2% is achieved, respectively. The remarkable performance achieved reflects that the fusion phase can effectively improve the identification ratio of the urgent patients' diagnostic images and clinical data. In addition, an outstanding performance is achieved compared to others in literature.","deep learning,CNN,feature generation,feature fusion,RoI segmentation,OCT,retina disorders",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"AUTOMATED,LAYER,SEGMENTATION,GRADIENT",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/14/4716/pdf,

Transferring tcVNS technologies to at-home settings brings challenges associated with the assessment of therapy response. The ability to accurately detect whether tcVNS has been effectively delivered in a remote setting such as the home has never been investigated. We designed and conducted a study in which 12 human subjects received active tcVNS and 14 received sham stimulation in tandem with traumatic stress, and measured continuous cardiopulmonary signals including the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), seismocardiogram (SCG), and respiratory effort (RSP). We extracted physiological parameters related to autonomic nervous system activity, and created a feature set from these parameters to: 1) detect active (vs. sham) tcVNS stimulation presence with machine learning methods, and 2) determine which sensing modalities and features provide the most salient markers of tcVNS-based changes in physiological signals. Heart rate (ECG), vasomotor activity (PPG), and pulse arrival time (ECG+PPG) provided sufficient information to determine target engagement (compared to sham) in addition to other combinations of sensors. resulting in 96% accuracy, precision, and recall with a receiver operator characteristics area of 0.96. Two commonly utilized sensing modalities (ECG and PPG) that are suitable for home use can provide useful information on therapy response for tcVNS.
