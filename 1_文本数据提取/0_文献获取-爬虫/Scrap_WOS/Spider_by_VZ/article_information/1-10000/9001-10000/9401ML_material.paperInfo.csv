1,Automated Quantitative Analyses of Fatigue-Induced Surface Damage by Deep Learning,13,15,,"Thomas Akhil,Durmaz Ali Riza,Straub Thomas,Eberl Chris","Thomas A,Durmaz AR,Straub T,Eberl C",Thomas A; Durmaz AR,10.3390/ma13153298,Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"The digitization of materials is the prerequisite for accelerating product development. However, technologically, this is only beneficial when reliability is maintained. This requires comprehension of the microstructure-driven fatigue damage mechanisms across scales. A substantial fraction of the lifetime for high performance materials is attributed to surface damage accumulation at the microstructural scale (e.g., extrusions and micro crack formation). Although, its modeling is impeded by a lack of comprehensive understanding of the related mechanisms. This makes statistical validation at the same scale by micromechanical experimentation a fundamental requirement. Hence, a large quantity of processed experimental data, which can only be acquired by automated experiments and data analyses, is crucial. Surface damage evolution is often accessed by imaging and subsequent image post-processing. In this work, we evaluated deep learning (DL) methodologies for semantic segmentation and different image processing approaches for quantitative slip trace characterization. Due to limited annotated data, a U-Net architecture was utilized. Three data sets of damage locations observed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of ferritic steel, martensitic steel, and copper specimens were prepared. In order to allow the developed models to cope with material-specific damage morphology and imaging-induced variance, a customized augmentation pipeline for the input images was developed. Material domain generalizability of ferritic steel and conjunct material trained models were tested successfully. Multiple image processing routines to detect slip trace orientation (STO) from the DL segmented extrusion areas were implemented and assessed. In conclusion, generalization to multiple materials has been achieved for the DL methodology, suggesting that extending it well beyond fatigue damage is feasible.","deep learning,semantic segmentation,extrusions,micro cracks,slip trace analysis,generalization",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"LOCALIZATION,SLIP",MATERIALS,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/13/15/3298/pdf,

This study proposes a random forest algorithm-based modeling method that successfully maps both the steel's chemical composition and environmental factors to the corrosion rate of low-alloy steel under the corresponding environmental conditions. Using the random forest models based on the corrosion data of three different atmospheric environments, the environmental factors were proved to have different importance sequence in determining the environmental corrosivity of open and sheltered exposure test conditions. For each exposure test site, the importance of environmental features to the corrosion rate is also ranked and analyzed. Additionally, the feasibility of the random forest model to predict the corrosion rate of steel samples in the new environment is also demonstrated. The volume and representativeness of the corrosion data in the training data are considered to be the critical factors in determining its prediction performance. The above results prove that machine learning provides a useful tool for the analysis of atmospheric corrosion mechanisms and the evaluation of corrosion resistance.","atmospheric corrosion,low-alloy steel,atmospheric exposure test,feature importance,random forest,machine learning,data mining",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"WEATHERING,STEELS,CR",MATERIALS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7435615,

For achieving this goal, an experimental database containing 422 instances was firstly gathered from the literature and used to develop the FNN-OSS algorithm. The input variables in the database contained the geometrical characteristics of CFST columns, and the mechanical properties of two CFST constituent materials, i.e., steel and concrete. Thereafter, the selection of the appropriate parameters of FNN-OSS was performed and evaluated by common statistical measurements, for instance, the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). In the next step, the prediction capability of the best FNN-OSS structure was evaluated in both global and local analyses, showing an excellent agreement between actual and predicted values of the load-bearing capacity. Finally, an in-depth investigation of the performance and limitations of FNN-OSS was conducted from a structural engineering point of view.

4,A New Approach for Understanding Urban Microclimate by Integrating Complementary Predictors at Different Scales in Regression and Machine Learning Models,12,15,,"Alonso Lucille,Renard Florent","Alonso L,Renard F",Alonso L,10.3390/rs12152434,Universite Jean Moulin Lyon 3,"Climate change is a major contemporary phenomenon with multiple consequences. In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.","air temperature,surface temperature,LiDAR,multiple linear regression,Landsat 8,urban heat island",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Geology,Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,5.353,"HEAT-ISLAND,INTENSITY,AIR-TEMPERATURE,SPATIAL,ASSOCIATION,DAILY,MAXIMUM,CLIMATE,INTERPOLATION,CITY,EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,DERIVATION,VEGETATION",REMOTE SENSING,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/15/2434/pdf,

This problem could have negative effects on their bio-psycho-social well-being if they are not provided with comprehensive psychological treatment. Numerous methods have been developed to help them relax, but there are no current approaches for assessing the relaxation level they reach. Based on this, a novel smart sensor that can evaluate the level of relaxation a child experiences is developed in this paper. It evaluates changes in thermal biomarkers (forehead, right and left cheek, chin, and maxillary) and heart rate (HR). Then, through a k-nearest neighbors (K-NN) intelligent classifier, four possible levels of relaxation can be obtained: no-relax, low-relax, relax, and very-relax. Additionally, an application (called i-CARE) for anxiety management, which is based on biofeedback diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery, and video games, is evaluated. After testing the developed smart sensor, an 89.7% accuracy is obtained. The smart sensor used provides a reliable measurement of relaxation levels and the i-CARE application is effective for anxiety management, both of which are focused on children exposed to out-of-home care conditions.","children in out-of-home care,thermal biomarkers,biofeedback,relaxation,smart sensor",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"PRINCIPAL,COMPONENT,THERMOGRAPHY,HEART-RATE,RESPIRATORY,RATE,EMOTION,ANALYSIS,CLASSIFICATION,HEALTH,INTERVENTIONS,RECOGNITION,SIGNAL",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7435878,
6,Estimating Vertical Ground Reaction Force during Walking Using a Single Inertial Sensor,20,15,,"Jiang Xianta,Napier Christopher,Hannigan Brett,Eng Janice J.,Menon Carlo","Jiang XT,Napier C,Hannigan B,Eng JJ,Menon C",Menon C,10.3390/s20154345,Simon Fraser University,"The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and its passive and active peaks are important gait parameters and of great relevance for musculoskeletal injury analysis and prevention, the detection of gait abnormities, and the evaluation of lower-extremity prostheses. Most currently available methods to estimate the vGRF require a force plate. However, in real-world scenarios, gait monitoring would not be limited to a laboratory setting. This paper reports a novel solution using machine learning algorithms to estimate the vGRF and the timing and magnitude of its peaks from data collected by a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) on one of the lower limb locations. Nine volunteers participated in this study, walking on a force plate-instrumented treadmill at various speeds. Four IMUs were worn on the foot, shank, distal thigh, and proximal thigh, respectively. A random forest model was employed to estimate the vGRF from data collected by each of the IMUs. We evaluated the performance of the models against the gold standard measurement of the vGRF generated by the treadmill. The developed model achieved a high accuracy with a correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and normalized root mean square error of 1.00, 0.02 body weight (BW), and 1.7% in intra-participant testing, and 0.97, 0.10 BW, and 7.15% in inter-participant testing, respectively, for the shank location. The difference between the reference and estimated passive force peak values was 0.02 BW and 0.14 BW with a delay of -0.14% and 0.57% of stance duration for the intra- and inter-participant testing, respectively; the difference between the reference and estimated active force peak values was 0.02 BW and 0.08 BW with a delay of 0.45% and 1.66% of stance duration for the intra- and inter-participant evaluation, respectively. We concluded that vertical ground reaction force can be estimated using only a single IMU via machine learning algorithms. This research sheds light on the development of a portable wearable gait monitoring system reporting the real-time vGRF in real-life scenarios.","IMU,ground reaction force,gait analysis,walking",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"PRESSURE,INSOLES,PATTERNS,SPEED",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/15/4345/pdf,

In this work, we propose a novel framework, named TumorGAN, to generate image segmentation pairs based on unpaired adversarial training. To improve the quality of the generated images, we introduce a regional perceptual loss to enhance the performance of the discriminator. We also develop a regionalL1loss to constrain the color of the imaged brain tissue. Finally, we verify the performance of TumorGAN on a public brain tumor data set, BraTS 2017.

The primary advantage of the hidden Markov model is that the ability to learn with less information, in other words, its future states do not depend on past ones, based only on the present state. We use long short-term memory to train data, and output consequences improved by adding predicted different changes that are computed by hidden Markov model. Applying this combined method to numerical examples of forecasting crack propagation of singled-edge-notched beam forced by 4-point shear, crack-height growth in Marcellus shale under the hydraulic fracturing and deformations of dam structures made from fiber reinforced concrete material is addressed.

In particular, an unsupervised background searching method is firstly conducted on the original HSIs to search the background spectral samples. Our proposed SBEM consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a discriminator to thoroughly capture background distribution. Furthermore, jointly minimizing the reconstruction loss, spectral loss, and adversarial loss during training aids the model to learn the background distribution as required.

The improvement of belowground plant efficiency has potential to further increase food production. However, belowground plant roots are harder to study, due to inherent challenges presented by root phenotyping. Several tools for identifying root anatomical features in root cross-section images have been proposed. However, existing tools are not fully automated and require significant human effort to produce accurate results. To address this limitation, we use a fully automated approach, specifically, the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), to identify anatomical traits in root cross-section images. By training Faster R-CNN models on root cross-section images, we can detect objects such as root, stele and late metaxylem, and predict rectangular bounding boxes around such objects. Subsequently, the bounding boxes can be used to estimate the root diameter, stele diameter, late metaxylem number, and average diameter. Experimental evaluation using standard object detection metrics, such as intersection-over-union and mean average precision, has shown that the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice root cross-section images can accurately detect root, stele and late metaxylem objects. Furthermore, the results have shown that the measurements estimated based on predicted bounding boxes have small root mean square error when compared with the corresponding ground truth values, suggesting that Faster R-CNN can be used to accurately detect anatomical features. Finally, a comparison with Mask R-CNN, an instance segmentation approach, has shown that the Faster R-CNN network produces overall better results given a small training set.

However, most of existing shared controllers have paid less attention to the effects caused by subjects with different levels of brain control ability.Approach.In this paper, a brain state evaluation network, termed BSE-NET, is proposed to evaluate subjects' brain control ability online based on quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning. With the output of BSE-NET (confidence score), a shared controller is designed to dynamically adjust the control weight between robot autonomy and human operator.Main results.The experimental results show that most of subjects achieved high and stable experimental success rate of approximately 90%. Furthermore, for subjects with different accuracy on EEG decoding, a proper confidence score can be dynamically generated to reflect their levels of brain control ability, and the proposed system can effectively adjust the control weight in all-time shared control.Significance.We discuss how our proposed method shows promise for BCI applications that can evaluate subjects' brain control ability online as well as provide a method for the research on self-adaptive shared control to adaptively balance control weight between subject's instruction and robot autonomy.","brain computer interface,brain control ability,self-adaptive shared control,human-wheelchair cooperation",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology",,5.484,"COMPUTER-INTERFACE,ACTUATED,WHEELCHAIR,COMMUNICATION,MOVEMENT,SPEED,EEG",JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING,,

This has driven a significant research effort aimed at better understanding and improving processing controls - yielding a plethora of in-situ measurements aimed at correlating defects with material quality metrics of interest. In this work, we develop machine-learning methods to learn correlations between thermal history and subsurface porosity for a variety of print conditions in laser powder bed fusion. Un-normalized surface temperatures (in the form of black-body radiances) are obtained using high-speed infrared imaging and porosity formation is observed in the sample cross-section through synchrotron x-ray imaging.

Here, we present an inspection pipeline that integrates (i) fast, micro X-ray computed tomography reconstruction, (ii) automated 3D morphology analysis, and (iii) machine learning-based big data analysis. X-ray computed tomography and automated computer vision result in a holistic defect morphology database for the inspected macroscopic volume, based on which machine learning analysis is employed to reveal quantitative insights into the global evolution of defect characteristics beyond qualitative human observations. We demonstrate this pipeline by examining the global-scale pore evolution in post-processing of binder jetting additive manufacturing, from the green state, to the sintered state, and to the hot isostatic pressed state of copper. The pipeline is shown to be effective at detecting and processing the information associated with a large number (similar to 10(5)) of pores in macroscopic volumes. The subsequent principal component analysis and clustering analysis extract the key morphological descriptors and categorize the detected pores into four morphological groups. By quantifying the evolution of (i) the weight of pore morphology parameters and (ii) the pore number and volume fraction of each categorized group, new understandings are developed regarding the effects of sintering and hot isostatic pressing on pore decomposition, shrinkage, and smoothing during post-processing of binder jetting.","Binder jetting,Pore analysis,X-ray computed tomography,Computer vision,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Materials Science",,12.363,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,MICROTOMOGRAPHY,CHARACTERIZATION,MICROSTRUCTURAL,EVOLUTION,SIZE,DISTRIBUTION,ALLOY,PARTS,MODEL,STANDARDIZATION,QUALIFICATION",ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S2214860420305558,

A few more generalized ways are to apply Hilbert transform or complex wavelet convolution. However, they are limited to single-dimensional signals, and they require the input window to cover multiple signal periods to extract a smooth phase sequence. In this work, we propose a learning-based phase extraction method for multi-dimensional signals, consuming only unlabeled signal examples for training. A neural network architecture is designed to map a window of signal directly to a phase value under a key constraint that encourages two consecutive phase values to progress forward. The concept has been generalized to a broad range of applications with an adjustable input window, a flexible phase progression penalty design, and better training stability. The proposed method consistently outperforms the complex wavelet convolution in three synthetic signals by reducing the phase extraction error by 63% while shortening the size of the observation window by over 90%. An experiment with an augmented electrocardiogram (ECG) signal also produces a clean phase sequence with an input window that is over thirty times smaller. A qualitative test on eleven-dimensional kinematic signals from three repetitive upper limb movements has shown that the method can also capture the fluctuation in phase progression. With the flexibility, the labelless training, the accuracy, and the short observation window, this technique has a potential to be used in a variety of applications that need instantaneous phase extraction.

Moreover, the simple use of artificial feature extraction methods has low universality. For example, it is unsuitable for cervical cell recognition because of the complexity of the cervical cell texture and the large individual differences between cells. Using the convolutional neural network classification method is a good way to solve this problem. However, although the cell features can be extracted automatically, the cervical cell domain knowledge will be lost, and the corresponding features of different cell types will be missing; hence, the classification effect is not sufficiently accurate. Aiming at addressing the limitations of the two mentioned classification methods, this paper proposes a cell classification algorithm that combines Inception v3 and artificial features, which effectively improves the accuracy of cervical cell recognition. In addition, to address the under-fitting problem and carry out effective deep learning training with a relatively small amount of medical data, this paper inherits the strong learning ability from transfer learning, and achieves accurate and effective cervical cell image classification based on the Herlev dataset. Using this method, an accuracy of more than 98% is achieved, providing an effective framework for computer aided diagnosis of cervical cancer. The proposed algorithm has good universality, low complexity, and high accuracy, rendering it suitable for further extension and application to the classification of other types of cancer cells.

Hence the foetal electrocardiogram signal is not preferred to execute the analysis to monitor the Foetal condition. Other traditional methods are being used to access the foetal condition. The foetal electrocardiogram signal can be acquired either by using invasive or non-invasive techniques. Since the invasive technique is harmful for the foetus, non-invasive technique is mostly adopted. The foetal electrocardiogram signal can be acquired only after twenty five weeks the foetus is developed in the womb, which is referred as the Antepartum period. This article portrays the use of Deep learning techniques for non-invasive foetal electrocardiogram signal synthesis using artificial intelligent techniques. Convolutional neural network (CNN), Deep belief neural networks (BNN) and Back propagation Neural Network (BPNN) have been utilized and tested for the proposal.

The failure types, i.e., flexure, shear, or mix of the above two, will greatly affect the capacity and ductility of the structure. Meanwhile, the design methodologies for structures of different failure types will be totally different. Therefore, developing efficient and reliable methods to identify the FM and predict the corresponding capacity is of special importance for structural design/assessment management. In this paper, an intelligent approach is presented for FM classification and bearing capacity prediction of RC columns based on the ensemble machine learning techniques. The most typical ensemble learning method, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, is adopted for both classification and regression (prediction) problems. Totally 254 cyclic loading tests of RC columns are collected. The geometric dimensions, reinforcing details, material properties are set as the input variables, while the failure types (for classification problem) and peak capacity forces (for regression problem) are set as the output variables. The results indicate that the model generated by the AdaBoost learning algorithm has a very high accuracy for both FM classification (accuracy = 0.96) and capacity prediction (R-2 = 0.98). Different learning algorithms are also compared and the results show that ensemble learning (especially AdaBoost) has better performance than single learning. In addition, the bearing capacity predicted by the AdaBoost is also compared to that by the empirical formulas provided by the design codes, which shows an obvious superior of the proposed method. In summary, the machine learning technique, especially the ensemble learning, can provide an alternate to the conventional mechanics-driven models in structural design in this big data time.","Machine learning,Ensemble learning,Adaptive boosting,Classification,Regression,Reinforced concrete,Column,Flexure,Shear",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,5.936,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,SELF-COMPACTING,CONCRETE,COMPRESSION-FIELD-THEORY,SOFTENED,TRUSS,MODEL,SHEAR-STRENGTH,OPTIMIZATION,ADABOOST.RT,PERFORMANCE,METAMODEL,MEMBERS",ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,,

Pushing, pulling, and carrying movements-which are all activities largely associated with physical loads-account for 35% of WMSDs. However, most previous studies have focused on the identification of non-ergonomic postures, and there has been limited effort expended on measuring a worker's exposures to the physical loads caused by materials or tools during construction tasks. With the advantage of using a wearable inertial measurement sensor to monitor a worker's bodily movements, this study investigates the feasibility of identifying various physical loading conditions by analyzing a worker's lower body movements. In the experiment with laboratory settings, workers performed a load carrying task by moving concrete bricks. A bidirectional long short-term memory algorithm is employed to classify physical load levels; this approach achieved 74.6 to 98.6% accuracy and 0.59 to 0.99 F-score in classification.

In existing studies, subjective and objective assessments of surgical operation skills use a variety of indicators, such as the operation speed and operation smoothness. However, the vascular conditions of particular patients have not been considered in the assessment, leading to deviations in the evaluation. Therefore, in this paper, an operation skills assessment method including the vascular difficulty level index for catheter insertion at the aortic arch in endovascular surgery is proposed. First, the model describing the difficulty of the vascular anatomical structure is established with characteristics of different aortic arch branches based on machine learning. Afterwards, the vascular difficulty level is set as an objective index combined with operating characteristics extracted from the operations performed by surgeons to evaluate the surgical operation skills at the aortic arch using machine learning. The accuracy of the assessment improves from 86.67 to 96.67% after inclusion of the vascular difficulty as an evaluation indicator to more objectively and accurately evaluate skills. The method described in this paper can be adopted to train novice surgeons in endovascular surgery, and for studies of vascular interventional surgery robots.

Due to the process uncertainties (such as changes of raw materials, abrasion of mechanic components, catalyst deactivation, changes in the external environment, etc), data distribution of process data in FCCU is time-varying, which leads to accuracy degradation of the quality prediction model. Therefore, to deal with the time varying characteristic of process data and avoid accuracy degradation of the quality prediction model, real-time processing should be considered. In this paper, an enhancing incremental deep learning approach is proposed for the online quality prediction of the absorption-stabilization system in FCCU. First, the offline model is built by Stacked Auto Encoder-Deep Neural Network (SAE-DNN). To determine whether the data distribution has changed and model modification is needed, a concept drift detector is proposed for the regression problem by defining an error bound in the Statistical Test of Equal Proportions (STEPD). If the model modification is needed, then the top layer of the offline SAE-DNN model is expanded by Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) structure, and the parameters in the expansion layer is dynamically assigned by the new coming data with the group lasso regularization and the L2 regularization. The proposed approach is validated by predicting the Saturated Vapor Pressure (SVP) of stabilized gasoline in the FCCU. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can deal with the time-varying characteristic of process data and avoid accuracy degradation under process uncertainties.

The semantic classification is then used to interpret a change mask and identify: new buildings, the creation of open spaces, and incremental roof upgrading in an informal settlement. The methodology is demonstrated on UAV imagery of an informal settlement in Kigali, Rwanda, successfully identifying changes between 2015 and 2017 with an Overall Accuracy of 95 % and correctly interpreting changes with an Overall Accuracy of 91 %. Results reveal that almost half the buildings in the settlement show visible changes in the roofing material, and 61 % of these changed less than 1m(2). This demonstrates the incremental nature of housing improvements in the settlement.","Change detection algorithms,Image analysis,Unmanned aerial vehicles,Urban planning,Informal settlements",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Remote Sensing,,6.225,"CLASSIFICATION,FEATURES,INDEXES",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/181965402/1_s2.0_S0303243419309900_main.pdf,

Most biomedical semantic segmentation frameworks comprise the encoder-decoder architecture directly fusing features of the encoder and the decoder by the way of skip connections. However, the simple fusion operation may neglect the semantic gaps which lie between these features in the decoder and the encoder, hindering the effectiveness of the network. Methods Dense gate network (DG-Net) is proposed for biomedical image segmentation. In this model, the Gate Aggregate structure is utilized to reduce the semantic gaps between features in the encoder and the corresponding features in the decoder, and the gate unit is used to reduce the categorical ambiguity as well as to guide the low-level high-resolution features to recover semantic information. Through this method, the features could reach a similar semantic level before fusion, which is helpful for reducing semantic gaps, thereby producing accurate results. Results Four medical semantic segmentation experiments, based on CT and microscopy images datasets, were performed to evaluate our model. In the cross-validation experiments, the proposed method achievesIOUscores of 97.953%, 89.569%, 81.870% and 76.486% on these four datasets. Compared with U-Net and MultiResUNet methods, DG-Net yields a higher average score onIOUandAcc. Conclusion The DG-Net is competitive with the baseline methods. The experiment results indicate that Gate Aggregate structure and gate unit could improve the performance of the network by aggregating features from different layers and reducing the semantic gaps of features in the encoder and the decoder. This has potential in biomedical image segmentation.","Convolution neural networks,Semantic segmentation,Biomedical images,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

In this paper, a ROP management study has been conducted for a well in Southwest of Iran. As a part of this study, the best approach for ROP prediction was determined by comparing the performance of several methods and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was implemented for optimization of ROP. This paper highlights the effects of formation thickness and the magnitude of working data-set on the performance of different algorithms which are being used for ROP management studies, especially in horizontal and inclined wells. This topic has special importance, when the results show a massive difference in thin and thick formations for some ROP prediction methods. Comparing the results of different ROP prediction methods showed that hybrid Bingham model has the best performance in ROP prediction; only if a powerful mathematical tool like trust-region method is being used for the determination of its unknown coefficients. This superiority was not generalized in all individual formations and there were different results in the cases of thin and thick formations; so, application of the bag-of-algorithms strategy by using the most accurate method in each formation is suggested for the prediction of ROP. Performing this ROP management project resulted in the prediction of ROP with a total relative error of 13.59% and also 48.30% improvement in ROP.","Rate of penetration,Machine learning,Deterministic models,Data-driven methods,Trust-region method,Particle swarm optimization algorithm",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,4.376,"RANDOM,FORESTS,REGRESSION,TREES,DECISION,TREES,DRILLING,EFFICIENCY,NEURAL-NETWORKS,IN-FIELD,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION,OPTIMIZATION",JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,,

Previous studies have leveraged reaction time (RT) as the metric for mental fatigue and aim at estimating the exact value of RT using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals within a regression model. However, due to the easily corrupted and also nonsmooth properties of RTs during data collection, methods focusing on predicting the exact value of a noisy measurement, RT generally suffer from poor generalization performance. Considering that human RT is the reflection of brain dynamics preference (BDP) rather than a single regression output of EEG signals, we propose a novel channel-reliability-aware ranking (CArank) model for the multichannel ranking problem. CArank learns from BDPs using EEG data robustly and aims at preserving the ordering corresponding to RTs. In particular, we introduce a transition matrix to characterize the reliability of each channel used in the EEG data, which helps in learning with BDPs only from informative EEG channels. To handle large-scale EEG signals, we propose a stochastic-generalized expectation maximum (SGEM) algorithm to update CArank in an online fashion. Comprehensive empirical analysis on EEG signals from 40 participants shows that our CArank achieves substantial improvements in reliability while simultaneously detecting noisy or less informative EEG channels.","DRIVER FATIGUE,EEG,ALGORITHM,TIME,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION,SYSTEM",Article,"MIT PRESS, ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA","Computer Science,Neurosciences & Neurology",,,"DRIVER,FATIGUE,EEG,ALGORITHM,TIME,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION,SYSTEM",NEURAL COMPUTATION,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/141771/2/NC_Submission.pdf,

Research on this disease has become very important because early diagnosis stages, clinical applications and the speed of response to treatment are facilitated in diseases such as cancer. In this study, an approach is proposed in which a Subspace kNN algorithm is used together with Stacked autoencoder (SAE) for diagnosis of disease on the breast cancer microarray dataset for the first time. Such hybrid approaches can provide better results when classifying data sets with high-dimensional and uncertainty. The data set used in the study was taken from Kent Ridge-2 database. It consists of 97 samples (51 benign, 46 malicious) and 24482 attributes. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated and the results were compared with other well-known methods of dimension reduction and machine learning. As a result of the comparison, the data set was reduced to 100 attributes by using SAE and Subspace kNN and 91.24% accuracy was achieved. The result obtained provides important classification accuracy, especially in high-dimensional data sets. The importance of this study is that the models that were created by using various classifiers to increase the success rate of the stacked autoencoder-softmax classifier model in the breast cancer microarray data set were applied for the first time. In this regard, it is considered that automation-based studies will provide diagnostic decision support system a solution using the proposed method in future works. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A conventional approach to discovering new HEAs requires scavenging an enormous search space consisting of over half a trillion new material compositions comprising of three to six principal elements. Machine learning has emerged as a potential tool to rapidly accelerate the search for and design of new materials, due to its rapidity, scalability, and now, reasonably accurate material property predictions. Here, we implement machine learning tools, to predict the crystallographic phase and Young's modulus of low-, medium- and high-entropy alloys composed of a family of 5 refractory elements. Our results, in conjunction with experimental validation, reveal that the mean melting point and electronegativity difference exert the strongest contributions to the phase formation in these alloys, while the melting temperature and the enthalpy of mixing are the key features impacting the Young's modulus of these materials. Additionally, and more importantly, we find that the entropy of mixing only negligibly influences the phase or the Young's modulus, reigniting the issue of its actual impact on the material phase and properties of HEAs.

We refer to visually-recognizable material properties as visual material attributes. Recognizing these attributes in images can provide valuable information for scene understanding and material recognition. Unlike typical object and scene attributes, however, visual material attributes are local (i.e., ""fuzziness"" does not have a shape). Given full supervision, we may accurately recognize such attributes from purely local information (small image patches). Obtaining consistent full supervision at scale, however, is challenging. To solve this problem, we probe the human visual perception of materials. By asking simple yes/no questions comparing pairs of image patches, we obtain the weak supervision required to build a set of classifiers for attributes that, while unnamed, function similarly to the attributes with which we describe materials. Furthermore, we integrate this method in the end-to-end learning of a CNN that simultaneously recognizes materials and their visual attributes.

The multiple output-models are formulated using two basic neural network models, which are artificial neural network (ANN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). These models are intended to capture the non-linear relationship between the inputs consisting of shear strain and magnetic flux density and outputs, which are storage modulus and loss factor. The optimized model is firstly identified by varying the model parameters, such as the number of hidden nodes and activation functions for both proposed prediction models. Then, the model performances were evaluated for training and testing data sets. The results showed that ANN and ELM prediction models had performed differently on two different outputs. The performance of the ANN prediction model was significant in predicting storage modulus where the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) of testing data out of modeling data sets were 0.012 MPa and 0.984 respectively. Meanwhile, the ELM model shows good agreement in predicting loss factor where the RMSE and R(2)were 0.007 MPa and 0.989, respectively.

Results indicate that features extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN) represent microstructure image data well, and segmentation via k-means clustering agree well with manually annotated images. Classification accuracy of original and segmented images is both 94% for a 5-class classification problem. Kinetic modeling results are consistent with previously reported data that employed manual thresholding. The image quantification and kinetic modeling approach developed and presented here aims to reduce researcher bias introduced into the characterization process, and allows for efficiently leveraging information in limited, unbalanced image data sets.","Machine learning,Computer vision,Image segmentation,K-means,CNN,U-10Mo,Microstructure,Metallography,Phase transformation,Discontinuous precipitation,JMAK,Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MULTILAYER,PERCEPTRON,IRRADIATION,BEHAVIOR,COMPUTER,VISION,ALPHA-URANIUM,TRANSFORMATION,ALLOY,CONDUCTIVITY,EQUILIBRIUM,PREDICTION",MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05496,

Deformation monitoring and safety operation of CFRDs is of great significance in ensuring the safety of human life and property in downstream areas. A new prediction model for the horizontal displacement of CFRDs, the statistically optimized back-propagation neural network model, was proposed by combining a statistical model and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model, which was applied to Deze Dam, Yunnan Province, Southwest China. First, the thermometer selection method is improved based on the correlation coefficients between the measured values of thermometers and the horizontal displacement. Further, combined with water level and time factors, three thermometers with large correlation coefficients were selected and applied to Deze Dam's model training. On this basis, an improved statistical model for the horizontal displacement of CFRDs is proposed. Subsequently, prediction results of the improved statistical model are taken as an input vector of the traditional BPNN model. Then the statistically optimized BPNN model, a combination of the improved statistical model and BPNN model, is proposed to predict the horizontal displacement of CFRDs. Compared with the improved statistical model and the BPNN model, the statistically optimized BPNN model has a higher prediction accuracy and a strong nonlinear prediction capability, which can compensate for the errors of statistical models and overcome the defects of overfitting and local minima. In addition, the statistically optimized BPNN model proved to have a strong generalization capability by changing the training sample sizes.

In particular, recent machine-learning potentials have advanced microscopic understanding of crystallization behavior of phase change materials by overcoming the computational limit of the density functional theory (DFT). Here we develop neural network potentials (NNP) for GeTe, an archetypal phase change material, and study the crystallization of amorphous GeTe. Consistently with the previous literature, we find that NNP results in a very short incubation time and the crystallization completes within a few nanoseconds, which is at variance with experimental measurement as well as DFT simulations. We show that such deficiencies of NNP originate from overly flat fourfold rings in the amorphous structure. By including explicitly relaxation paths from flat to puckered fourfold rings, we generate a modified NNP, which produces medium-range orders that are more consistent with DFT. Using the modified NNP, crystallization simulations are performed at two densities that represent partially or fully amorphized devices, and temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 K. At both densities, finite incubation times are clearly observed. In particular, the incubation time under the partially amorphized device condition is found to be 7 or 17 ns, which is consistent with experiments. By proposing a method to develop NNPs with correct medium-range order, this work will contribute to simulating phase change materials more accurately and realistically.","Neural network potential,GeTe,Phase change memory,Crystallization",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.222,"SUPERCOOLED,LIQUID-STATE,PHASE-CHANGE,MATERIALS,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SPEED,PERFORMANCE,ORIGIN,ENERGY",COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,,

The first advancement is based on a neural network (NN) approach to predict the initial position of minority and majority ions prior to DFT relaxation. The second advancement is to allow the NN to predict the total energy for every possibility minority ion position and select the most stable configuration in the absence of relaxing each trial minority configuration. A bismuth oxide materials system, (BixLayYbz)(2) MoO6, was used as the model system to demonstrate the developed methods and quantify the resulting computational speedup. Compared to a brute force method that requires the calculation of every permutation of minority configuration and subsequent DFT relaxation, a 1.3 x speedup was realized if the NN predicted the initial configuration of ions prior to relaxation. Implementation of the second advancement allowed the NN to predict the total energy for all possible trial configurations and downselect the most stable configurations prior to relaxation, resulting in a speedup of approximately 37 x. Validation was done by comparing position and energy between the NN and DFT predictions. A maximum position vector mean squared error (MSE) of 1.6 x 10(-2) and a maximum energy MSE of 2.3 x 10(-7) was predicted for the worst case configuration.

In this work, we propose a novel weighted maximum relevance minimum redundancy waveband selection algorithm. The relative importance between redundancy and relevance is better balanced by introducing a weight coefficient. The mutual information between wavebands and target classes and wavebands based on the neighbourhood rough set theory were calculated using the proposed algorithm. Using the forward greedy search algorithm, the wavebands with maximum relevance to target classes and minimum redundancy to previously selected wavebands were selected. In the classification of soybean hyperspectral imaging datasets, weighted maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithms with an equal weight and an unequal weight both performed well in terms of classification accuracy. The classification performances of the extreme learning machine classifiers are satisfactory. The average classification accuracy mostly exceeds 95%, when the neighbourhood size is greater than 0.12. In addition to classification accuracy, the stability of the algorithm under small perturbations was studied. The stability decreases as the perturbation level increases. The proposed algorithm is more stable with an unequal weight than with an equal weight. By applying the proposed algorithm, the weight coefficient can be selected flexibly to achieve optimum performance (the best stability, best classification performance, and smallest size of subsets), instead of limiting the algorithm to a fixed equal weight for relevance and redundancy.","hyperspectral imaging,waveband selection,maximum relevance,minimum redundancy,rough set",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,2.11,"MUTUAL,INFORMATION,BAND,SELECTION,MAX-DEPENDENCY,CLASSIFICATION,REDUCTION,CRITERIA",MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,,

The first method, the design response grammar, uses design rules-configurable by parameters-to develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the structural system under development. The second method, design via optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization) and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation, which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density distribution of each individual structural component, which can be regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case study, the study shows that-after optimization-the fronts remain the same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the generalization that is established in the first case study by using the found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the computational cost. As such it is concluded that the design response grammar is a promising support tool for the exploration and structural assessment of conceptual building spatial designs. Future research should focus on more types of structural elements; more objectives; new constraints to ensure feasible solutions, especially stress constraints; and the application of state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning to find more generalizations.","Building spatial design,Multi-disciplinary design,Design grammar,Structural design,Automated design,Design optimization,Conceptual design",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,8.0,"BUILDING,SPATIAL,DESIGN,MULTIDISCIPLINARY,DESIGN,ARCHITECTURAL,DESIGN,ENERGY,PERFORMANCE,OPTIMIZATION,SIMULATION,METHODOLOGY,STRATEGIES,MODEL,BIM",AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3185459/view,

Geomorphometric analysis revealed surface stoniness to be diagnostic of moraine hummocks. It was utilized to detect true moraine hummocks from among the potential hummocks delineated using object-based image analysis with logistic regression of curvature features derived from the digital elevation model (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, AUC = 0.77). Based on the electrical-sedimentary anisotropy data, the Kemijarvi moraine is polygenetic such that the ridges are diagonally and erosionally fluted (from sector 280-290 degrees) on their surfaces, while the ridge cores are deposited from the NW (from sector 310-340 degrees). The cores are composed of infill gravels and crudely stratified diamict sequences. We consider the core of the Kemijarvi hummocky moraine field to represent pre-existing (Early Weichselian) subglacial ridges rather than being generated through monogenetic (Late Weichselian) compressional shearing and stacking, frozen-bed extension, or bed ribbing instability mechanisms, as presented for ribbed moraines that are transverse to ice flow. Recently, evidence has been presented of multiple slip events (earthquakes with moment magnitudes M-w approximate to 6.7-7.0) up-ice from Kemijarvi. We therefore propose that the genesis of the hummocks may be associated with past (Early Weichselian) fault instability within glacio-isostatic adjustment(s), which was able to generate subglacial water bodies (possibly lakes) and saturated materials that were forced towards the SE. Based on this new geomorphological evidence from mapping using a digital elevation model derived from airborne laser scanning data and azimuthal conductivity surveys combined with the reinterpretation of previously presented geophysics and sedimentological observations, we suggest the Kemijarvi hummocky moraine field to be reconsidered as the Kemijarvi subglacial mass -flow field, which holds significant potential for construction aggregate materials.

Electronic barcoding of micro-particles has the possibility to enable multiplexed biomarker analysis. Compared with traditional optical and plasmonic methods for barcoding, electronically barcoded particles can be classified using ultra-compact electronic readout platforms. Nano-electronic barcoding works by depositing a thin layer of oxide on the top half of a micro-particle. The thickness and dielectric property of the oxide layer can be tuned to modulate the frequency dependent impedance signature of the particles. A one to one correspondence between a target biomarker and each barcoded particle can potentially be established using this technique. The barcoded particles could be tested with wearable devices to enable multiplex analysis for portable point-of-care diagnostics and real-time monitoring.

Low solubility of cVLP vaccine candidates is a challenge that can prevent development of these very substances. Solubility of cVLPs is typically assessed empirically, leading to high time and material requirements. Prediction of cVLP solubilityin silicocan aid in reducing this effort. Protein aggregation by hydrophobic interaction is an important factor driving protein insolubility. In this article, a recently developed soft ensemble vote classifier (sEVC) for the prediction of cVLP solubility was used based on 91 literature amino acid hydrophobicity scales. Optimization algorithms were developed to boost model performance, and the model was redesigned as a regression tool for ammonium sulfate concentration required for cVLP precipitation. The present dataset consists of 568 cVLPs, created by insertion of 71 different peptide sequences using eight different insertion strategies. Two optimization algorithms were developed that (I) modified the sEVC with regard to systematic misclassification based on the different insertion strategies, and (II) modified the amino acid hydrophobicity scale tables to improve classification. The second algorithm was additionally used to synthesize scales from random vectors. Compared to the unmodified model, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and accuracy of the test set predictions could be elevated from 0.63 and 0.81 to 0.77 and 0.88, respectively, for the best models. This improved performance compared to literature scales was suggested to be due to a decreased correlation between synthesized scales. In these, tryptophan was identified as the most hydrophobic amino acid, i.e., the amino acid most problematic for cVLP solubility, supported by previous literature findings. As a case study, the sEVC was redesigned as a regression tool and applied to determine ammonium sulfate concentrations for the precipitation of cVLPs. This was evaluated with a small dataset of ten cVLPs resulting in anR(2)of 0.69. In summary, we propose optimization algorithms that improve sEVC model performance for the prediction of cVLP solubility, allow for the synthesis of amino acid scale tables, and further evaluate the sEVC as regression tool to predict cVLP-precipitating ammonium sulfate concentrations.","virus-like particles,solubility,hydrophobicity scales,machine learning,precipitation,optimization",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"SEQUENCE-BASED,PREDICTION,PROTEIN,SOLUBILITY,VACCINE,HBCAG",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00881/pdf,

Industrial cream cheese production involves the complex scheduling of multiple batch fermenters and various downstream units. However, significant end-time variation from different fermentation batches makes downstream scheduling challenging and thus decreases the process throughput. RESULTS This research addressed this challenge by using an artificial neural network (a Long-Short Term Memory Network, LSTM) in combination with a mechanistic model describing the changes in biomass, lactose, and lactic acid concentrations. The LSTM network/mechanistic modelling approach shows an end-time difference of 3 min over batch times of 6 to 7 h compared to the laboratory experiment, with an overall accuracy (R-2) of over 0.99. CONCLUSION The proposed hybrid fundamental/artificial neural network (ANN) model framework could reasonably predict the cheese fermentation pH with limited data. The outcome of this research enables fermentation end-time prediction, makes the downstream scheduling possible, and thus, could help to improve the process throughput. The developed model could also be used for further cheese digital twin development, based on how better product quality control and higher process efficiency could be achieved.

However, the potential of machine learning has been limited in the field of materials science because of the difficulty in treating complex real-world information as a digital language. Here, we propose to use graph-shaped databases with a common format to describe almost any materials science experimental data digitally, including chemical structures, processes, properties, and natural languages. The graphs can express real world's data with little information loss. In our approach, a single neural network treats the versatile materials science data collected from over ten projects, whereas traditional approaches require individual models to be prepared to process each individual database and property. The multitask learning of miscellaneous factors increases the prediction accuracy of parameters synergistically by acquiring broad knowledge in the field. The integration is beneficial for developing general prediction models and for solving inverse problems in materials science. Traditionally, machine learning for materials science is based on database-specific models and is limited in the number of predictable parameters.

However, much of the clinical data is unstructured in the form of radiology reports, while the process of data collection and curation is arduous and time-consuming. Purpose We utilized a machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract clinical terms from unstructured radiology reports. Additionally, we investigate the prognostic value of the extracted data in predicting all-cause mortality (ACM) in HF patients. Materials and methods This observational cohort study utilized 122,025 thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) reports from 11,808 HF patients obtained between 2008 and 2018. 1,560 CT reports were manually annotated for the presence or absence of 14 radiographic findings, in addition to age and gender. Thereafter, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained, validated and tested to determine the presence or absence of these features. Further, the ability of CNN to predict ACM was evaluated using Cox regression analysis on the extracted features. Results 11,808 CT reports were analyzed from 11,808 patients (mean age 72.8 +/- 14.8 years; 52.7% (6,217/11,808) male) from whom 3,107 died during the 10.6-year follow-up. The CNN demonstrated excellent accuracy for retrieval of the 14 radiographic findings with area-under-the-curve (AUC) ranging between 0.83-1.00 (F1 score 0.84-0.97). Cox model showed the time-dependent AUC for predicting ACM was 0.747 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.704-0.790) at 30 days.

Its early diagnosis is crucial for the development of possible future treatment option(s). Structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) play an important role to help in understanding the anatomical changes related to AD especially in its early stages. Conventional methods require the expertise of domain experts and extract hand-picked features such as gray matter substructures and train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from healthy subjects. Different from these methods, this paper proposes to construct multiple deep 2D convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) to learn the various features from local brain images which are combined to make the final classification for AD diagnosis. The whole brain image was passed through two transfer learning architectures; Inception version 3 and Xception, as well as a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the help of separable convolutional layers which can automatically learn the generic features from imaging data for classification. Our study is conducted using cross-sectional T1-weighted structural MRI brain images from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database to maintain the size and contrast over different MRI scans.

While machine learning (ML) has been leveraged to aid the design or screen of MOFs for different purposes, the needs of big data are not always met, limiting the applicability of ML models trained against small data sets. In this work, we introduce an inductive transfer learning technique to improve the accuracy and applicability of ML models trained with a small amount of MOF adsorption data. This technique leverages potentially shareable knowledge from a source task to improve the models on the target tasks. As demonstrations, a deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on H-2 adsorption data with 13 506 MOF structures at 100 bar and 243 K is used as the source task. When transferring knowledge from the source task to H-2 adsorption at 100 bar and 130 K (one target task), the average predictive accuracy on target tasks was improved from 0.960 (direct training) to 0.991 (transfer learning), and transfer learning works in 89.3% of the cases.

More importantly, transfer learning is shown to effectively improve the models on the target tasks with low accuracy from direct training. However, when transferring the knowledge from the source task to Xe/Kr adsorption, the transfer learning does not improve the predictive accuracy significantly and even makes it worse in similar to 50.0% of the cases, which is attributed to the lack of common descriptors that is key to the underlying knowledge.","gas adsorption,metal-organic frameworks,textual descriptors,deep neural network,inductive transfer learning,permutation feature importance",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"MOLECULAR,SIMULATION,SURFACE-AREAS,ZEOLITES,SEPARATE,STORAGE,MOFS",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Transfer_Learning_Study_of_Gas_Adsorption_in_Metal_Organic_Frameworks/12659334/files/23890503.pdf,

In this way, the statistical ensemble is sampled exactly at the DFT level for a given thermodynamic condition. Meanwhile, the ML potential is improved on the fly by training to enhance the sampling, whereby the training data set, which is sampled from the exact ensemble, is created automatically.

Recently, researchers have demonstrated that machine learning models can automate this process to predict the coordinating environments of absorbing atoms from their XAS spectra. However, machine learning models are often difficult to interpret, making it challenging to determine when they are valid and whether they are consistent with physical theories. In this work, we present three main advances to the data-driven analysis of XAS spectra: we demonstrate the efficacy of random forests in solving two new property determination tasks (predicting Bader charge and mean nearest neighbor distance), we address how choices in data representation affect model interpretability and accuracy, and we show that multiscale featurization can elucidate the regions and trends in spectra that encode various local properties. The multiscale featurization transforms the spectrum into a vector of polynomial-fit features, and is contrasted with the commonly-used ""pointwise"" featurization that directly uses the entire spectrum as input. We find that across thousands of transition metal oxide spectra, the relative importance of features describing the curvature of the spectrum can be localized to individual energy ranges, and we can separate the importance of constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, as well as the white line energy. This work has the potential to assist rigorous theoretical interpretations, expedite experimental data collection, and automate analysis of XAS spectra, thus accelerating the discovery of new functional materials.","SILICATE-GLASSES,OXIDATION-STATE,XANES SPECTRA,COORDINATION,METAL,EXPERIMENTATION,SPECTROSCOPY,CATALYSTS,LIGAND,EXAFS",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"SILICATE-GLASSES,OXIDATION-STATE,XANES,SPECTRA,COORDINATION,METAL,EXPERIMENTATION,SPECTROSCOPY,CATALYSTS,LIGAND,EXAFS",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://escholarship.org/content/qt14z7s21w/qt14z7s21w.pdf?t=qmm78x,

The performance results indicated excellent prediction ability of the neural network. Experiments were conducted to improve the model, and the relative importance of the different factors was evaluated. Gradation and air voids were identified as two of the primary factors affecting field permeability. It is recommended that ANNs be considered to be used on a regular basis for predicting field permeability, particularly because field permeability tests are processes that require a considerable amount of time and resources.","Pavement,permeability,artificial neural network,gradation,air voids",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Materials Science",,4.03,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING,,

To improve the productivity of the inspection work, this study develops a hybrid intelligence approach that combines image texture analysis, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. Image texture computations employ the Gabor filter and gray-level run lengths to characterize the condition of a concrete surface. Based on features of image texture, Support Vector Machines (SVM) establish a decision boundary that separates collected image samples into two categories of no surface void (negative class) and surface void (positive class). Furthermore, to assist the SVM model training phase, the state-of-the-art history-based adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) is utilized. The hybrid intelligence approach, named as L-SHADE-SVM-SVD, has been developed and complied in Visual C#.NET framework. Experiments with 1000 image samples show that the L-SHADE-SVM-SVD can obtain a high prediction accuracy of roughly 93%. Therefore, the newly developed model can be a promising alternative for construction inspectors in concrete quality assessment.","LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS,SYSTEM,QUANTIFICATION,INSPECTION,FRAMEWORK,BUGHOLES,FEATURES,QUALITY",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,,"LOCAL,BINARY,PATTERNS,SYSTEM,QUANTIFICATION,INSPECTION,FRAMEWORK,BUGHOLES,FEATURES,QUALITY",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4190682,

One of the requirements for TADF-based OLEDs having high external quantum efficiency (EQE) is the favorable energy level alignment between the host and the guest to promote the energy transfer and improve the carrier balance. However, strategies to optimize the TADF-based OLED performance by selecting suitable host-guest systems in the light-emitting layer are far from enough. In this work, we investigated guest-host systems through the use of two machine-learning approaches (feature-based and similarity-based algorithms) from our recent effort for the optimization of TADF-based OLEDs. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm based on the features of electronic and photo-physical properties can accurately predict the EQE of green TADF-based OLEDs with average correlation coefficients ofR(2)= 0.85 for the training set andR(2)= 0.74 for the testing set. Also, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm based on similarity metrics between pairs of materials (e.g., host and guest) in terms of electronic parameters can provide reasonable device performance prediction (R-2= 0.72) through the optimization procedure of the parameters. These results show that the predictive capability and model applicability of both machine-learning models can be used to identify suitable host-guest systems and explore complex relationships in green TADF-based OLEDs.","LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES,DELAYED FLUORESCENCE MATERIALS,HIGHLY EFFICIENT,DESIGN,PEROVSKITES,EMISSION,GAPS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,3.802,"LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES,DELAYED,FLUORESCENCE,MATERIALS,HIGHLY,EFFICIENT,DESIGN,PEROVSKITES,EMISSION,GAPS",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

For this purpose, target volumes and OARs have to be delineated and segmented from medical images. As manual delineation is a tedious and time-consuming task subjected to intra/interobserver variability, computerized auto-segmentation has been developed as an alternative. The field of medical imaging and RT planning has experienced an increased interest in the past decade, with new emerging trends that shifted the field of H&N OAR auto-segmentation from atlas-based to deep learning-based approaches. In this review, we systematically analyzed 78 relevant publications on auto-segmentation of OARs in the H&N region from 2008 to date, and provided critical discussions and recommendations from various perspectives:image modality- both computed tomography and magnetic resonance image modalities are being exploited, but the potential of the latter should be explored more in the future;OAR- the spinal cord, brainstem, and major salivary glands are the most studied OARs, but additional experiments should be conducted for several less studied soft tissue structures;image database- several image databases with the corresponding ground truth are currently available for methodology evaluation, but should be augmented with data from multiple observers and multiple institutions;methodology- current methods have shifted from atlas-based to deep learning auto-segmentation, which is expected to become even more sophisticated;ground truth- delineation guidelines should be followed and participation of multiple experts from multiple institutions is recommended;performance metrics- the Dice coefficient as the standard volumetric overlap metrics should be accompanied with at least one distance metrics, and combined with clinical acceptability scores and risk assessments;segmentation performance- the best performing methods achieve clinically acceptable auto-segmentation for several OARs, however, the dosimetric impact should be also studied to provide clinically relevant endpoints for RT planning.","auto-segmentation,deep learning,head and neck,organs at risk,radiotherapy planning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"AUTOMATIC,SEGMENTATION,CT,IMAGES,TARGET,VOLUMES,NASOPHARYNGEAL,CARCINOMA,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,INTEROBSERVER,VARIATION,RADIATION,ONCOLOGY,CONTOURING,METHOD,DELINEATION,REGISTRATION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach for the classification of multi-subject high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) data. In this EEG data, we have a matrix of covariates corresponding to each subject from either the alcoholic or control group. The matrix covariates have a natural spatial correlation based on the locations of the brain, and temporal correlation as the measurements are taken over time. We employ a divide and conquer strategy by building multiple local Bayesian models at each time point separately. We incorporate the spatial structure through the structured spike-and-slab prior, which has inherent variable selection properties. The temporal structure is incorporated within the prior by learning from the local model from the previous time point. We pool the information from the local models and use a weighted average to design a prediction method. We perform simulation studies to show the efficiency of our approach and demonstrate the local Bayesian modeling with a case study on EEG data.","Bayesian variable selection,Gibbs sampling,neuroimaging data,slice sampling,spatial clustering,spatio-temporal EEG",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Computer Science,Mathematics",,1.55,REGRESSION,STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,,

Considering that poorly differentiated colorectal glands cannot be accurately segmented, we propose an approach for segmentation of glands in colon cancer images, based on the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundaries. First, we use a U-net for stain separation to obtain H-stain, E-stain, and background stain intensity maps. Subsequently, epithelial nucleus is identified on the histopathology images, and the lumen segmentation is performed on the background intensity map. Then, we use the axis of least inertia-based similar triangles as the spatial characteristics of lumens and epithelial nucleus, and a triangle membership is used to select glandular contour candidates from epithelial nucleus. By connecting lumens and epithelial nucleus, more accurate gland segmentation is performed based on the rough gland boundary. The proposed stain separation approach is unsupervised, and the stain separation makes the category information contained in the H&E image easy to identify and deal with the uneven stain intensity and the inconspicuous stain difference. In this project, we use deep learning to achieve stain separation by predicting the stain coefficient. Under the deep learning framework, we design a stain coefficient interval model to improve the stain generalization performance. Another innovation is that we propose the combination of the internal lumen contour of adenoma and the outer contour of epithelial cells to obtain a precise gland contour. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against that of several state-of-the-art technologies on publicly available datasets. The results show that the segmentation approach combining the characteristics of lumens and rough gland boundary has better segmentation accuracy.","HISTOLOGY,CLASSIFICATION,MODEL",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Mathematics,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,2.8,"HISTOLOGY,CLASSIFICATION,MODEL",COMPLEXITY,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6180457,

Materials and methods Sixty-nine patients (mean age, 38.6 years; age range, 26-50 years) with adenomyosis treated by MRgFUS were reviewed and allocated to training (n = 48) and testing cohorts (n = 21). One thousand one hundred eighteen radiomics features were extracted from T-2-weighted imaging before MRgFUS. The radiomics features' dimension was reduced by Pearson correlation coefficient after normalization. Analysis of variance and logistical regression were used for feature selection by fivefold cross-validation in the training cohort, and the machine learning model was constructed for comparing the clinical model, radiomics model, and radiomics-clinical model which combined survived radiomics features and clinical parameters. The discrimination result of the model was obtained by bootstrap; receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and decision curve analyses were performed to illustrate the model performance in both the training and testing cohorts. Results Good response was achieved in 47 patients (68.1%) and failed in 22 patients (38.9%). The radiomics model comprised four selected features and demonstrated a degree of prediction capability of patients' poor response to MRgFUS treatment. The radiomics-clinical model showed good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.592-0.975) in the testing cohort. The decision curve analysis also showed favorable performance of the radiomics-clinical model. Conclusions A prediction model composed of T2WI-based radiomics features and clinical parameters could be applied to guide the radiologist to evaluate MRgFUS for patients with adenomyosis who will achieve good response.","Radiomics,Magnetic resonance imaging,Treatment outcome,Ultrasonic therapy,Adenomyosis",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.87,"DIAGNOSIS,IMAGES,WOMEN,US",EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,,

Here, we report a hybrid theoretical study for unraveling the regulation mechanism by combining classical density functional theory (CDFT) with machine learning (ML). Specifically, CDFT is employed to predict the solubility of argon in various solvents confined in nanopores of different types and pore widths, and these case studies then supply a valid training set to ML for further investigation. Finally, the dominant parameters that affect the gas solubility are identified, and a criterion is obtained to determine whether a confined gas-solvent system is enhance-beneficial or reduce-beneficial.

It provides vital clues to estimate the stage and the proliferation rate of end-stage kidney disease. IgA stage can be estimated with the help of MEST-C score. The manual estimation of MEST-C score from whole slide kidney images is a very tedious and difficult task. This study uses some Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) related models to detect mesangial hypercellularity (M score) in MEST-C. CNN learns the features directly from image data without the requirement of analytical data. CNN is trained efficiently when image data size is large enough for a particular class. In the case of smaller data size, transfer learning can be used efficiently in which CNN is pre-trained on some general images and then on subject images. Since the data set size is small, time spent in collecting large data set is saved. The training time of transfer learning is also reduced because the model is already pre-trained. This research work aims at the detection of mesangial hypercellularity from biopsy images with small data size by utilizing the transfer learning. The dataset used in this research work consists of 138 individual glomerulus (x 20 magnification digital biopsy) images of IgA patients received from All India Institute of Medical Science, Delhi. Here, machine learning (k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM)) classifiers are compared to transfer learning CNN methods. The deep extracted image features are used by machine learning classifiers. The different evaluation parameters have been used for comparing the predictions of basic classifiers to the deep learning model. The research work concludes that the transfer learning deep CNN method can improve the detection of mesangial hypercellularity as compare to KNN, SVM methods when using the small data set.
