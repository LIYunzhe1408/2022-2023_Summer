The goal was to improve outcomes: the health of mothers and their babies. The method was to implement a learning machine that becomes more useful over time and over task. A feasible set-up is here described, with the purpose of producing intelligible and useful results to healthcare professionals at the unit by means of a vision processing pipeline, grouped together with multi-modal capabilities of handling annotations and audio. Algorithmic bias turned out to be an obstacle that could only partly be handled by modern pipelines for automated feature analysis. The professional use of complex quantitative scoring for various mental health-related assessments further complicated the automation of laborious tasks. Activities during the MBU stay had previously been shown to decrease psychiatric symptoms across diagnostic groups. The implementation and first set of experiments on a learning machine for the unit produced the first steps toward explaining why this is so, in turn enabling decision support to staff about what to do more and what to do less of.","learning machine,machine learning,multi-modal learning,mental health,maternal unresponsiveness,mind-mindedness",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Psychology,,3.618,"FACIAL,EXPRESSION,RECOGNITION,HEALTH",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691596,

Here, we propose a deep learning architecture that systematically learns the input-output behavior of the Kohn-Sham equation and predicts the electronic density of states, a primary output of DFT calculations, with unprecedented speed and chemical accuracy. The algorithm also adapts and progressively improves in predictive power and versatility as it is exposed to new diverse atomic configurations. We demonstrate this capability for a diverse set of carbon allotropes spanning a large configurational and phase space. The electronic density of states, along with the electronic charge density, may be used downstream to predict a variety of materials properties, bypassing the Kohn-Sham equation, leading to an ultrafast and high-fidelity DFT emulator.","TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,DENSITY,LITHIUM,DESIGN",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,2.725,"TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,DENSITY,LITHIUM,DESIGN",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A,,

Natural vegetation development on mineral material substratum is an unappreciated way of site management. Due to the classification-based approach to assembly of plant community diversity, remote sensing methods have limited application. We aimed to assess whether remotely sensed data allow for building predictive models, able to recognise vegetation variability along the main gradients of species composition. We assessed vegetation in 321 study plots on four coal-mine spoil heaps in Silesia (S Poland). We determined the main gradients of species composition using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and we identified how DCA scores describe vegetation variability. DCA axes explained 38.5%, 35.4%, 31.4%, and 20.1% of species composition variability. We built machine learning models of DCA scores using multispectral satellite images and airborne laser scanning data as predictors. We obtained good predictive power of models for the first two DCA axes (R-2 = 0.393 and 0.443, root mean square errors, RMSE = 0.571 and 0.526) and low power for the third and fourth DCA axes (R-2 = 0.216 and 0.064, RMSE = 0.513 and 0.361). These scores allowed us to prepare a vegetation map based on DCA scores, and distinguish meadow-like from forest-edge-like vegetation, and to identify thermophilous and highly productive vegetation patches. Our approach allowed us to account for species composition gradients, which improved remote sensing-based vegetation surveys. This method may be used for planning future management.","coal mine,digital elevation model,ordination,random forest,vegetation continuum,WORLDVIEW&#8208,2",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Agriculture",,5.291,"PLANT,FUNCTIONAL,TYPES,SPONTANEOUS,SUCCESSION,SPECIES,COMPOSITION,SPOIL,HEAPS,BIOMASS,LAYER,LEAF,SPECTROSCOPY,REFLECTANCE,COMMUNITIES",LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,,

The reason is that electrolytes play important roles in different scientific disciplines, such as material development, technical processes (chemical industry, biotechnology, and pharma and food industries), and most recently the energy sector. Closely connected is the further development of advanced thermodynamic models. The age of digitalization requires robust physical models as the basis for static and dynamic process modeling, and that will provide the basis for surrogate approaches in future machine learning developments. This all brings thermodynamic modeling to a consideration of its most important feature. There are many thermodynamic approaches which have been developed to correlate, model, and predict the properties and phase behavior of electrolytes. Usually, this has been very successful for aqueous electrolyte solutions. However, for solutions with poor water content, electrolyte modeling is challenging. This mini-review summarizes the recent advance of thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions in a water-poor medium and suggests the required theoretical framework.",,Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Thermodynamics,Chemistry,Engineering",,2.685,,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA,,

Then classification results based on DRIVE databases are used as pseudo groundtruths to train the neural networks and transfer learning is considered for subsequent processing. Next the trained network is used as the feature extraction tool, by calculating and comparing the difference of image features between the target domain data (DRIVE database) and the source domain data (STARE, CHASE DB1, and HRF databases) extracted from the network. The data required for training is expanded based on semi-supervised clustering in this image feature space, finally the deep neural network is further fine-tuned.

The objective is to learn a policy that changes the size of the patches, and therefore the impedance in the sides of an artificially structured material. The proposed iterative model assigns the highest reward when the patch sizes allow the transmission along a constrained path and penalties when the patch sizes make the surface wave radiate to the sides of the metamaterial. After convergence, the proposed model learns an optimal patch pattern that achieves lateral confinement along the metasurface. Simulation results show that the proposed learned-pattern can effectively guide the electromagnetic wave through a metasurface, maintaining its instantaneous eigenstate when the homogeneity is perturbed.

Recently surgical instrument extraction methods from laparoscopic videos have been studied using deep learning, fuelling the creation of a large amount of training data for better performance. However, it is difficult to collect a massive amount of data on surgical instruments that are used infrequently during surgery. Their recognition accuracy may be reduced by the lack of training data. This paper solves this problem by increasing the training data with an image synthesis technique. Pairs of synthetic laparoscopic videos and their labelled data are automatically generated by superimposing 3D virtual surgical instrument models on real laparoscopic videos. The synthetic laparoscopic images are translated using CycleGAN so that the appearance of the surgical instruments closely resembles those in the real laparoscopic videos. Additionally, we extracted surgical instruments from laparoscopic videos using 2D U-Net based network. This network was trained using both the synthetic laparoscopic images and the manually labelled, real laparoscopic video data. The trained model extracted the surgical instruments from the laparoscopic videos. Our experimental result showed that the recognition accuracy of the surgical instruments, which are used infrequently during surgery, was improved using synthetic laparoscopic images generated by our proposed method.","Segmentation,image translation,laparoscopic surgery,synthetic image,virtual reality",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,,COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-IMAGING AND VISUALIZATION,,

Most modern information systems are developed on a modular base; therefore, a significant design stage is the implementation of links between system components. The purpose of the study is to automate the organization of intermodular interaction in information systems, which will reduce the complexity, time and cost of this implementing process. In order to achieve the result, a method is proposed for the organization of interaction between modules of information systems based on neural network data channels, realized within the general concept of a neural network architecture. The structure of neural network channels, the principles of their functioning, theoretical substantiation, mathematical and algorithmic support and area of application are considered in detail. A classification of neural network channels is presented, based on two of their characteristics: categories and degrees. As a result of the conducted research, the practical implementation of two neural network data channels is realized (transmission and adaptation), the structure of the program code, the used tools and libraries are analyzed. Based on a set of metrics for the complexity of the program code (Halstead, Jilb), the estimation of the computational complexity of algorithms, time and material costs for implementation, a comparative analysis of neural network data transmission channels and adaptation with classical approaches in the form of a set of network data transmission protocol and the required algorithmic support for data processing is carried out. The obtained experimental results confirm the lower complexity of neural network channels (reduction by at least 20% according to Halstead metrics and cyclometric complexity), reduction in time (by 12-32%) and cost (by 36-63%) of implementation and increase in the accuracy of the problem solving (by 11.8-15.5%).

The origins of specific compounds are known, including metabolites that are highly heritable(2,3), or those that are influenced by the gut microbiome(4), by lifestyle choices such as smoking(5), or by diet(6). However, the key determinants of most metabolites are still poorly understood. Here we measured the levels of 1,251 metabolites in serum samples from a unique and deeply phenotyped healthy human cohort of 491 individuals. We applied machine-learning algorithms to predict metabolite levels in held-out individuals on the basis of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters, diet, lifestyle and anthropometric measurements, and obtained statistically significant predictions for more than 76% of the profiled metabolites. Diet and microbiome had the strongest predictive power, and each explained hundreds of metabolites-in some cases, explaining more than 50% of the observed variance. We further validated microbiome-related predictions by showing a high replication rate in two geographically independent cohorts(7,8) that were not available to us when we trained the algorithms. We used feature attribution analysis(9) to reveal specific dietary and bacterial interactions. We further demonstrate that some of these interactions might be causal, as some metabolites that we predicted to be positively associated with bread were found to increase after a randomized clinical trial of bread intervention. Overall, our results reveal potential determinants of more than 800 metabolites, paving the way towards a mechanistic understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to designing interventions for manipulating the levels of circulating metabolites.
The levels of 1,251 metabolites are measured in 475 phenotyped individuals, and machine-learning algorithms reveal that diet and the microbiome are the determinants with the strongest predictive power for the levels of these metabolites.","UREMIC TOXINS,DISEASE,SUPPLEMENTATION,ENVIRONMENT,ALIGNMENT,BETAINE",Article,"NATURE PORTFOLIO, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,54.637,"UREMIC,TOXINS,DISEASE,SUPPLEMENTATION,ENVIRONMENT,ALIGNMENT,BETAINE",NATURE,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/146279090/Bar_et_al._2020.pdf,

For each nodule, four volumes of interest were defined using the gross tumor volume (GTV) and peritumoral volumes (PTVs) of 5, 10, and 15 mm around the tumor.RESULTS: Radiomics models created from GTV, GTV plus 5 mm of PTV, GTV plus 10 mm of PTV, and GTV plus 15 mm of PTV achieved AUCs of 0.89, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.73, respectively, in the validation cohort for the diagnostic classification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules.

However, this could also cause potential security threats and privacy risk as the deep learning algorithms need to access generated data collection, which lacks security in nature. This paper predominately focuses on developing a secure deep learning system design with the threat analysis involved within the smart farming technologies as they are acquiring more attention towards the global food supply needs with their intensifying demands. Smart farming is known to be a combination of data-driven technology and agricultural applications that helps in yielding quality food products with the enhancing crop yield. Nowadays, many use cases had been developed by executing smart farming paradigm and promote high impacts on the agricultural lands.","Deep learning,Smart farming,Differential privacy,Image processing,Feature extraction,Convolutional neural networks,Gradient descent",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Computer Science,,5.277,"THINGS,DOMAIN",COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40747-020-00225-5.pdf,

The emergence of new concrete mixtures and applications has motivated researchers to pursue reliable models for predicting mechanical strength. Empirical and statistical models, such as linear and nonlinear regression, have been widely used. However, these models require laborious experimental work to develop, and can provide inaccurate results when the relationships between concrete properties and mixture composition and curing conditions are complex. To overcome such drawbacks, several Machine Learning (ML) models have been proposed as an alternative approach for predicting the mechanical strength of concrete. The present study examines ML models for forecasting the mechanical properties of concrete, including artificial neural networks, support vector machine, decision trees, and evolutionary algorithms. The application of each model and its performance are critically discussed and analyzed, thus identifying practical recommendations, current knowledge gaps, and needed future research.
