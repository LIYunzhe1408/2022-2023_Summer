1,Machine-learning assisted laser powder bed fusion process optimization for AlSi10Mg: New microstructure description indices and fracture mechanisms,201,,316-328,"Liu Qian,Wu Hongkun,Paul Moses J.,He Peidong,Peng Zhongxiao,Gludovatz Bernd,Kruzic Jamie J.,Wang Chun H.,Li Xiaopeng","Liu Q,Wu HK,Paul MJ,He PD,Peng ZX,Gludovatz B,Kruzic JJ,Wang CH,Li XP",Li XP,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.10.010,University of New South Wales Sydney,"In this study, a machine-learning approach based on Gaussian process regression was developed to identify the optimized processing window for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Using this method, we found a new and much larger optimized LPBF processing window than was known before for manufacturing fully dense AlSi10Mg samples (i.e., relative density >= 99%). The newly determined optimized processing parameters (e.g., laser power and scan speed) made it possible to achieve previously unattainable combinations of high strength and ductility. The results showed that although the AlSi10Mg specimens exhibited similar Al-Si eutectic microstructures (e.g., cell structures in fine and coarse grains), they displayed large difference in their mechanical properties including hardness (118 137 HV 10), ultimate tensile strength (297 389 MPa), elongation to failure (6.3 10.3%), and fracture toughness (9.9 12.7 kJ/m(2)). The underlying reason was attributed to the subtle microstructural differences that were further revealed using two newly defined morphology indices (i.e., dimensional-scale index Id and shape index Is) based on several key microstructural features obtained from scanning electron microscopy images. It was found that in addition to grain structure, the sub-grain cell size and cell boundary morphology of the LPBF fabricated AlSi10Mg also strongly affected the mechanical properties of the material. The method established in this study can be readily applied to the LPBF process optimization and mechanical properties manipulation of other widely used metals and alloys or newly designed materials.

Materials and methods: Relevant clinical questions were proposed by French subspecialty colleges of radiology. Their feasibility was assessed by experts in the field of AI. A dedicated platform was set up for inclusion centers to safely upload their anonymized examinations in compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the database was checked by experts weekly with annotations performed by radiologists. Multidisciplinary teams competed between September 11th and October 13th 2019.
Results: Three questions were selected using different imaging and evaluation modalities, including: pulmonary nodule detection and classification from 3D computed tomography (CT), prediction of expanded disability status scale in multiple sclerosis using 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and segmentation of muscular surface for sarcopenia estimation from two-dimensional CT. A total of 4347 examinations were gathered of which only 6% were excluded. Three independent databases from 24 individual centers were created. A total of 143 participants were split into 20 multidisciplinary teams.
Conclusion: Three data challenges with over 1200 general data protection regulation compliant CT or MRI examinations each were organized. Future challenges should be made with more complex situations combining histopathological or genetic information to resemble real life situations faced by radiologists in routine practice.

Materials and methods: Our algorithm combined several complementary predictors: a pure deep learning predictor based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns from the images, as well as classical machine-learning predictors based on random forest regressors and manifold learning trained using the location of lesion load with respect to white matter tracts. The aggregation of the predictors was done through a weighted average taking into account prediction errors for different EDSS ranges. The training dataset consisted of 971 multiple sclerosis patients from the ""Observatoire francais de la sclerose en plaques"" (OFSEP) cohort with initial FLAIR MRI and corresponding EDSS score at two years. A test dataset (475 subjects) was provided without an EDSS score. Ten percent of the training dataset was used for validation.
Results: Our algorithm predicted EDSS score in patients with multiple sclerosis and achieved a MSE = 2.2 with the validation dataset and a MSE = 3 (mean EDSS error = 1.7) with the test dataset.
Conclusion: Our method predicts two-year clinical disability in patients with multiple sclerosis with a mean EDSS score error of 1.7, using FLAIR sequence and basic patient demographics. This supports the use of our model to predict EDSS score progression. These promising results should be further validated on an external validation cohort. (C) 2020 Societe francaise de radiologie.

This study aimed to build and validate 4 machine learning (ML) models to predict the occurrence of lymph node metastasis before and after surgery for early-stage (cT1N0 to cT2N0) OTSCC.
Materials and Methods: We designed a retrospective cross-sectional study and reviewed the clinical and pathologic records of patients with early-stage OTSCC. The sample was composed of 2 groups with different node status (positive or negative) and was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Four common ML algorithms-logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and naive Bayes-were used to predict pathologic nodal metastasis of early-stage OTSCC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess the performance of these models and conventional methods including depth of invasion (DOI), neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR), and tumor budding.
Results: A total of 145 patients (56 with positive and 89 with negative lymph nodes) were included in this study. The performance of ML models was significantly superior to that of conventional prediction methods. The random forest model performed best (AUC, 0.786; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 75%) and exceeded the performance of NLR (AUC, 0.539; sensitivity, 53.6%; specificity, 53.9%; P = .003). When DOI, worst pattern of invasion, lymphocytic host response, and tumor budding were added to model analysis according to patients' postoperative pathologic records, the support vector machine model performed best (AUC, 0.956; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 87.5%) and was superior to univariate assessment of tumor budding (AUC, 0.830; sensitivity, 80.9%; specificity, 87.5%, P = .002), DOI (AUC, 0.613; sensitivity, 91.1%; specificity, 31.5%; P < .001), and NLR.
Conclusions: ML shows a better performance in predicting lymph node metastasis of early-stage OTSCC than conventional prediction methods of DOI, NLR, or tumor budding.

Other investigations of angle fracture risk have exclusively studied patients with existing fractures. In addition, the risk has not been comprehensively explained in conjunction with the specific features of mandibular anatomy. We sought to characterize any anatomic variations between the jaws that had fractured and those that had never fractured.
Materials and Methods: Healthy mandibles with no history of fracture were physically measured at the William M. Bass Skeletal Collection at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and compared with fractured mandibles from computed tomography (CT) scans at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. A total of 52 healthy mandibles and 44 CT scans were evaluated. MATLAB machine learning algorithms (MathWorks, Natick, MA) were used to compare the study populations and isolate those anatomic features that differed between healthy and fractured mandibles.
Results: Machine learning classifiers were able to differentiate between male and female jaws, with the condylion-gnathion distance the most distinguishing feature. The 6 most common anatomic features that differed between healthy and fractured mandibles were the 1) retromolar space, 2) perimeter of the crosssection just proximal to the second molar, 3) breadth of the ramal cross-section, 4) thickness of the oblique ridge, 5) transgonial angle, and 6) location of the ipsilateral mental foramen. The presence of third molars was also related to fracture risk, with third molars present in 72.7% of the fractured mandibles versus 26.9% of unfractured mandibles. Of the fractured mandibles with third molars present, 87.5% had the fracture running directly through the tooth or its socket.
Conclusions: The results from the present study have provided evidence that anatomic differences exist between mandibles that sustain angle fractures and those that do not. Although much of the morphology was found to be interdependent, the fracture risk could be accurately predicted using 6 anatomic features. Understanding these mandibular variations and identifying patients vulnerable to mandibular fracture could provide clinicians with additional objective information. Furthermore, using the methods demonstrated in our study, future research could focus on developing an algorithm that includes these unique anatomic features in the hope of assisting surgeons in providing tailored treatment for mandibular angle fractures according to patient-specific morphology.

The latest (but certainly not final) advancement of smart digital applications - is to be identified the creation of a field, at once conceptual and material, of things denominated smart objects (henceforth SOs). This technological evolution is so pervasive that it is referred to as smartification. Smart objects have some distinctive features including in particular varying degrees of agency, autonomy and authority. There is no doubt that the SO category is extremely broad, various and intrinsically fuzzy, it is evident that the phenomenon is by no means easy to define: which objects are really smart and which are not? But above all: what do we mean in semiolinguistic, and not psychological nor merely phenomenological terms, when we attribute the qualifier smart to an artifact? What is clear is that a new, or at least different (and controversial) relationship is developing between objects and subjects, or rather between human beings and objects inhabiting the spaces of social action: that is, a new system of objects, to cite Baudrillard (1968), or a new ""society of objects"" (see Landowski and Marrone 2002). In this paper we will focus on a type of smart physical device designed to interact with its users in the domestic sphere, assisting them in a variety of tasks - such as for example Amazon Echo, capable of connecting to Alexa, an intelligent personal assistant based on machine learning, or the more recent Google Assistant. Our semiotic-oriented - or, more precisely, potentially socio-semiotic/ethno-semiotic - analysis will deal with these issues theoretically by concentrating on the problem of identity, which is anthropologically, but also and above all philosophically, sensitive. We shall look at the impact of technological devices on the perceptive/cognitive systems of human beings, starting with a reflection on the practices of interaction, signification and interpretation that also involve digital objects with a possible impact on everyday life.","smart objects,forms of life,intentionality,agentivity,assemblage",Article,"WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH, GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,Social Sciences - Other Topics",,0.34,"INTERNET,THINGS",SEMIOTICA,,

Fatigue damage data of aluminium and ABS under coupled mechanical loads at different temperatures are used to train the model. The model shows that natural frequency and temperature appear to be the most important predictive features for aluminium. It appears to be dominated by natural frequency and tip amplitude for ABS.

These methods typically model the mapping from latent space to image with single or multiple generators. However, they have obvious drawbacks: (i) ignoring the multi-modal structure of images, and (ii) lacking model interpretability. Importantly, the existing methods mostly assume one or more generators can cover all image modes even if we do not know the structure of data. Thus, mode dropping and collapse often take place along with GANs training. Despite the importance of exploring the data structure in generation, it has been almost unexplored. In this work, aiming at generating multi-modal images and interpreting model explicitly, we explore the theory on how to integrate GANs with data structure prior, and propose latent Dirichlet allocation based generative adversarial networks (LDAGAN). This framework is extended to combine with a variety of state-of-the-art single-generator GANs and achieves improved performance.

A three-dimensional integral-type nonlocal damage model through finite element method (FEM) has been adopted. For the purpose of investigating the probabilistic damage analysis problems, a freshly established machine learning approach, namely the capped-extended-support vector regression method (C-X-SVR), is proposed to eliminate the influences of random outliers in the first step, then establish the relationship between the uncertain systemic inputs and structural responses. Such that the training robustness and computational adaptability of the proposed regression model can be reinforced. Moreover, the proposed approach is competent of efficiently predicting the statistical information (i.e., means, standard deviations, probability density functions and cumulative density functions) of structural behaviours under continuous information update of the uncertain working condition from mercurial environment.

The ability to rapidly compute the macroscopic behavior based on these detailed microstructures is of paramount importance for accelerating material discovery and design. Here, our focus is on the macroscopic, nonlinear elastic response of materials harboring microstructure. Because of the diversity of microstructural patterns that can form, there is interest in taking a purely computational approach to predicting their macroscopic response. However, the evaluation of macroscopic, nonlinear elastic properties purely based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) is computationally very expensive, and hence impractical for material design when a large number of microstructures need to be tested. A further complexity of a hierarchical nature arises if the elastic free energy and its variation with strain is a small-scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total free energy driven by microstructural dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a data driven approach, which combines advanced neural network (NN) models with DNS to predict the homogenized, macroscopic, mechanical free energy and stress fields arising in a family of multi-component crystalline solids that develop microstructure. The microstructures are numerically generated by solving a coupled, mechanochemical spinodal decomposition problem governed by nonlinear strain gradient elasticity and the Cahn-Hilliard phase field equation. The hierarchical structure of the free energy's evolution induces a multi-resolution character to the machine learning paradigm: We construct knowledge-based neural networks (KBNNs) with either pre-trained fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs), or pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that describe the dominant characteristic of the data to fully represent the hierarchically evolving free energy. We demonstrate multi-resolution learning of the materials physics; specifically of the nonlinear elastic response for both fixed and evolving microstructures. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Materials Methods: Ninety-nine COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study. All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on admission. In addition, follow-up clinical data including the disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, nonlesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume - lesion volume), and fraction of nonlesion lung volume (%NLLV) (nonlesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and NLLV, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built random forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error.
Results: Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (n = 25), severe (n = 47) and critical (n = 27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe, and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, and 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, and 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (n = 3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (n = 80), prolonged recovery (n = 15), and death (n = 1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.18 +/- 9.89%, 82.94 +/- 16.49%, and 66.19 +/- 24.15% with p value <0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers using hybrid models were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severe + critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than either radiomics models or clinical models (p < 0.05). The root-mean-square errors of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60 +/- 1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44 +/- 1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59 +/- 0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32 +/- 0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively.

Our objective was to investigate the effects of combined assessment of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) imaging features and CT-FFR on detecting lesion-specific ischemia by comparing with invasive FFR.
Materials and Methods: Forty-seven patients who had 60 coronary vessels with 30%-90% stenosis were included. Six anatomic CCTA descriptors (Agatston score, stenosis severity, mean plaque CT attenuation value, noncalcified and calcified plaque volumes, remodeling index) and a functional descriptor (CT-FFR) were measured. Random forest was used to identify which descriptors were useful to identify ischemia-related lesion. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for 2 models: i.e. Model-1 for anatomical CT descriptors and Model-2 for anatomical CT descriptors plus CT-FFR.
Results: Stenosis severity (40.8 +/- 15.7% vs 57.6 +/- 14.1%), noncalcified plaque volume (190 +/- 100 vs 254.8 +/- 133.3), and remodeling index (1.04 +/- 0.12 vs 1.11 +/- 0.13) were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions than nonischemia-related lesions. CT-FFR was 0.84 +/- 0.14 and 0.71 +/- 0.14, respectively, for ischemia-related and nonischemia-related lesions, and the difference was significant. The area under the ROC curve was 0.738 and 0.835 in Model-1 and Model-2, respectively. Reclassification of ischemic lesion risk was significantly improved after adding CT-FFR: net reclassification improvement was 0.297 and integrated discrimination improvement was 0.254.

While prosthetic hands with independently actuated digits have become commercially available, state-of-the-art human-machine interfaces (HMI) only permit control over a limited set of grasp patterns, which does not enable amputees to experience sufficient improvement in their daily activities to make an active prosthesis useful. Approach. Here we present a technology platform combining fully-integrated bioelectronics, implantable intrafascicular microelectrodes and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate this missing bridge by tapping into the intricate motor control signals of peripheral nerves. The bioelectric neural interface includes an ultra-low-noise neural recording system to sense electroneurography (ENG) signals from microelectrode arrays implanted in the residual nerves, and AI models employing the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to decode the subject's motor intention. Main results. A pilot human study has been carried out on a transradial amputee. We demonstrate that the information channel established by the proposed neural interface is sufficient to provide high accuracy control of a prosthetic hand up to 15 degrees of freedom (DOF). The interface is intuitive as it directly maps complex prosthesis movements to the patient's true intention. Significance. Our study layouts the foundation towards not only a robust and dexterous control strategy for modern neuroprostheses at a near-natural level approaching that of the able hand, but also an intuitive conduit for connecting human minds and machines through the peripheral neural pathways.

Poorly managing surgical wounds may cause many serious complications. Thus, it raises the necessity to develop a patient-friendly self-care system which can help both patients and medical professionals to ensure the state of the surgical wounds without any special medical equipment. In this paper, a surgical wound assessment system for self-care is proposed. The proposed system is designed to enable patients capture surgical wound images of themselves by using a mobile device and upload these images for analysis. Combining image-processing and machine-learning techniques, the proposed method is composed of four phases. First, images are segmented into superpixels where each superpixel contains the pixels in the similar color distribution. Second, these superpixels corresponding to the skin are identified and the area of connected skin superpixels is derived. Third, surgical wounds will be extracted from this area based on the observation of the texture difference between skin and wounds. Lastly, state and symptoms of surgical wound will be assessed. Extensive experimental results are conducted. With the proposed method, more than 90% state assessment results are correct and more than 91% symptom assessment results consistent with the actual diagnosis. Moreover, case studies are provided to show the advantage and limitation of this system. These results show that this system could perform well in the practical self-care scenario.","Wounds,Surgery,Skin,Feature extraction,Image color analysis,Biomedical monitoring,Cameras,Artificial intelligence (AI),classification,health care service systems",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,10.969,"LOGISTIC-REGRESSION,SKIN,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6221021/9261964/08463573.pdf,

Left ventricular end-systolic elastance (E-es) measures the left ventricular contractile function, but its estimation requires the occlusion of the left atrium line in the ESHP, which may cause unnecessary damage to the donor heart. We present a novel method to quantify E-es based on hemodynamic parameters obtained from only one steady-state PV loop in ESHP. Methods: E-es was obtained by the end-systolic point (P-es, V-es) and the volume axis intercept point of E-es (V-0). V-0 was estimated through the support vector machine regression (SVR) method using parameters derived from the measured steady-state PV loop. To achieve high V-0 estimation accuracy, a filter-based support vector machine recursive feature elimination method (SVM-RFE) algorithm selected the parameters for V-0 estimation. Hemodynamic parameter samples (n = 101) obtained from ESHP experiments with pig's hearts were used to train the E-es calculation model. Early post-transplantation outcomes in six heart transplantation experiments were then estimated from the trained E-es calculation model. Results: E-es calculated by the proposed method agreed well with conventional multi-beat estimates obtained by the occlusion process (r = 0.88, p < 0.001, n = 101) and was capable of predicting the early post-transplant cardiac index (r = 0.84, p < 0.05, n = 6). Conclusion: This method effectively assesses left ventricular contractility during ESHP and predicts early post-transplant outcomes in the porcine model. Significance: Our approach is the first to quantify E-es by estimating V-0 from steady-state beats in ESHP for accurately predicting early post-transplantation outcomes.","Ex situ heart perfusion,left ventricular contractility,machine learning,heart transplantation",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"PRESSURE-VOLUME,RELATIONSHIP,END-SYSTOLIC,ELASTANCE,VIVO,PERFUSION,DONOR,HEARTS,TRANSPLANTATION,PERFORMANCE,AFTERLOAD,ISCHEMIA,SLOPE",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,,

Methods: we use the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the Skin Potential Response (SPR) signal, which has several advantages with respect to other Electrodermal (EDA) signals. We record one SPR signal for each hand, and use an algorithm that, selecting the smoother signal, is able to remove motion artifacts. We extract statistical features from the ECG and SPR signals in order to classify signal segments and identify the presence or absence of emotional events via a Supervised Learning Algorithm.

This deformation is viscoelastic and differs from a traditional rigid transformation. In this paper, we describe a machine learning enabled wireless sensing system that predicts the trajectory of intracranial brain deformation. The sensing system consists of an implantable soft magnet and an external magnetic sensor array with a sensing volume of 12 x 12 x 4 mm(3). Machine learning algorithm predicts the brain deformation by interpreting the magnetic sensor outputs created by the change in position of the implanted soft magnet. Three different machine learning models were trained on calibration data: (1) random forests, (2) k-nearest neighbors, and (3) a multi-layer perceptron-based neural network. These models were validated using both in vitro (a needle inserted into PVC gel) and in vivo (blast exposure to live and dead rat brains) experiments. The in vitro gel deformation predicted by these machine learning models showed excellent agreement with the camera measurements and had absolute error = 138 mu m, Frechet distance = 372 mu m with normalized Procrustes disparity = 0.034. The in vivo brain deformation predicted by these models had absolute error = 50 mu m, Frechet distance = 95 mu m with normalized Procrustes disparity = 0.055 for dead animal and absolute error = 125 mu m, Frechet distance = 289 mu m with normalized Procrustes disparity = 0.2 for live animal respectively.

Emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a vital role in the development of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Extracting the important information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its nonstationary nature. Fixing a factual predefined basis function for efficient decomposition using a tunable Q wavelet transform is an arduous task. In this article, an adaptive tunable Q wavelet transform is proposed for the automatic selection of tuning parameters. Optimum tuning parameters are obtained using gray wolf optimization (GWO). Tuning parameters obtained by GWO are used to decompose the EEG signals into subbands (SBs). The set of time-domain features elicited from the SBs are used as an input to multiclass least-squares support vector machine. Classification accuracy of four basic emotions, namely, happy, fear, sad, and relax, is tested and compared with existing methods. An accuracy of 95.70% is achieved with a radial basis function kernel that is about 5% more than the existing methods using the same data set. This article proposes the development of a nonparameterized decomposition method for efficient decomposition of EEG signals.

General circulation models require high resolution observational data in order to be properly initialized, but these data do not exist for the ocean. Statistical models are difficult to tune with existing data and are often too simple to accurately encapsulate turbulent flows. Here we investigate a data-driven approach to ocean transport prediction wherein the goal is to first learn from available data instead of prescribed laws of physics and then apply this information to new data. More specifically, we explore whether simple artificial neural networks (ANNs) are capable of learning to predict 2D particle trajectories using only previous velocity observations. ANNs are trained in two ways: first, a so-called ""one-to-one ANN""uses a particle's most recently observed velocity to predict its velocity six hours later, and second, a ""time series ANN""uses the past 24 hours' worth of velocity observations to predict the next 24 h. We present a proof of-concept considering particles in a hierarchy of simulated flow regimes ranging from uniform, steady flow to more complex scenarios with interacting scales of motion and then substantiate our approach on trajectories in modeled flows generated by a high-resolution Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model for a mesoscale eddy in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We also assess ANN sensitivity to the prediction window over which forecasts are made, the number of training particles used, and the size of the network. ANNs successfully predict 24 h trajectories within the temporal bounds of the training data with forecast errors around half those of both rudimentary persistence and classical ARIMA models. Predicting beyond the domain of the training data leads to forecast errors comparable to ARIMA models. Our results suggest that ANNs offer promising potential as a data-driven approach to forecasting material transport in the ocean.","Advection,Current velocity,Mass transport,Particle motion,Current prediction,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Oceanography",,3.844,"MIXED-LAYER,INSTABILITIES,HIGH-FREQUENCY,RADAR,GENERAL,CIRCULATION,DATA,ASSIMILATION,MESOSCALE,EDDIES,NORTHERN,GULF,SURFACE,PREDICTABILITY,DISPERSION,TRANSPORT",OCEAN MODELLING,,

Yielding high prediction accuracies of 99.82% and 98.68% for a correct classification of impact location and energy, respectively, the capability of the proposed approach was demonstrated. Despite their limited resolution the low-cost MEMS accelerometers were able to correctly locate an impact and its energy with 99.76% and 97.04%, respectively. The pretraining led to an increased robustness of the training process. Additionally, for the case of PZT sensors, it also reduced the number of required epochs for convergence significantly.","structural health monitoring,impact detection,fiber-reinforced composites,microelectromechanical system,piezoelectric transducer,convolutional neural network,artificial intelligence",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Instruments & Instrumentation,Materials Science",,3.893,"PIEZOELECTRIC,STRAIN,SENSORS,IDENTIFYING,IMPACTS,NEURAL-NETWORK,LOCALIZATION",SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES,,

The response of desmoid tumors (DTs) to chemotherapy is evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in daily practice and clinical trials. MRI shows early change in heterogeneity in responding tumors due to a decrease in cellular area and an increase in fibronecrotic content before dimensional response. Heterogeneity can be quantified with radiomics. Our aim was to develop radiomics-based response criteria and to compare their performances with clinical and radiologic response criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty-two patients (median age, 38.2 years) were included in this retrospective multicenter study because they presented with progressive DT and had an MRI examination at baseline, which we refer to as ""MRI-0,"" and an early MRI evaluation performed after the first chemotherapy cycle (mean time after first chemotherapy cycle, 3 months [SD, 28 days]), which we refer to as ""MRI-1."" After signal intensity normalization, voxel size standardization, discretization, and segmentation of DT volume on fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, 90 baseline and delta 3D radiomics features were extracted. Using cross-validation and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized Cox regression, a radiomics score was generated. The performances of models based on the radiomics score, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, Cheson criteria, Choi criteria, and revised Choi criteria from MRI-0 to MRI-1 to predict progression-free survival (PFS, as defined by RECIST 1.1) were assessed with the concordance index. The results were adjusted for performance status, tumor volume, prior chemotherapy, current chemotherapy, and beta-catenin mutation.
RESULTS. There were 10 cases of progression. The radiomics score included four variables. A high score indicated a poor prognosis. The radiomics score independently correlated with PFS (adjusted hazard ratio = 5.60, p = 0.003), and none of the usual response criteria independently correlated with PFS. The prognostic model based on the radiomics score had the highest concordance index (0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96).
CONCLUSION. Quantifying early changes in heterogeneity through a dedicated radiomics score could improve response evaluation for patients with DT undergoing chemotherapy.","aggressive,antineoplastic agents,fibromatosis,MRI,Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)",Article,"AMER ROENTGEN RAY SOC, 44211 SLATESTONE CT, LEESBURG, VA USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.073,"COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,FIBROMATOSIS,SORAFENIB,MODELS,RECIST",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,,

In contrast to existing data-driven models, which are trained for a specific garment or mesh topology, our fully convolutional model can cope with a large family of garments, represented as parametric predefined 2D panels with arbitrary mesh topology, including long dresses, shirts, and tight tops. Under the hood, our novel geometric deep learning approach learns to drape 3D garments by decoupling the three different sources of deformations that condition the fit of clothing: garment type, target body shape, and material. Specifically, we first learn a regressor that predicts the 3D drape of the input parametric garment when worn by a mean body shape. Then, after a mesh topology optimization step where we generate a sufficient level of detail for the input garment type, we further deform the mesh to reproduce deformations caused by the target body shape. Finally, we predict fine-scale details such as wrinkles that depend mostly on the garment material. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our fully convolutional approach outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization capabilities and memory requirements, and therefore it opens the door to more general learning-based models for virtual try-on applications.","CCS Concepts,&#8226,Computing methodologies &#8594,Animation,Machine learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Computer Science,,2.459,"DYNAMICS,CAPTURE",COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04592,

Many current SR models, however, have heavy demands on computation and memory, which are not friendly to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where computing resource is usually constrained. On the other hand, a basic consideration in most MRI experiments is how to reduce scanning time to improve patient comfort and reduce motion artifacts. In this work, we ease the problem by presenting an effective and lightweight model that supports fast training and accurate SR inference. The proposed network is inspired by the lateral inhibition mechanism, which assumes that there exist inhibitory effects between adjacent neurons. The backbone of our network consists of several lateral inhibition blocks, where the inhibitory effect is explicitly implemented by a battery of cascaded local inhibition units. When model scale is small, explicitly inhibiting feature activations is expected to further explore model representational capacity. For more effective feature extraction, several parallel dilated convolutions are also used to extract shallow features directly from the input image. Extensive experiments on typical MR images demonstrate that our lateral inhibition network (LIN) achieves better SR performance than other lightweight models with similar model scale.","Convolutional neural network,Deep learning,Lateral inhibition,Magnetic resonance imaging,Super-resolution",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE, 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,3.532,"TAKE-ALL,COMPETITION",COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING,,

Statistical analysis of design behavior duration shows that participants with more than 3 years of industry experience spend significantly less time removing material and revising than those with less experience. Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) analysis of the design behaviors gives insight to the transitions between behaviors through which designers proceed. Findings show that high-performing designers proceeded through four behavioral states, smoothly transitioning between states. In contrast, low-performing designers roughly transitioned between states, with moderate transition probabilities back and forth between multiple states.","design process,design visualization,machine learning",Article,"ASME, TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",Engineering,,3.602,,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,,

Furthermore, catalysts often have multiple active sites preventing one from obtaining insights into structure-property relations. Here, we develop a data-driven quantitative synthesis-structure-property relation (QS(2)PRs) methodology to elucidate correlations between catalyst synthesis conditions, structural properties and observed performance and to provide fundamental insights into active sites and a systematic way to optimize practical catalysts. We demonstrate the approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped catalysts (NDCs) made via pyrolysis for the performance of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), quantified by the onset potential and the current density. We determine crystallinity, nitrogen species type and fraction, surface area, and pore structure of the NDCs using XRD, XPS, and BET characterization. We demonstrated that an active learning-based optimization combined with various elementary machine learning tools (regression, principal component analysis, partial least squares) can efficiently identify optimum pyrolysis conditions to tune structural characteristics and performance with concomitant savings in materials and experimental time. Unlike previous reports on the importance of pyridinic or graphitic nitrogen, we discover that the electrochemical performance is not driven by a single catalyst property; rather, it arises from a multivariate influence of nitrogen dopants, pore structure and disorder in the NDC materials. Identification of active sites can help mechanistic understanding and further catalyst improvement.","GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION,GROUP ADDITIVITY,UNIFAC MODEL,PREDICTION,CATALYSTS,GRAPHENE,DESIGN,ADSORPTION,SIMULATION,NANOSHEETS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Engineering",,4.502,"GLOBAL,OPTIMIZATION,GROUP,ADDITIVITY,UNIFAC,MODEL,PREDICTION,CATALYSTS,GRAPHENE,DESIGN,ADSORPTION,SIMULATION,NANOSHEETS",REACTION CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1657667,

In the absence of effective treatments, the main containment strategy is to reduce the contagion by the isolation of infected individuals; however, isolation of unaffected individuals is highly undesirable. To help make rapid decisions on treatment and isolation needs, it would be useful to determine which features presented by suspected infection cases are the best predictors of a positive diagnosis. This can be done by analyzing patient characteristics, case trajectory, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes. We developed a model that employed supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the presentation features predicting COVID-19 disease diagnoses with high accuracy. Features examined included details of the individuals concerned, e.g., age, gender, observation of fever, history of travel, and clinical details such as the severity of cough and incidence of lung infection. We implemented and applied several machine learning algorithms to our collected data and found that the XGBoost algorithm performed with the highest accuracy (>85%) to predict and select features that correctly indicate COVID-19 status for all age groups. Statistical analyses revealed that the most frequent and significant predictive symptoms are fever (41.1%), cough (30.3%), lung infection (13.1%) and runny nose (8.43%). While 54.4% of people examined did not develop any symptoms that could be used for diagnosis, our work indicates that for the remainder, our predictive model could significantly improve the prediction of COVID-19 status, including at early stages of infection.

It is an alternative to high-complexity and time-consuming standard approaches, which are based on the numerical solution of sets of nonlinear differential equations. Main relevance resides on its possible application in real-time network controllers for future multi-band optical line systems where Raman amplification will be required to copewith capacities beyond the standard C-band. Here we consider as an example the C+L-band scenario with different input load conditions: full load and partial loads. For the case of full load it has been recently shown a neural network (NN) capable of highly accurate predictions. Real optical networks are not usually operated only in full load conditions: the load can dynamically vary over time and the behavior of the Raman amplifier depends on it. In this article we introduce a new NNmodel and we show its higher accuracy when the line system is not fully loaded: we define it as the load aware neural network. Applying this new approachwe can predict both gain and ASE noise profiles in Raman amplifiers with high accuracy under any load conditions: we demonstrate almost 100% of maximum prediction errors to be lower than 0.5 dB.","Optical communication,optical amplifiers,machine learning,neural networks",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Optics,Telecommunications",,3.764,MACHINE,JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY,https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/234702100/hkkr_09160884.pdf,

The predict model starts from a benchmark dataset generated by large-scale molecular dynamics computations. In predict models, the polymers were 'fingerprinted' as simple, easily attainable numerical representations, which helps to develop an on-demand property prediction model.

The outcome of this analysis is a computational-based ML framework that is capable of identifying failure mode of UHPC beams and simplified expressions for predicting shear capacity of UHPC beams. Predictions obtained from the proposed framework was compared against the values obtained from design equations in codes, and also results from full-scale tests to show the reliability of the proposed approach.

The aim of this study was to develop a risk score, using patient characteristics, that could differentiate between populations with higher and lower 2-year risk of severe hypoglycaemia among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Materials and methods Two models were developed for the risk score based on data from the DEVOTE cardiovascular outcomes trials. The first, a data-driven machine-learning model, used stepwise regression with bidirectional elimination to identify risk factors for severe hypoglycaemia. The second, a risk score based on known clinical risk factors accessible in clinical practice identified from the data-driven model, included: insulin treatment regimen; diabetes duration; sex; age; and glycated haemoglobin, all at baseline. Both the data-driven model and simple risk score were evaluated for discrimination, calibration and generalizability using data from DEVOTE, and were validated against the external LEADER cardiovascular outcomes trial dataset.
Results Both the data-driven model and the simple risk score discriminated between patients at higher and lower hypoglycaemia risk, and performed similarly well based on the time-dependent area under the curve index (0.63 and 0.66, respectively) over a 2-year time horizon.
Conclusions Both the data-driven model and the simple hypoglycaemia risk score were able to discriminate between patients at higher and lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia, the latter doing so using easily accessible clinical data.

The objectives of this study are to design and implement a Cell Merger Approach to improve the efficiency and realism of the PAP-smears classification model, by allowing overlapping and folding of different cells, to design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network for PAP-smears image classification, and to optimize and integrate the cell fusion approach with the neural network building a feasible, reliable and highly accurate system for cervical smears classification. The carried out experiments have validated both the CNN and the proposed Cell Merger Approach with very interesting results. The most outstanding results show that the Convolutional Neural Network models together with the Cell Merger Approach have a classification accuracy of 88.8% with a standard deviation of 1%, obtaining a sensitivity and specificity of 0.92 and 0.83 respectively.

Since these methods do not include a training phase, they require less time to apply and are more practical to use. Traditional unsupervised classification methods work with parameters given by the user, such as the number of classes, the stop criterion or the number of iterations of the algorithm. Determining the optimum values of these parameters to obtain successful classification result is a major problem.
In this study, we propose two new methods, the weighted density based optimized classification method (DBOC-Weighted) and the automatic density based optimized classification method (DBOCAutomatic). Both work automatically without the need for parameters from the user, but the DBOCWeighted only requires layer weights. These methods consist of data range expansion, useful data selection, segmentation and optimization stages, and perform the classification automatically. Both create new layers of data using remotely sensed images. After creating the initial classes based on density from all the data layers, the results are created by optimizing all classes in terms of quality indices.
Four Sentinel 2 images are used to test the performance of the proposed methods. These images are selected from regions that have different geographical, climatic and vegetation properties. The results obtained are compared with the unsupervised classification methods frequently used in the literature. The accuracy analysis results show that the proposed classification algorithms produce satisfactory accuracy compared to the results of other algorithms. The results show that the proposed methods can be used successfully in the creation of expert and intelligent analysis systems, by eliminating user induced error in the analysis of remotely sensed images. Thus, smart analysis tools can be created so that users from various professional disciplines can easily use them without being image processing specialists. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was implemented and used to segment mu CT images of two different types of reinforcement (2D glass and 3D carbon). The DCNN successfully segmented the images based on multi-scale features extracted using data-driven convolutional filters. The network was trained using scanned mu CT images, along with images extracted from computer-generated virtual models of the reinforcements. One of the convolutional layers of the trained network was utilized to extract features to be used in creating a machine learning-based model. The extracted features and the raw gray-scale data were used to train a supervised k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model for pixel-wise classification. The performance of both approaches was evaluated by comparing the results with manually segmented images. The trained deep neural network was able to provide faster and superior predictions of different features of the reinforcements as compared to the conventional machine learning approach.","Fabrics/textiles,CT analysis,Process modeling,Microstructures",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,8.012,"FE,ANALYSES",COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING,,

The developed machine learning potential is validated by comparing partial radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and partial structure factors with AIMD and PIM potential.

However, the actual production data may encounter various outliers due to noise, sensor failure, and operator negligence existing in this process. To tackle this issue, this article develops an original framework for the detection and correction of abnormal production data in the sintering process. First, an improved kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is developed to effectively divide normal production data under multiple operating conditions. Then, different one-class support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are constructed for different operating conditions. According to which operating condition the actual production data belongs to, the one-class SVM under this operating condition is called to accurately detect abnormal production data. Finally, the most similar normal historical data in the operating condition is obtained to correct the abnormal data by using k nearest neighbor algorithm based on the Mahalanobis distance. Simulation results involving actual production data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. By taking two existing models of the sintering process as examples, their prediction performance becomes improved after detecting and correcting the abnormal production data, so that the proposed framework has important engineering application impact.","Support vector machines,Anomaly detection,Informatics,Data models,Predictive models,Bellows,Abnormal data detection,actual production data,iron ore sintering process,kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM),multiple operating conditions,one-class support vector machine",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering",,9.768,"CARBON,EFFICIENCY,ALGORITHM,SYSTEM,MODEL",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS,,

This study leveraged on the power of ensemble machine learning by combining the performances of different models in estimating the corrosion initiation time of steel embedded in self compacted concrete using corrosion potential measurement. The concrete specimens were prepared with limestone powder as supplementary addition to Portland cement and was exposed to 5% sodium chloride in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C876 - 15 for 8 months. During the exposure, corrosion potential of the embedded steel was measured, and the recorded datasets were used in training five different machine learning models. With cement, limestone powder, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water and exposure period.as input variables, five different models were developed to estimate the corrosion initiation time (determined from the corrosion potential measurements) of the embedded steel. With respect to model predictive performance, the acquired results demonstrated that the random forest (RF) ensemble model amongst other trained models performed best with 85/15 dataset percentage split for the training and testing. RF ensemble performed best with CC and RMSE of 99.01% and 18.2747 mV for training, and 98.67% and 25.0298 mV for testing respectively.

Traditionally, in an industrial application, conventional methods are inefficient when the detection targets are small, local, and subtle in the complex scenario.

To overcome these challenges, an efficient CNN model, only trained with image-level labels, is first proposed for detection of tiny casting defects in a complicated industrial scene. Then, in this article, we present a novel training strategy which can form a new object-level attention mechanism for the model during the training phase, and bilinear pooling is utilized to improve the model capability of detecting local contrast casting defects. Moreover, to enhance the interpretability, we extend class activation maps (CAM) to bilinear CAM (Bi-CAM) which is adapted to bilinear architectures as a visualization technique to reason about the model output.

In this work, we studied segregation of W into ZrB2 grain boundaries by a hybrid method combining Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD), and examined the effects of segregation on grain boundary strengths by MD tensile testing with a fitted machine learning potential. It is found that W prefers grain boundary sites with local compression strains due to its smaller size compared to Zr. Rich segregation patterns (including monolayer, off-center bilayer, and other complex patterns); segregation induced grain boundary structure reconstruction; and order-disorder like segregation pattern transformation are discovered.

Methods In this retrospective study, we enrolled 192 patients diagnosed with CRLM who received first-line chemotherapy and were followed by response assessment. Tumor response was identified according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images were fed as inputs of the ResNet10-based DL radiomics model, and the possibility of response was predicted as the output. The final combined DL radiomics model was constructed by integrating the response-related clinical factors and the developed DL radiomics signature. A time-independent validation cohort (n = 48) was extracted from the 192 patients to evaluate the DL model with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity. Meanwhile, a traditional radiomics model was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) as comparisons with the DL-based model.
Results According to RECIST criteria, 131 patients were identified as responders with complete response, partial response, and stable disease, while 61 patients were nonresponders with progression disease. The selected predictive clinical factor turned out to be the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level with AUC of 0.489 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.380-0.599) and 0.558 (95% CI, 0.374-0.741) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The DL-based model provided better performance than the traditional classifier-based radiomics model with significantly higher AUC (training: 0.903 [95% CI, 0.851-0.955] vs 0.745 [95% CI, 0.659-0.831]; validation: 0.820 [95% CI, 0.681-0.959] vs 0.598 [95% CI, 0.422-0.774]). The combination of DL-based model with the CEA level provided slightly increased performance with AUC of 0.935 [95% CI, 0.897-0.973] in the training cohort and 0.830 [95% CI, 0.688-0.973] in the validation cohort.
Conclusions The developed DL-based radiomics model could improve the efficiency to predict the response to chemotherapy in CRLM, which may assist in subsequent personalized treatment decision-making in CRLM management.","colorectal liver metastases,chemotherapy,radiomics,contrast&#8208,enhanced multidetector computed tomography,deep learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"HEPATIC,METASTASIS,CANCER,CT,ENHANCEMENT,BEVACIZUMAB,CARCINOMA,FEATURES,CRITERIA,FOLFOX",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Currently, the ultrasonic wave method is widely used for this purpose, which overestimates the static mechanical properties of wood. To resolve this challenge, this paper proposes a robust machine learning-based model for predicting the modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of wood with varying moisture content (MC) using the guided Lamb wave propagation method. It combines the Lamb wave velocity with the ""group method of data handling"" to predict the mechanical properties of wood. The effect of MC and density on the Lamb wave velocity and the mechanical properties of seventy green poplar wood specimens were analyzed and discussed. It was shown that the Lamb wave velocity is highly sensitive to the MC, density, and mechanical properties of wood. It enables the guided Lamb wave propagation to be used as a reliable method for nondestructive timber characterization. The MOE and MOR of wood specimens predicted by the developed machine learning model were compared with those from the three-point bending tests, and the obtained accuracy was revealed to be higher than that obtained in the literature using the conventional ultrasonic method. It was concluded that the proposed combined Lamb wave propagation and machine learning method offers a strong tool for nondestructive prediction of the mechanical properties of wood.

However, rheological characterizations are under-utilized in 3D printing of drug formulations. In this study, viscosity measurements were used to establish a mathematical model for predicting the printability of fused deposition modelling 3D printed tablets (Printlets). The formulations were composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different amounts of ciprofloxacin and polyethylene glycol (PEG), and different molecular weights of PEG. With all printing parameters kept constant, both binary and ternary blends were found to extrude at nozzle temperatures of 130, 150 and 170 degrees C. In contrast PCL was unextrudable at 130 and 150 degrees C. Three standard rheological models were applied to the experimental viscosity measurements, which revealed an operating viscosity window of between 100 and 1000 Pa.s at the apparent shear rate of the nozzle. The drug release profiles of the printlets were experimentally measured over seven days. As a proof-of-concept, machine learning models were developed to predict the dissolution behaviour from the viscosity measurements. The machine learning models were discovered to accurately predict the dissolution profile, with the highest f(2) similarity score value of 90.9 recorded. Therefore, the study demonstrated that using only the viscosity measurements can be employed for the simultaneous high-throughput screening of formulations that are printable and with the desired release profile.","Three-dimensional printing,3D Printed drug products,Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM),Oral drug delivery systems,Artificial intelligence,Personalized pharmaceuticals and medicines,Prediction models",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,5.423,"RELEASE,DELIVERY,DEPOSITION,POLYMERS,CIPROFLOXACIN,TEMPERATURE,FABRICATION,IMMEDIATE,BEHAVIOR,FILMS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10111904/3/Basit_Manuscript_revised.pdf,

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional printing (3DP) has made significant advancements in the field of oral drug delivery with personalized drug-loaded formulations being designed, developed and dispensed for the needs of the patient. The FDM 3DP process begins with the production of drug-loaded filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME), followed by the printing of a drug product using a FDM 3D printer. However, the optimization of the fabrication parameters is a time-consuming, empirical trial approach, requiring expert knowledge. Here, M3DISEEN, a web-based pharmaceutical software, was developed to accelerate FDM 3D printing using AI machine learning techniques (MLTs). In total, 614 drug-loaded formulations were designed from a comprehensive list of 145 different pharmaceutical excipients, 3D printed and assessed in-house. To build the predictive tool, a dataset was constructed and models were trained and tested at a ratio of 75:25. Significantly, the AI models predicted key fabrication parameters with accuracies of 76% and 67% for the printability and the filament characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the AI models predicted the HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 8.9 degrees C and 8.3 degrees C, respectively. Strikingly, the AI models achieved high levels of accuracy by solely inputting the pharmaceutical excipient trade names.

The EDA signals are obtained from the publicly available DEAP database and are decomposed into tonic and phasic components. The phasic component is subjected to the short-time Fourier transform. Thirty-eight features of time, frequency, and time-frequency domain are extracted from the phasic signal. These extracted features are applied to CNN to learn robust and prominent features. Five machine learning algorithms, namely linear discriminant analysis, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, decision tree, and extreme learning machine are used for the classification. The results show that the proposed approach is able to classify the emotional states using arousal-valence dimensions. Classification using CNN learned features are found to be better than the conventional features. The trained end-to-end CNN model is found to be accurate (Fmeasure = 79.30% and 71.41% for arousal and valence dimensions) in classifying various emotional states. The proposed method is found to be robust in handling the dynamic variation of EDA signals for different emotional states. The results show that the proposed approach outperformed most of the state-of-the-art methods. Thus, it appears that the proposed method could be beneficial in analyzing various emotional states in both normal and clinical conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Proper diagnosis depends mainly on tumor staging and grading. Pathological prognosis often faces problems because of the limited availability of tissue samples. Machine learning methods may play a vital role in such cases. 2D or 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been the predominant technology in this domain. Contemporary studies tried to classify NSCLC tumors as benign or malignant. The application of 1D CNN in automated staging and grading of NSCLC is not very frequent. The aim of the present study is to develop a 1 D CNN model for automated staging and grading of NSCLC. The updated NSCLC Radiogenomics Collection from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) was used in the study. The segmented tumor images were fed into a hybrid feature detection and extraction model (MSER-SURF). The extracted features were clubbed with the clinical TNM stage and histopathological grade information and fed into the 1 D CNN model. The performance of the proposed CNN model was satisfactory. The accuracy and ROC-AUC score were higher than the other leading machine learning methods. The study also did well compared to state-of-the-art studies. The proposed model shows that 1D CNN is equally useful in NSCLC prediction like a conventional 2D/3D CNN model. The model may further be refined by carrying out experiments with varied hyper-parameters. Further studies may be conducted by considering semi-supervised or unsupervised learning techniques.

Early diagnosis of PD is important for initial treatment. This paper presents a newly developed method for application in remote tracking of PD progression. The method is based on deep learning and clustering approaches. Specifically, we use the Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The DBN prediction models were developed by different epoch numbers. We use a clustering approach, namely, Self Organizing Map (SOM), to improve the accuracy and scalability of prediction. We evaluate our method on a real-world PD dataset. In all, nine clusters were detected from the data with the best SOM map quality for clustering, and for each cluster, a DBN was developed with a specific number of epochs. The results of the DBN prediction models were integrated by the SVR technique. Further, we compare our work with other supervised learning techniques, SVR and Neuro-Fuzzy techniques. The results revealed that the hybrid of clustering and DBN with the aid of SVR for an ensemble of the DBN outputs can make relatively better predictions of Total-UPDRS and Motor-UPDRS than other learning techniques.

We apply high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, together with a machine learning framework, to identify 2D MXene ordered binary alloy (OBA) activity trends and guide HER catalyst design. 2D MXenes of Mn+1XnO2 (n = 1, 2, 3; X = C, N) and OBA HER catalysts of M2M ' X2O2 and M2M ' 2X3O2 with 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal electrons were enumerated by screening, followed by catalytic activity, thermal stability, and conductivity computations. Our results indicate that 110 kinds of experimentally unexplored 2D MXene OBAs with thermostability and outstanding HER activity surpassing that of noble metal platinum were selected. Especially, the titanium element is mainly contained in the ideal catalysts of 2D MXene OBAs, which is consistent with the MXenes synthesized by experiments.

Based on quantum mechanical calculations, we find that the adsorption energies of alkali metal atoms on 2D TMDCs are strongly and linearly correlated with the energy of the lowest unoccupied states of the materials. This relation is associated with the strong ionization of alkali metal atoms. We propose and demonstrate the E-LUS of TMDCs as a descriptor for predicting adsorption energies. As long as the adsorption is controlled by charge transfer providing a phenomenological model for connecting the electronic details of a material to its interaction with other atomic/molecular species this predictor is expected to be transferable.

Recently, the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) sub-index maps were shown to be able to reveal the error types of the dose distributions. In this study, we aimed to apply radiomics analysis on SSIM sub-index maps and develop ML models to classify delivery errors in patient-specific dynamic IMRT QA.
Methods: Twenty-one sliding-window IMRT plans of 180 beams for three treatment sites were involved in this study. Four types of machine-related errors of various magnitudes were simulated for each beam at each control point, including the monitor unit (MU) variations, same-directional and opposite-directional shifts of the multileaf collimators (MLCs) and random mispositioning of the MLCs. In the QA process, a total of 1620 portal dose (PD) images were acquired for the beams with and without errors. The predicted PD images of the original beams were set as references. To quantify the agreement between a measured PD image and the corresponding predicted PD image, four difference maps including three SSIM sub-index maps, and one dose difference-derived map were calculated. Then, radiomic features were extracted from the four difference maps of each measured PD image. We tested four typical classifiers including linear discriminant classifier (LDC), two supporting vector machine (SVM) classifiers, and random forest (RF) for this multiclass classification task. A nested cross-validation scheme was used for model evaluations, where the SVM recursive feature elimination method was applied for feature selection. Finally, the performance of the ML model on identifying the error-free and the erroneous cases was compared to that of the conventional gamma analysis.
Results: The statistics of the selected features showed that all of the difference maps and the feature categories made balanced contributions to solve this classification task. Best performance was achieved by the Linear-SVM model with average overall classification accuracy of 0.86. Specifically, the average classification accuracies of the shift, opening, and the random errors were around 0.9. Moreover, similar to 80% of error-free and MU errors were correctly classified. Using gamma analysis, the 3 mm/3% criterion was found insensitive to errors (sensitivity was only 0.33). Although the sensitivity to errors with the 2 mm/2% criterion increased to 0.79, still 8% worse than that of the ML model.
Conclusions: We proposed an ML-based method for machine-related error identification in patient-specific dynamic IMRT QA, where radiomic analysis on SSIM sub-index maps were used for feature extraction. With extensive validation to select the best features and classifiers, high accuracies in error classification were achieved. Compared with the conventional gamma threshold method, this approach has great potential in error identification for the patient-specific IMRT QA process.

The purpose of this study was to develop a method to accurately register multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with CBCT images for improved DIL delineation, treatment planning, and dose monitoring in prostate radiotherapy.
Methods and materials We proposed a novel registration framework which considers biomechanical constraint when deforming the MR to CBCT. The registration framework consists of two segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN) for MR and CBCT prostate segmentation, and a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud (PC) matching network. Image intensity-based rigid registration was first performed to initialize the alignment between MR and CBCT prostate. The aligned prostates were then meshed into tetrahedron elements to generate volumetric PC representation of the prostate shapes. The 3D PC matching network was developed to predict a PC motion vector field which can deform the MRI prostate PC to match the CBCT prostate PC. To regularize the network's motion prediction with biomechanical constraints, finite element (FE) modeling-generated motion fields were used to train the network. MRI and CBCT images of 50 patients with intraprostatic fiducial markers were used in this study. Registration results were evaluated using three metrics including dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and target registration error (TRE). In addition to spatial registration accuracy, Jacobian determinant and strain tensors were calculated to assess the physical fidelity of the deformation field.
Results The mean and standard deviation of our method were 0.93 +/- 0.01, 1.66 +/- 0.10 mm, and 2.68 +/- 1.91 mm for DSC, MSD, and TRE, respectively. The mean TRE of the proposed method was reduced by 29.1%, 14.3%, and 11.6% as compared to image intensity-based rigid registration, coherent point drifting (CPD) nonrigid surface registration, and modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND) registration, respectively.
Conclusion We developed a new framework to accurately register the prostate on MRI to CBCT images for external beam radiotherapy.

The contours of liver and liver tumors are currently obtained by manual labeling, which is time-consuming and subjective. Computer-aided segmentation methods have been widely used in the segmentation of liver and liver tumors. However, due to the diversity of shape, volume, and image intensity, the segmentation is still a difficult task. In this study, we present a Spatial Feature Fusion Convolutional Network (SFF-Net) to automatically segment liver and liver tumors from CT images.
Methods First, we extract side-outputs at each convolutional block in SFF-Net to make full use of multiscale features. Second, skip-connections are added in the down-sampling phase, therefore, the spatial information can be efficiently transferred to later layers. Third, we present feature fusion blocks (FFBs) to merge spatial features and high-level semantic features from early layers and later layers, respectively. Finally, a fully connected 3D conditional random fields (CRFs) is applied to refine the liver and liver tumor segmentation results.
Results We test our method on the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge dataset. The Dice Global (DG) score, Dice per case (DC) score, Volume Overlap Error (VOE), Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD), and tumor precision score are calculated to evaluate the liver and liver tumor segmentation accuracies. For the liver segmentation, DG is 0.955; DC is 0.937; VOE is 0.106; and ASSD is 3.678. For the tumor segmentation, DG is 0.746; DC is 0.592; VOE is 0.416; ASSD is 1.585 and the tumor precision score is 0.369.
Conclusions The SFF-Net learns more spatial information by adding skip-connections and feature fusion blocks.

In this study, rigorous paradigms based on two artificial neural network (ANN) types, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and cascaded forward neural network (CFNN), optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm were proposed as machine learning (ML) modeling tools to predict the solubility of sulfur in sour gas mixtures and pure H2S. Besides, explicit and simple-to-use correlations were established using gene expression programming (GEP). The paradigms derived from the methods aforementioned were developed using widespread experimental database. The obtained results indicated that the outcomes gained from the proposed MLP, CFNN and GEP-based correlations are in a high coherence and agreement with the experimental data. In addition, it was found that among the all suggested schemes, CFNN models are the most accurate paradigms for estimating the solubility of sulfur in sour gas mixtures and pure H2S with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0232 and 3.8101, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison between the performance of CFNN and the prior alternatives demonstrated that the CFNN models predict the solubility of sulfur in sour gas mixtures and pure H2S more accurately. Moreover, based on the trend analysis, it was concluded that the predictions of CFNN follow the real tendency of sulfur solubility in pure H2S and sour gas mixtures with respect to the input parameters. Besides, the sensitivity analysis dictated that pressure and temperature have the most significant impact on sulfur solubility calculation in pure H2S and sour gas mixtures. The results reported in this investigation revealed that implication of the considered soft computing approaches in the estimation of sulfur solubility in sour gas mixtures and pure H2S can lead to the generation of more reliable predictive paradigms which can be integrated in other related applications. Lastly, the findings of this study can help for effective prediction of the solubility of sulfur in sour gas mixtures and pure H2S while simulating different natural gas processes.

Inverse design of the popular class of transparent conducting oxide (TCO)-based active metasurfaces is particularly challenging, largely due to the limited choice of the active materials, and sensitive physical mechanisms that give rise to their tunability. In this contribution, a new machine learning method based on a combination of the K-means clustering algorithm and conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (cWGANs) for broadband multi-modal inverse design of TCO-based active metasurfaces is developed. Multi-objective evolutionary optimization is adopted to efficiently generate a diverse training dataset of high-performance active metasurfaces. The training dataset includes samples that operate at specific wavelengths throughout the optical telecommunications (telecom) band. K-means algorithm is then used to extract the clusters (modes) present in the training dataset, and exclusive cWGAN models are fit on each of them. The model is capable of generating designs operating at wavelengths that are not present in the training dataset.

The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has opened up new possibilities for epidemiological studies of suicide and related behaviour amongst those receiving healthcare. These types of records capture valuable information entered by healthcare practitioners at the point of care. However, much recent work has relied heavily on the structured data of EHRs, whilst much of the important information about a patient's care pathway is recorded in the unstructured text of clinical notes. Accessing and structuring text data for use in clinical research, and particularly for suicide and self-harm research, is a significant challenge that is increasingly being addressed using methods from the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). In this review, we provide an overview of the range of suicide-related studies that have been carried out using the Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS): a database for epidemiological and clinical research that contains de-identified EHRs from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. We highlight the variety of clinical research questions, cohorts and techniques that have been explored for suicide and related behaviour research using CRIS, including the development of NLP and ML approaches. We demonstrate how EHR data provides comprehensive material to study prevalence of suicide and self-harm in clinical populations. Structured data alone is insufficient and NLP methods are needed to more accurately identify relevant information from EHR data. We also show how the text in clinical notes provide signals for ML approaches to suicide risk assessment. We envision increased progress in the decades to come, particularly in externally validating findings across multiple sites and countries, both in terms of clinical evidence and in terms of NLP and machine learning method transferability.","electronic health records,natural language processing,machine learning,suicide attempted,suicide completed,self-injurious behaviour",Review,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Psychiatry,,,"ELECTRONIC,HEALTH,RECORDS,SELF-HARM,MORTALITY,RISK,CAMBERWELL,DISCHARGE,DISORDER,CRITERIA,ILLNESS,PEOPLE",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729078,

When acoustic emission (AE) technology is applied for dynamic monitoring, the interfering signals often affect the damage evaluation results, which significantly influences industrial production safety. In this work, an effective intelligent recognition method for AE signals from the GFRP damage is proposed. Firstly, the wavelet packet analysis method is used to study the characteristic difference in frequency domain between the interfering and AE signals, which can be characterized by feature vector. Then, the model of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is constructed. The number of nodes in the input layer is determined according to the feature vector, and the feature vectors from different types of signals are input into the BPNN for training. Finally, the wavelet packet feature vectors of the signals collected from the experiment are input into the trained BPNN for intelligent recognition. The accuracy rate of the proposed method reaches to 97.5%, which implies that the proposed method can be used for dynamic and accurate monitoring of GFRP structures.","glass fiber-reinforced plastics,acoustic emission,wavelet packet analysis,back-propagation neural network,intelligent recognition",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,0.978,,ADVANCED COMPOSITES LETTERS,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2633366X20974683,

A reliable energy calculation engine combined with an efficient global search algorithm, such as particle swarm optimization algorithm or genetic algorithm, is needed to conduct crystal structure prediction. In recent years, machine learning-based interatomic potential energy surface models have been proposed, potentially allowing us to perform crystal structure prediction for systems with the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) and the speed of empirical force fields. In this paper, we employ a previously developed Deep Potential model to predict the intermetallic compound of the aluminum-magnesium system, and find six meta-stable phases with negative or nearly zero formation energy. In particular, Mg12Al8 shows excellent ductility and Mg5Al27 has a high Young's modulus.

The predicted instructions were evaluated using cumulative BLEU scores and input from expert physicians. The evaluation was performed under two settings: with and without providing the model with prior information from test set procedures. According to the BLEU scores, the predicted and ground truth instructions were as high as 86 +/- 1% similar.

In this study, based on the crystal graph convolutional neural networks algorithm, an end-to-end deep learning model was developed for predicting the methane adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). High-throughput grand canonical Monte Carlo calculations were carried out on the computation-ready, experimental MOF database, which contains approximately 11 000 MOFs, to construct the data set. An area under the curve of 0.930 for the test set proved the reliability of the developed deep learning model. To assess the transferability of the model, we applied it to predict the methane adsorption volume for some randomly selected covalent organic frameworks and zeolitic imidazolate framework materials. The results indicated that the model could also be suitable for other porous materials. We also applied it to the hierarchical screening of a hypothetical MOFs database (similar to 330 000 MOFs). Four hypothetical MOFs were demonstrated to have the highest performance in methane adsorption. A calculated maximum working capacity of 145 cm(3)/cm(3) at 5-35 bar and 298 K indicated that the hypothetical MOF is close to the Department of Energy's 2015 target of 180 cm3/cm3. Further analyses on all screened out MOFs established correlations between some structural features with the working capacity. The successful incorporation of ML and hierarchical screening can accelerate the discovery of new materials not just for gas adsorption, but also other areas involving interactions in materials and molecules.","metal-organic frameworks,methane adsorption,high-through computation,deep learning,hierarchical screening,quantitative structure-property relationship",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,,

Most of the representations are based on the use of atomic coordinates (structure); however, it can increase ML training and predictions' computational cost. Herein, we investigate the impact of choosing free-coordinate descriptors based on the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES representation, which can substantially reduce the ML predictions' 6 computational cost. Therefore, we evaluate a feed-forward neural network (FNN) model's prediction performance over five feature selection methods and nine ground-state properties (including energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties) from a public data set composed of similar to 130k organic molecules.

Moreover, for the atomization energies, the results obtained an out-of-sample error nine times less than the same FNN model trained with the Coulomb matrix, a traditional coordinate-based descriptor.

The interference contrast technique showed fine cell structures (important is the selection of interference colors according to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer setting). In a polarization microscope, the crossed polarization filters together with the first-order quartz compensator mounted turntable showed the maximum birefringence of the individual structures. Material containing green algae was collected in the villages Sykorice and Zbecno, Protected Landscape Area (PLA) Krivoklatsko. The objects were studied in a Carl Zeiss Jena NfpK laboratory microscope equipped with an In 160 base body with an Interphako In contrast interference module including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with variable phase contrast, a special condenser with interchangeable aperture plates, a turntable, a Meopta Praha polarizer, a LOMO Sankt Petersburg analyzer, and a quartz compensator with first-order red and the digital camera DSLR Nikon D 70. Green algae of three orders were studied: Siphonocladales, Zygnematales, and Desmidiales. Anisotropic structures were found in all studied representatives of the green algae of the phylum Chlorophyta. Especially their cell walls showed strong birefringence (in all representatives of these orders). On the other hand, a representative of the order Siphonocladales (the genus Cladophora, Cladophoraceae, Ulvophyceae) was rarely found to display weak birefringent granules of storage substances due to the setting of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the use of the first-order compensator (interference colors are intensified). In addition, a very weak birefringence of periphyton cells (microbial biofilm) was found. In the study of the second algae of the genus Spirogyra (Zygnemataceae, Zygnematales, Conjugatophyceae), a strongly birefringent connecting wall between algal cells was found in contrast to the weaker birefringence of the peripheral wall. It was the use of Interphako interference contrast together with polarization filters and a first-order quartz compensator that particularly emphasized the central part of the connecting wall. In the study of the twinned Pleurotaenium algae (Desmidiaceae, Desmidiales, Conjugatophyceae), a strongly birefringent wall was found along the periphery of the cell with a nucleus in the middle part (isthmus). In this narrowing in the center of the cell, a sharply delimited birefringent edge of the cell wall is visible, especially when using Interphako interference contrast along with crossed polarization filters and a first-order quartz compensator. In conclusion, Interphako interference contrast provides a high degree of image contrast in a microscope and, if suitably simultaneously complemented by polarization microscopy (including a first-order quartz compensator), it will allow us to infer some of the composition of the investigated structures. However, working with Interphako interference contrast is considerably more difficult (setting Mach-Zehnder interferometer) than using other contrast techniques (positive and negative phase contrast, color contrast, relief contrast, and dark field).",,Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Microbiology",,2.131,,FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,,

This is based on the fact that edges in images contain most of the semantic information. Semantic edge detection involves two tasks, namely pure edge detection and edge classification. Those are in fact fundamentally distinct in terms of the level of abstraction that each task requires. This fact is known as the distracted supervision paradox and limits the possible performance of a supervised model in semantic edge detection. In this work, we will present a novel hybrid method that is based on a combination of the model-based concept of shearlets, which provides probably optimally sparse approximations of a model class of images, and the data-driven method of a suitably designed convolutional neural network. We show that it avoids the distracted supervision paradox and achieves high performance in semantic edge detection. In addition, our approach requires significantly fewer parameters than a pure data-driven approach. Finally, we present several applications such as tomographic reconstruction and show that our approach significantly outperforms former methods, thereby also indicating the value of such hybrid methods for biomedical imaging.","multiscale geometric analysis,harmonic analysis,deep learning,feature extraction",Article,"ROYAL SOC, 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,3.148,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.2019.0841,

Therefore, detecting the molecular subtypes of this disease is an essential issue for medicine that could be facilitated using bioinformatics. This study aims to discover the molecular subtypes of breast cancer using somatic mutation profiles of tumors. Nonetheless, the somatic mutation profiles are very sparse. Therefore, a network propagation method is used in the gene interaction network to make the mutation profiles dense. Afterward, the deep embedded clustering (DEC) method is used to classify the breast tumors into four subtypes. In the next step, gene signature of each subtype is obtained using Fisher's exact test. Besides the enrichment of gene signatures in numerous biological databases, clinical and molecular analyses verify that the proposed method using mutation profiles can efficiently detect the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

This new MEBCRN network contains 2 main modules, the first 1 is the feature extraction module, which learns the correlations between consecutive echoes, and the other one is the water-fat separation module that processes the feature information extracted from the feature extraction module.

Methods Planning CT and structure datasets for 120 patients with intact prostate cancer were retrospectively selected and divided for tenfold cross-validation. The proposed adversarial multi-residual multi-scale pooling Markov random field (MRF) enhanced network (ARPM-net) implements an adversarial training scheme. A segmentation network and a discriminator network were trained jointly, and only the segmentation network was used for prediction. The segmentation network integrates a newly designed MRF block into a variation of multi-residual U-net. The discriminator takes the product of the original CT and the prediction/ground-truth as input and classifies the input into fake/real. The segmentation network and discriminator network can be trained jointly as a whole, or the discriminator can be used for fine-tuning after the segmentation network is coarsely trained. Multi-scale pooling layers were introduced to preserve spatial resolution during pooling using less memory compared to atrous convolution layers. An adaptive loss function was proposed to enhance the training on small or low contrast organs. The accuracy of modeled contours was measured with the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average Hausdorff distance (AHD), average surface Hausdorff distance (ASHD), and relative volume difference (VD) using clinical contours as references to the ground-truth. The proposed ARPM-net method was compared to several state-of-the-art deep learning methods.
Results ARPM-net outperformed several existing deep learning approaches and MRF methods and achieved state-of-the-art performance on a testing dataset. On the test set with 20 cases, the average DSC on the prostate, bladder, rectum, left femur, and right femur were 0.88 (+/- 0.11), 0.97 (+/- 0.07), 0.86 (+/- 0.12), 0.97 (+/- 0.01), and 0.97 (+/- 0.01), respectively. The average HD (mm) on these organs were 1.58 (+/- 1.77), 1.91 (+/- 1.29), 3.14 (+/- 2.39), 1.76 (+/- 1.57), and 1.92 (+/- 1.01).

We identify 13 close-packed structures, some with packings that are significantly denser than previously reported. Twelve of these are crystals with unit cells of N = 2 or N = 4 particles, but in the shape regime of slightly rounded tetrahedra we find that the densest structure is a quasicrystal approximant with a unit cell of N = 82 particles. All 13 structures are also stable below close packing, together with an additional 14th plastic crystal phase at the sphere side of the phase diagram, and upon sufficient dilution to packing fractions below 50-60% all structures melt. Interestingly, however, upon compressing the fluid phase, self-assembly takes place spontaneously only at the tetrahedron and the sphere side of the family but not in an intermediate regime of tetrahedra with rounded edges. We describe the local environment of each particle by a set of l-fold bond orientational order parameters (q) over bar (l), which we use in an extensive principal component analysis. We find that the total packing fraction as well as several particular linear combinations of (q) over bar (l) rather than individual (q) over bar (l)'s are optimally distinctive, specifically the differences (q) over bar (4) - (q) over bar (6) for separating tetragonal from hexagonal structures and (q) over bar (4)-(q) over bar (8) for distinguishing tetragonal structures. We argue that these characteristic combinations are also useful as reliable order parameters in nucleation studies, enhanced sampling techniques, or inverse-design methods involving odd-shaped particles in general.","tetrahedra,self-assembly,quasicrystal,dimensionality reduction,machine learning,nanoparticles,computer simulation",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,16.207,,ACS NANO,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsnano.0c05288,

Using a sensor platform composed of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors with control of nanogap chemistry and machine learning algorithms for analysis of complex spectral data, bacteria metabolic profiles post antibiotic exposure are correlated with susceptibility. Deep neural network models are able to discriminate the responses of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antibiotics from untreated cells in SERS data in 10 min after antibiotic exposure with greater than 99% accuracy. Deep learning analysis is also able to differentiate responses from untreated cells with antibiotic dosages up to 10-fold lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration observed in conventional growth assays. In addition, analysis of SERS data using a generative model, a variational autoencoder, identifies spectral features in the P. aeruginosa lysate data associated with antibiotic efficacy. From this insight, a combinatorial dataset of metabolites is selected to extend the latent space of the variational autoencoder. This culture-free dataset dramatically improves classification accuracy to select effective antibiotic treatment in 30 min. Unsupervised Bayesian Gaussian mixture analysis achieves 99.3% accuracy in discriminating between susceptible versus resistant to antibiotic cultures in SERS using the extended latent space. Discriminative and generative models rapidly provide high classification accuracy with small sets of labeled data, which enormously reduces the amount of time needed to validate phenotypic AST with conventional growth assays. Thus, this work outlines a promising approach toward practical rapid AST.","surface-enhanced Raman scattering,machine learning,deep neural networks,variational autoencoders,generative deep learning,antimicrobial susceptibility testing,antimicrobial resistance",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,16.207,"ENHANCED,RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY,DESORPTION,IONIZATION-TIME,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SERS,SCATTERING,QUANTIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION,RESISTANCE,BIOMARKERS,DIAGNOSIS",ACS NANO,,

We implemented a combinatorial, material discovery approach that used pulsed laser deposition (PLD) for thin-film growth, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase determination, and machine learning for data reduction. A lateral compositional gradient of TaOxNy was grown across the surface of an alpha-Al2O3 (012) wafer. After annealing, XRD scattering patterns were collected across the lateral gradient. Unsupervised machine learning separated the XRD data into four clusters (phases); one of which turned out to be the desired monoclinic beta-TaON phase. Using high-resolution XRD, we determined that the beta-TaON region of the film was a 260 angstrom thick single-crystal epitaxial with the substrate, having out-of-plane beta-TaON (100)//alpha-Al2O3 (012) and in-plane beta-TaON (010)//alpha-Al2O3 (2 (1) over bar0). X-ray reflectivity (XRR) analysis of the beta-TaON region of the film showed an electron density matching that expected for beta-TaON.

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted every aspect of life, including how people exercise and access fitness resources. Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context.

Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD.

Hendrik,King Michael A.","Liu JC,Yang YY,Wernick MN,Pretorius PH,King MA",Yang YY,10.1002/mp.14577,Illinois Institute of Technology,"Purpose: Post-reconstruction filtering is often applied for noise suppression due to limited data counts in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We study a deep learning (DL) approach for denoising in conventional SPECT-MPI acquisitions, and investigate whether it can be more effective for improving the detectability of perfusion defects compared to traditional postfiltering.
Methods: Owing to the lack of ground truth in clinical studies, we adopt a noise-to-noise (N2N) training approach for denoising in SPECT-MPI images. We consider a coupled U-Net (CU-Net) structure which is designed to improve learning efficiency through feature map reuse. For network training we employ a bootstrap procedure to generate multiple noise realizations from list-mode clinical acquisitions. In the experiments we demonstrated the proposed approach on a set of 895 clinical studies, where the iterative OSEM algorithm with three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian postfiltering was used to reconstruct the images. We investigated the detection performance of perfusion defects in the reconstructed images using the non-prewhitening matched filter (NPWMF), evaluated the uniformity of left ventricular (LV) wall in terms of image intensity, and quantified the effect of smoothing on the spatial resolution of the reconstructed LV wall by using its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM).
Results: Compared to OSEM with Gaussian postfiltering, the DL denoised images with CU-Net significantly improved the detection performance of perfusion defects at all contrast levels (65%, 50%, 35%, and 20%). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNRD) in the NPWMF output was increased on average by 8% over optimal Gaussian smoothing (P < 10(-4), paired t-test), while the inter-subject variability was greatly reduced. The CU-Net also outperformed a 3D nonlocal means (NLM) filter and a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) denoising network in terms of SNRD. In addition, the FWHM of the LV wall in the reconstructed images was varied by less than 1%. Furthermore, CU-Net also improved the detection performance when the images were processed with less post-reconstruction smoothing (a trade-off of increased noise for better LV resolution), with SNRD improved on average by 23%.
Conclusions: The proposed DL with N2N training approach can yield additional noise suppression in SPECT-MPI images over conventional postfiltering. For perfusion defect detection, DL with CU-Net could outperform conventional 3D Gaussian filtering with optimal setting as well as NLM and CAE.

Traditional models identify the burns from the image and distinguish the region as burn and non-burn regions. However, the earlier models cannot accurately classify the wound region and also requires more time in the prediction of burns. Also, the burn depth analysis is an important factor for the calculation of the percentage of burn depth i.e. degree of severity is analyzed by Total body surface area (TBSA). For those issues, we design a hybrid approach named DenseMask Regional convolutional neural network (RCNN) approach for segmenting the skin burn region based on the various degrees of burn severity. In this, hybrid integration of Mask-region based convolution neural network CNN (Mask R-CNN) and dense pose estimation are integrated into DenseMask RCNN that calculate the full-body human pose and performs semantic segmentation. At first, we use the Residual Network with a dilated convolution using a weighted mapping model to generate the dense feature map. Then the feature map is fed into the Region proposal network (RPN) which utilizes a Feature pyramid network (FPN) to detect the objects at different scales of location and pyramid level from the input images. For the accurate alignment of pixel-to-pixel labels, we introduce a Region of interest (RoI)-pose align module that properly aligns the objects based on the human pose with the characteristics of scale, right-left, translation, and left-right flip to a standard scale. After the alignment task, a cascaded fully convolutional architecture is employed on the top of the RoI module that performs mask segmentation and dense pose regression task simultaneously. Finally, the transfer learning model classifies the detected burn regions into three classes of wound depths. Experimental analysis is performed on the burn dataset and the result obtained shows better accuracy than the state-of-art approaches.","Skin burn image segmentation,Burn diagnosis,Mask R-CNN,Object detection,Instance segmentation",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,2.884,,NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS,,

The implementation of 2.5D model shows promising results since it allows the network to have a deeper and wider network architecture while still accommodates the 3D information. However, there has been no detailed investigation of the parameter configurations on this type of network model. Methods Some parameters, such as the number of stacked layers, image contrast, and the number of network layers, were studied and implemented on neural networks based on 2.5D model. Networks are trained and tested by utilizing the dataset from liver and tumor segmentation challenge (LiTS). The network performance was further evaluated by comparing the network segmentation with manual segmentation from nine technical physicians and an experienced radiologist. Results Slice arrangement testing shows that multiple stacked layers have better performance than a single-layer network. However, the dice scores start decreasing when the number of stacked layers is more than three layers. Adding higher number of layers would cause overfitting on the training set. In contrast enhancement test, implementing contrast enhancement method did not show a statistically significant different to the network performance. While in the network layer test, adding more layers to the network architecture does not always correspond to the increasing dice score result of the network.

In this study, a deep learning model called BrainMRNet which is developed for mass detection in open-source brain magnetic resonance images was used. The BrainMRNet model includes three processing steps: attention modules, the hypercolumn technique, and residual blocks. To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model, three types of tumor data leading to brain cancer were examined in this study: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary. In addition, a segmentation method was proposed, which additionally determines in which lobe area of the brain the two classes of tumors that cause brain cancer are more concentrated. The classification accuracy rates were performed in the study; it was 98.18% in glioma tumor, 96.73% in meningioma tumor, and 98.18% in pituitary tumor. At the end of the experiment, using the subset of glioma and meningioma tumor images, it was determined which at brain lobe the tumor region was seen, and 100% success was achieved in the analysis of this determination. In this study, a hybrid deep learning model is presented to determine the detection of the brain tumor. In addition, open-source software was proposed, which statistically found in which lobe region of the human brain the brain tumor occurred.

Developing automatic segmentation tools in a short period with limited labelled images has become an urgent need. Pseudo label-based semi-supervised method is a promising way to leverage unlabelled data to improve segmentation performance. Existing methods usually obtain pseudo labels by first training a network with limited labelled images and then inferring unlabelled images. However, these methods may generate obviously inaccurate labels and degrade the subsequent training process. To address these challenges, in this paper, an active contour regularized semi-supervised learning framework was proposed to automatically segment infections with few labelled images. The active contour regularization was realized by the region-scalable fitting (RSF) model which is embedded to the loss function of the network to regularize and refine the pseudo labels of the unlabelled images. We further designed a splitting method to separately optimize the RSF regularization term and the segmentation loss term with iterative convolution-thresholding method and stochastic gradient descent, respectively, which enable fast optimization of each term. Furthermore, we built a statistical atlas to show the infection spatial distribution. Extensive experiments on a small public dataset and a large scale dataset showed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5% in dice similarity coefficient and normalized surface dice, 10% in relative absolute volume difference and 8 mm in 95% Hausdorff distance. Moreover, we observed that the infections tend to occur at the dorsal subpleural lung and posterior basal segments that are not mentioned in current radiology reports and are meaningful to advance our understanding of COVID-19.","COVID-19 infection segmentation,active contours,statistical atlas,infection spatial distribution",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,ENHANCEMENT,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,
12,RegQCNET: Deep quality control for image-to-template brain MRI affine registration,65,22,,"Denis de Senneville Baudouin,Manjon Jose V,Coupe Pierrick","de Senneville BD,Manjon JV,Coupe P",de Senneville BD,10.1088/1361-6560/abb6be,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Affine registration of one or several brain image(s) onto a common reference space is a necessary prerequisite for many image processing tasks, such as brain segmentation or functional analysis. Manual assessment of registration quality is a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in studies comprising a large amount of data. Automated and reliable quality control (QC) becomes mandatory. Moreover, the computation time of the QC must be also compatible with the processing of massive datasets. Therefore, automated deep neural network approaches have emerged as a method of choice to automatically assess registration quality.
In the current study, a compact 3D convolutional neural network, referred to as RegQCNET, is introduced to quantitatively predict the amplitude of an affine registration mismatch between a registered image and a reference template. This quantitative estimation of registration error is expressed using the metric unit system. Therefore, a meaningful task-specific threshold can be manually or automatically defined in order to distinguish between usable and non-usable images.
The robustness of the proposed RegQCNET is first analyzed on lifespan brain images undergoing various simulated spatial transformations and intensity variations between training and testing. Secondly, the potential of RegQCNET to classify images as usable or non-usable is evaluated using both manual and automatic thresholds. During our experiments, automatic thresholds are estimated using several computer-assisted classification models (logistic regression, support vector machine, Naive Bayes and random forest) through cross-validation. To this end we use an expert's visual QC estimated on a lifespan cohort of 3953 brains. Finally, the RegQCNET accuracy is compared to usual image features such as image correlation coefficient and mutual information.
The results show that the proposed deep learning QC is robust, fast and accurate at estimating affine registration error in the processing pipeline.","quality control,image-to-template registration,deep neural network",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"RADIATION-THERAPY,ANTS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02941116/document,

It is also a time consuming task and automated identification methods have been suggested as an improvement for both objectives. Multi-echo gradient echo (MEGRE) images have been utilized for manual fiducial identification with 100% detection accuracy. The aim is therefore to develop an automatic deep learning based method for fiducial identification in MRI images intended for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy. MEGRE images from 326 prostate cancer patients with fiducials were acquired on a 3T MRI, post-processed with N4 bias correction, and the fiducial center of mass (CoM) was identified. A 9 mm radius sphere was created around the CoM as ground truth. A deep learning HighRes3DNet model for semantic segmentation was trained using image augmentation. The model was applied to 39 MRI-only patients and 3D probability maps for fiducial location and segmentation were produced and spatially smoothed. In each of the three largest probability peaks, a 9 mm radius sphere was defined. Detection sensitivity and geometric accuracy was assessed. To raise awareness of potential false findings a 'BeAware' score was developed, calculated from the total number and quality of the probability peaks. All datasets, annotations and source code used were made publicly available. The detection sensitivity for all fiducials were 97.4%. Thirty-six out of thirty-nine patients had all fiducial markers correctly identified. All three failed patients generated a user notification using the BeAware score. The mean absolute difference between the detected fiducial and ground truth CoM was 0.7 +/- 0.9 [0 3.1] mm. A deep learning method for automatic fiducial identification in MRI images was developed and evaluated with state-of-the-art results. The BeAware score has the potential to notify the user regarding patients where the proposed method is uncertain.","gold fiducial marker,MRI only prostate,MRI only radiotherapy,MRI radiation therapy,prostate cancer,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY,REGISTRATION,TARGET,UNCERTAINTIES,SIMULATION,MARGINS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb0f9,

In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation algorithm that imposes two-tier constraints on a conventional network through adversarial learning, namely UDCGAN. Specifically, we incorporate a dual adversarial training scheme in a conventional segmentation network, which further facilitates the probability maps from the segmentor to converge on the ground truth distributions owing to the effectiveness of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in capturing data distributions. This novel segmentation algorithm is equivalent to employing adversarial learning on a segmentation network that has been trained in an adversarial manner. Duplex intervention and guidance further refine the loss functions of the segmentor, thus effectively contributing to the preservation of details for segmentation.

In this study, the feasibility and efficacy of deep learning for the automatic segmentation of ATAAs was investigated using UNet, ENet, and ERFNet techniques. Specifically, CT angiography done on 72 patients with ATAAs and different valve morphology (i.e., tricuspid aortic valve, TAV, and bicuspid aortic valve, BAV) were semi-automatically segmented with Mimics software (Materialize NV, Leuven, Belgium), and then used for training of the tested deep learning models. The segmentation performance in terms of accuracy and time inference were compared using several parameters. All deep learning models reported a dice score higher than 88%, suggesting a good agreement between predicted and manual ATAA segmentation. We found that the ENet and UNet are more accurate than ERFNet, with the ENet much faster than UNet. This study demonstrated that deep learning models can rapidly segment and quantify the 3D geometry of ATAAs with high accuracy, thereby facilitating the expansion into clinical workflow of personalized approach to the management of patients with ATAAs.","Deep learning,Segmentation,Aorta,Aneurysm,Aortic valve",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,"BICUSPID,AORTOPATHY,DISSECTION,VALVE,RISK",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LETTERS,,

Due to the increase in road accidents, it has become an important issue to identify risky driving behaviors and reward people who drive safely. With the development of technology, it is now possible to model driving behavior through advanced sensors integrated into embedded systems. In this study, we modeled four major risky driving behaviors and created driver profiles using data obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors and applying widely used machine learning algorithms in behavior analysis, including the C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Support-Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and K-Star algorithms. Risky driving behaviors and their risk levels were evaluated in accordance with the expert opinions of traffic officers, and driver risk was modeled using the fuzzy logic method. The applied machine learning algorithms were compared using common validation metrics such as accuracy, f-measure, precision, and recall. In our experiments, the K-Star algorithm was the most successful algorithm, with 100% accuracy. As a result, a highly accurate, low-cost system which acts as the driver's black box was developed. The system can be integrated into vehicles and it can record the driver's behaviors and identify the risky ones. It can also open up new horizons for insurance companies to utilize usage-based policies, in which customers who drive safely are rewarded with lower car insurance premiums, encouraging others to do the same.","driver analytics,driving behavior analysis,fuzzy logic,intelligent systems,machine learning,risk assessment,road safety",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Transportation,,4.134,,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,,

In this study, deep learning models were developed for predicting the amount (in tons) of salvage and waste materials that are obtainable from buildings at the end-of-life prior to demolition. Datasets used for deep neural network model developments were extracted from 2280 building demolition records obtained from the practitioners in the UK Demolition Industry. The data was partitioned into training, testing and validation datasets in the ratio 8:1:1. Deep learning models were developed with a deep learning framework in R programming environment. The average R-squared value for the three deep learning models is 0.97 with Mean Absolute Error between 17.93 and 19.04. The models were evaluated with four scenarios of a case study building design. The results of the evaluation show that, given basic features of buildings, it is possible to predict with a high level of accuracy, the amount of materials that would be recovered from a building after demolition.

This stochastic inversion formulation infers a distribution of acceptable/consistent microstructures, as opposed to a deterministic solution, which expands the range of feasible designs in a probabilistic manner. To solve this stochastic inverse problem, we employ a recently developed uncertainty quantification framework based on push-forward probability measures, which combines techniques from measure theory and Bayes' rule to define a unique and numerically stable solution. This approach requires making an initial prediction using an initial guess for the distribution on model inputs and solving a stochastic forward problem.

We focus more on the latter, where ML interacts intimately with first-principles calculations for predicting the key properties (e.g., molecular adsorption energy) and evaluating potential energy surface (PES) to expedite the atomic simulation. The ML-based PES exploration represents the top gear that can largely replace the traditional roles of first-principles calculations for structure determination and activity evaluation but requires efficient methods for data set generation, sensitive structure descriptors to discriminate structures, and iterative self-learning to refine the ML potential. We illustrate these key ingredients of ML-based atomic simulation using the SSW-NN method developed by our group as the example. Three cases of SSW-NN application are presented to elaborate how ML can expedite the material and reaction simulation and lead to new findings on catalyst structure and reaction channels.

Efficiently exploiting various scaling relations, this approach draws its predictive character from reliable adsorption energies, typically calculated with density-functional theory (DFT). In prevalent screening approaches, the concomitant computational costs are kept tractable through the use of reductionist microkinetic models that only resolve a minimalistic amount of active site motifs at the catalyst surface. Her; we scrutinize this common practice by systematically comparing the screening predictions for the CO methanation reaction when using microkinetic models that resolve an increasing amount of sites, up to the full consideration of all high-symmetry sites at stepped transition metal (TM) and binary TM alloy catalysts. Apart from generally overestimating the catalytic activity, the simplified models fail to identify a most promising class of layered bimetallic alloys as their insufficient representation of the catalyst surface does not allow them to correctly capture the rate-determining step. Only the full microkinetic model provides this proper mechanistic basis for the screening. The excessive amount of predictive-quality adsorption energetics required for this model is obtained from a compressed sensing descriptor that once trained readily provides these data for a new material from a single DFT calculation of the clean surface. With the current methodological advances in areas such as compressed sensing and machine learning, and the concurrent availability of cheap adsorption energetics for a wide range of possible catalyst materials, there is thus no reason to continue to use simplistic microkinetic models in computational catalyst screening.","computational screening,heterogeneous catalysis,active site representation,density functional theory,microkinetic modeling,compressed sensing,machine learning",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,13.721,,ACS CATALYSIS,,

Many researchers in recent years have studied the non-invasive BCI systems. However, the efficiency of the intention decoding algorithm is affected by the random non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio characteristics of the EEG signal. Furthermore, channel selection is another important issue in BCI systems intention recognition. During intention recognition in BCI systems, the unnecessary information produced by redundant electrodes affects the decoding rate and deplete system resources. In this paper, we introduce a recurrent-convolution neural network model for intention recognition by learning decomposed spatio-temporal representations. We apply the novel Gradient-Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technology to the channel selection. Grad-CAM uses the gradient of any classification, flowing into the last convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map. Since the pixels of the localization map correspond to the spatial regions where the electrodes are placed, we select the channels that are more important for decision-making. We conduct an experiment using the public motor imagery EEG dataset EEGMMIDB. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of 97.36% at the full channel, outperforming many state-of-the-art models and baseline models. Although the decoding rate of our model is the same as the best model compared, our model has fewer parameters with faster training time. After the channel selection, our model maintains the intention decoding performance of 92.31% while reducing the number of channels by nearly half and saving system resources.

This paper studies the technical foundation for measuring the target-perceptual ability in a guided visual search task, using the EEG-based brain imaging technique. Specifically, it focuses on the feature representation learning problem for single-trial classification of fixation-related potentials (FRPs). The existing methods either capture only first-order statistics while ignoring second-order statistics in data, or directly extract second-order statistics with covariance matrices estimated with raw FRPs that suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning pipeline involving a low-level convolution subnetwork followed by a high-level Riemannian manifold subnetwork, with a novel midlevel pooling layer bridging them. In this way, the discriminative power of the first-order features can be increased by the convolution subnetwork, while the second-order information in the convolutional features could further be deeply learned with the subsequent Riemannian subnetwork. In particular, the temporal ordering of FRPs is well preserved for the components in our pipeline, which is considered to be a valuable source of discriminant information. The experimental results show that proposed approach leads to improved classification performance and robustness to lack of data over the state-of-the-art ones, thus making it appealing for practical applications in measuring the target-perceptual ability of cognitively impaired patients with the FRP technique.",,Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Health Care Sciences & Services,,3.188,,JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2020/8829451.pdf,

The PICAFO used two kinds of sensors, such as Electromyography (EMG) signal and ankle position (two inputs) to determine the amount of stiffness (one output) to be generated by the MR brake. As the overall weight and design of an orthotic device must be optimized, the sensor numbers on PICAFO wanted to be reduced. To do that, a machine learning approach was implemented to simplify the previous stiffness function. In this paper, Non-linear Autoregressive Exogeneous (NARX) neural network were used to generate the simplified function. A total of 2060 data were used to build the network with detail such as 1309 training data, 281 validation data, 281 testing data 1, and 189 testing data 2. Three training algorithms were used such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient. The result shows that the function can be simplified into one input (ankle position) - one output (stiffness). Optimized result was shown by the NARX neural network with 15 hidden layers and trained using Bayesian Regularization with delay 2.

However, the lack of diverse representation within both scientific and participant populations in contemplative neuroscience may limit generalizability and translation of prior findings. To address these issues, we propose a research framework called Intersectional Neuroscience which adapts research procedures to be more inclusive of under-represented groups. Intersectional Neuroscience builds inclusive processes into research design using two main approaches: 1) community engagement with diverse participants, and 2) individualized multivariate neuroscience methods to accommodate neural diversity. We tested the feasibility of this framework in partnership with a diverse U.S. meditation center (East Bay Meditation Center, Oakland, CA). Using focus group and community feedback, we adapted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) screening and recruitment procedures to be inclusive of participants from various under-represented groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, gender and sexual minorities, people with disabilities, neuropsychiatric disorders, and/or lower income. Using person-centered screening and study materials, we recruited and scanned 15 diverse meditators (80% racial/ethnic minorities, 53% gender and sexual minorities). The participants completed the EMBODY task - which applies individualized machine learning algorithms to fMRI data - to identify mental states during breath-focused meditation, a basic skill that stabilizes attention to support interoception and compassion. All 15 meditators' unique brain patterns were recognized by machine learning algorithms significantly above chance levels. These individualized brain patterns were used to decode the internal focus of attention throughout a 10-min breath-focused meditation period, specific to each meditator. These data were used to compile individual-level attention profiles during meditation, such as the percentage time attending to the breath, mind wandering, or engaging in self-referential processing. This study provides feasibility of employing an intersectional neuroscience approach to include diverse participants and develop individualized neural metrics of meditation practice. Through inclusion of more under-represented groups while developing reciprocal partnerships, intersectional neuroscience turns the research process into an embodied form of social action.","meditation,interoception,neuroscience,diversity,community engagement,intersectionality,mindfulness,machine learning",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Psychology,,3.618,"PATTERN-ANALYSIS,MEDITATION,RESPONSES,SCIENCE,MODEL",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7637052n/qt7637052n.pdf?t=qmrb14,

Lesion segmentation on ABUS is a prerequisite step of breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). This work aims to develop a deep learning-based method for breast tumor segmentation using three-dimensional (3D) ABUS automatically.
Methods For breast tumor segmentation in ABUS, we developed a Mask scoring region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that consists of five subnetworks, that is, a backbone, a regional proposal network, a region convolutional neural network head, a mask head, and a mask score head. A network block building direct correlation between mask quality and region class was integrated into a Mask scoring R-CNN based framework for the segmentation of new ABUS images with ambiguous regions of interest (ROIs). For segmentation accuracy evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 70 patients with breast tumor confirmed with needle biopsy and manually delineated on ABUS, of which 40 were used for fivefold cross-validation and 30 were used for hold-out test. The comparison between the automatic breast tumor segmentations and the manual contours was quantified by I) six metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard index, 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance (RMSD), and center of mass distance (CMD); II) Pearson correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis.
Results The mean (median) DSC was 85% +/- 10.4% (89.4%) and 82.1% +/- 14.5% (85.6%) for cross-validation and hold-out test, respectively. The corresponding HD95, MSD, RMSD, and CMD of the two tests was 1.646 +/- 1.191 and 1.665 +/- 1.129 mm, 0.489 +/- 0.406 and 0.475 +/- 0.371 mm, 0.755 +/- 0.755 and 0.751 +/- 0.508 mm, and 0.672 +/- 0.612 and 0.665 +/- 0.729 mm. The mean volumetric difference (mean and +/- 1.96 standard deviation) was 0.47 cc ([-0.77, 1.71)) for the cross-validation and 0.23 cc ([-0.23 0.69]) for hold-out test, respectively.

However, polarization microscopy systems typically operate by analyzing images collected from two or more light paths in different states of polarization, which lead to relatively complex optical designs, high system costs, or experienced technicians being required. Here, we present a deep learning-based holographic polarization microscope that is capable of obtaining quantitative birefringence retardance and orientation information of specimen from a phase-recovered hologram, while only requiring the addition of one polarizer/analyzer pair to an inline lensfree holographic imaging system. Using a deep neural network, the reconstructed holographic images from a single state of polarization can be transformed into images equivalent to those captured using a single-shot computational polarized light microscope (SCPLM). Our analysis shows that a trained deep neural network can extract the birefringence information using both the sample specific morphological features as well as the holographic amplitude and phase distribution. To demonstrate the efficacy of this method, we tested it by imaging various birefringent samples including, for example, monosodium urate and triamcinolone acetonide crystals. Our method achieves similar results to SCPLM both qualitatively and quantitatively, and due to its simpler optical design and significantly larger field-of-view this method has the potential to expand the access to polarization microscopy and its use for medical diagnosis in resource limited settings.","polarization microscopy,holographic microscopy,deep learning,convolutional neural networks,on-chip microscopy,lensless microscopy",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Optics,Physics",,7.718,,ACS PHOTONICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345334,

Methods Two neural networks (1 for frequency, 1 for phase) consisting of fully connected layers were trained and validated using simulated MEGA-edited MRS data. This DL-FPC was subsequently tested and compared to a conventional approach (spectral registration [SR]) and to a model-based SR implementation (mSR) using in vivo MEGA-edited MRS datasets. Additional artificial offsets were added to these datasets to further investigate performance.
Results The validation showed that DL-based FPC was capable of correcting within 0.03 Hz of frequency and 0.4 degrees of phase offset for unseen simulated data. DL-based FPC performed similarly to SR for the unmanipulated in vivo test datasets. When additional offsets were added to these datasets, the networks still performed well. However, although SR accurately corrected for smaller offsets, it often failed for larger offsets. The mSR algorithm performed well for larger offsets, which was because the model was generated from the in vivo datasets. In addition, the computation times were much shorter using DL-based FPC or mSR compared to SR for heavily distorted spectra.

In recent years, deep learning technique has shown remarkable advantages in the clinical practice. Researchers have attempted to use deep learning methods to detect brain diseases from CT images. Methods often used to detect diseases choose images with visible lesions from full-slice brain CT scans, which need to be labelled by doctors. This is an inaccurate method because doctors detect brain disease from a full sequence scan of CT images and one patient may have multiple concurrent conditions in practice. The method cannot take into account the dependencies between the slices and the causal relationships among various brain diseases. Moreover, labelling images slice by slice spends much time and expense. Detecting multiple diseases from full slice brain CT images is, therefore, an important research subject with practical implications.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a model called the slice dependencies learning model (SDLM). It learns image features from a series of variable length brain CT images and slice dependencies between different slices in a set of images to predict abnormalities. The model is necessary to only label the disease reflected in the full-slice brain scan. We use the CQ500 dataset to evaluate our proposed model, which contains 1194 full sets of CT scans from a total of 491 subjects. Each set of data from one subject contains scans with one to eight different slice thicknesses and various diseases that are captured in a range of 30 to 396 slices in a set. The evaluation results present that the precision is 67.57%, the recall is 61.04%, the F1 score is 0.6412, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) is 0.8934.ConclusionThe proposed model is a new architecture that uses a full-slice brain CT scan for multi-label classification, unlike the traditional methods which only classify the brain images at the slice level. It has great potential for application to multi-label detection problems, especially with regard to the brain CT images.","Bioinformatics,Brain computerised tomography,Machine learning,Deep learning,Computer aided diagnosis",Article; Proceedings Paper,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-020-3503-0,

Recent studies show great promises for improving the performance of EMCI identification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and shortest path length. However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of EMCI identification have always been a challenging problem. To address this problem, in this study we propose a new EMCI identification framework using multi-modal data and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly, we extract grey matter volume and shortest path length of each brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas as feature representation from T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject, respectively. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in identifying EMCI, a common multi-task feature selection method is applied. Afterwards, we construct a non-fully labelled subject graph using imaging and non-imaging phenotypic measures of each subject. Finally, a GCN model is adopted to perform the EMCI identification task.ResultsOur proposed EMCI identification method is evaluated on 210 subjects, including 105 subjects with EMCI and 105 normal controls (NCs), with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Within this context, one issue is the lack of efficient noncontact techniques for respiratory monitoring. In this paper, we present a novel noncontact solution for real-time respiratory monitoring and function assessment of ICU patients.
Methods The proposed system uses a Time-of-Flight depth sensor to analyze the patient's chest wall morphological changes in order to estimate multiple respiratory function parameters. The automatic detection of the patient's torso is also proposed using a deep neural network model trained on the COCO dataset. The evaluation of the proposed system was performed on a mannequin and on 16 mechanically ventilated patients (a total of 216 recordings) admitted in the ICU of the Brest University Hospital.
Results The estimation of respiratory parameters (respiratory rate and tidal volume) showed high correlation with the reference method (r = 0.99; P P < 0.001) in the mannequin recordings and (r = 0.95, P < 0.001 and r = 0.90, P < 0.001) for patients.
Conclusion This study describes and evaluates a novel noncontact monitoring system suitable for continuous monitoring of key respiratory parameters for disease assessment of critically ill patients.","Intensive Care Unit,noncontact monitoring,respiratory function,surface imaging",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"HEART-FAILURE,TIDAL,VOLUME,KINECT,SYSTEM,MOTION,RADIOTHERAPY,IMPEDANCE,SENSOR,VENTILATION,VALIDATION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

The regularization is given by a sparse approximation of all image patches using a learned dictionary, that is, an overcomplete set of basis functions learned from data. Despite its competitiveness, DL and SC require the tuning of two essential hyperparameters: the sparsity level S - the number of basis functions of the dictionary, called atoms, which are used to approximate each patch, and K - the overall number of such atoms in the dictionary. These two hyperparameters usually have to be chosen a priori and are determined by repetitive and computationally expensive experiments. Furthermore, the final reported values vary depending on the specific situation. As a result, the clinical application of the method is limited, as standardized reconstruction protocols have to be used.
Methods In this work, we use adaptive DL and propose a novel adaptive sparse coding algorithm for two-dimensional (2D) radial cine MR image reconstruction. Using adaptive DL and adaptive SC, the optimal dictionary size K as well as the optimal sparsity level S are chosen dependent on the considered data.
Results Our three main results are the following: First, adaptive DL and adaptive SC deliver results which are comparable or better than the most widely used nonadaptive version of DL and SC. Second, the time needed for the regularization is accelerated due to the fact that the sparsity level S is never overestimated. Finally, the a priori choice of S and K is no longer needed but is optimally chosen dependent on the data under consideration.
Conclusions Adaptive DL and adaptive SC can highly facilitate the application of DL- and SC-based regularization methods. While in this work we focused on 2D radial cine MR image reconstruction, we expect the method to be applicable to different imaging modalities as well.","adaptive dictionary learning,adaptive sparse coding,compressed sensing,parameter estimation,radial cine MRI,unsupervised learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"MATCHING,PURSUIT,ALGORITHM,QUALITY",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.14547,

Yet, the specific length scales at which domain walls impact characteristic parameters remain largely unprobed. Previous studies examining correlation of domain wall proximity and functional response at the micrometer or submicrometer scales are often based on (locally or globally) ""written"" domains. The stability of such domains can be affected by many factors, resulting in convoluted effects of domain wall proximity and their stability when studying the local functional response. Herein, the effects of preexisting domain walls on the nanoscale polarization switching in a [001]-cut relaxor-ferroelectric 0.60Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.40PbTiO3 single crystal are probed by piezoresponse force microscopy. It is found that domain wall proximity has limited impact on polarization switching for locations less than or similar to 300 nm away. While a transition from a growth- to nucleation-limited regime and/or change in dimensionality of domain growth is possibly observed, the effective impact on nucleation voltage does not exceed 25% variation. These results are consistent with the well-documented pervasive chemical, polar, and structural heterogeneities present in relaxor- ferroelectrics and the resulting ""soft"" piezoelectric behavior.","domain walls,machine learning,piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM),relaxor-ferroelectrics,statistical analysis",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Materials Science,Physics",,1.797,"ULTRAHIGH,PIEZOELECTRICITY,CERAMICS,DEPENDENCE,BEHAVIOR,STRAIN",PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,,

A flexible printed circuit board substrate with parallel electrodes distributed across its surface was designed. Zinc oxide films were then deposited on the flexible substrate at different temperatures via atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (AP-CVD) using a spatial atomic layer deposition system. AP-CVD is a promising high-throughput thin film deposition technique with applications in flexible electronics. Collecting data on the film properties in-situ allows us to directly observe how deposition conditions affect the evolution of those properties in real-time. The spatial uniformity of the growing film was monitored, and the various stages of film nucleation and growth on the polymer substrate were observed. The measured resistance of the films was observed to be very high until a critical amount of material has been deposited, consistent with Volmer-Weber growth. Furthermore, monitoring the film resistance during post-deposition cooling enabled immediate identification of metallic or semiconducting behaviour within the conductive ZnO films. This technique allows for a more complete understanding of metal chalcogen film growth and properties, and the high volume of data generated will be useful for future implementations of machine-learning directed materials science.","ATOMIC-LAYER DEPOSITION,OXIDE LAYERS,GROWTH",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"ATOMIC-LAYER,DEPOSITION,OXIDE,LAYERS,GROWTH",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672091,

One of the most important hurdles in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and lack of medical tests. Computed tomography (CT) scans are promising in providing accurate and fast detection of COVID-19. However, determining COVID-19 requires highly trained radiologists and suffers from inter-observer variability. To remedy these limitations, this paper introduces an automatic methodology based on an ensemble of deep transfer learning for the detection of COVID-19. Methods A total of 15 pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures: EfficientNets(B0-B5), NasNetLarge, NasNetMobile, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, SeResnet 50, Xception, DenseNet121, ResNext50 and Inception_resnet_v2 are used and then fine-tuned on the target task. After that, we built an ensemble method based on majority voting of the best combination of deep transfer learning outputs to further improve the recognition performance. We have used a publicly available dataset of CT scans, which consists of 349 CT scans labeled as being positive for COVID-19 and 397 negative COVID-19 CT scans that are normal or contain other types of lung diseases. Results The experimental results indicate that the majority voting of 5 deep transfer learning architecture with EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB5, Inception_resnet_v2, and Xception has the higher results than the individual transfer learning structure and among the other models based on precision (0.857), recall (0.854) and accuracy (0.85) metrics in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans.

Despite this procedure presents many clinical advantages, relatively poor information is available about the loss of functionality of triceps surae of the treated leg. In this study, a group of patients who underwent a soleus muscle flap surgical procedure has been analyzed through the heel rise test (HRT), in order to explore the triceps surae residual functionalities. A frequency band analysis was performed in order to assess whether the residual heads of triceps surae exhibit different characteristics with respect to both the non-treated lower limb and an age-matched control group. Then, an in-depth analysis based on a machine learning approach was proposed for discriminating between groups by generalizing across new unseen subjects. Experimental results showed the reliability of the proposed analyses for discriminating between-group at a specific time epoch and the high interpretability of the proposed machine learning algorithm allowed the temporal localization of the most discriminative frequency bands. Findings of this study highlighted that significant differences can be recognized in the myoelectric spectral characteristics between the treated and contralateral leg in patients who underwent soleus flap surgery.

A machine learning regression based group contribution method (GCM) is proposed to simultaneously predict CN, RON and MON of pure fuel compounds and mixtures. The GCM extracts the structural features of fuel molecules to build a molecular structure matrix. Then a mathematical model developed by machine learning correlates the molecular structure matrix with ignition quality (CN, RON, MON) matrix. A comprehensive fuel ignition quality database is built for model training which contains 603, 374, 371 compounds for CN, RON and MON respectively. High predictive precision is obtained for CN, RON, MON (R-2 equal to 0.9911, 0.9874, 0.9731) being superior to those obtained by neural network. The method is successfully applied to a wide range of compounds including alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, aromatics, alcohols, aldehydes/ketones, ethers, esters, acids, furans and fuel mixtures. Three key factors contribute to the high predictive capacity: (i) GCM considers the structural features, functional group interaction and fuel reactivity of fuel molecules; (ii) the built-in machine learning algorithm automatically optimizes the model function and parameters and (iii) the fuel ignition quality database provides adequate model training data for different fuel types.

Again, the feature sets or the subspace features that are used to represent clusters are different for different clusters. Moreover, in subspace clustering, the grouping of similar objects and the subspace feature set representing that group are identified simultaneously. In evolutionary-based machine learning problems, two critical measures to determine the quality of the generated clusters are compactness within and separation between the clusters. However, the distance-based separation between two clusters may not be useful in the context of subspace clustering, as the clusters may belong to two different subspaces. Again, in the case of subspace clustering, the selection of relevant subspace features plays a primary role in generating good quality subspace clusters. Therefore, the proposed approach optimizes the subspace features by considering two new objective functions, feature non-redundancy (FNR) and feature per cluster (FPC) represented in the form of PSMindex. Another objective function, intra-cluster compactness (ICC-index), is modified and used to optimize the compactness among objects within the cluster. Finally, an evolutionary-based multi-objective subspace clustering technique is developed in this paper optimizing these validity indices. A new mutation operator, namely duplication and deletion along with the modified version of the exogenous genetic material uptake, are developed to explore the search space effectively. The developed algorithm is tested on sixteen synthetic data sets and seven standard real-life data sets for identifying different subspace clusters. Again, to show the effectiveness of using multiple objectives, the algorithm is also tested on three big data sets and a MNIST data set. Also, an application of the proposed method is shown in biclustering the gene expression data. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared against some state-of-the-art methods. Experimentation reveals that the proposed algorithm can take advantage of its evolvable genomic structure and the newly defined objective functions on the multi objective based framework.

68,Thyroid nodules risk stratification through deep learning based on ultrasound images,47,12,6355-6365,"Bai Ziyu,Chang Luchen,Yu Ruiguo,Li Xuewei,Wei Xi,Yu Mei,Liu Zhiqiang,Gao Jie,Zhu Jialin,Zhang Yulin","Bai ZY,Chang LC,Yu RG,Li XW,Wei X,Yu M,Liu ZQ,Gao J,Zhu JL,Zhang YL",Li XW,10.1002/mp.14543,Tianjin University,"Purpose Clinically, the risk stratification of thyroid nodules is usually used to formulate the next treatment plan. The American College of Radiology (ACR) thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) is a type of medical standard widely used in classification diagnosis. It divides the nodule's ACR TI-RADS level into five levels by quantitative scoring, from benign to high suspicion of malignancy. However, such assessment often relies on the radiologists' experience and is time consuming. So computer-aided diagnosis is necessary. But many deep learning (DL) models are difficult for doctors to understand, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. In this work, we mainly focus on how to achieve automatic thyroid nodules risk stratification based on deep integration of deep learning and clinical experience.
Methods An automatic hierarchical method of thyroid nodules risk based on deep learning is proposed, called risk stratification network (RS-Net). It incorporates medical experience based on ACR TI-RADS. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify the five categories in ACR TI-RADS and assign their points respectively. According to the point totals, the level of risk can be obtained. In addition, a dataset involving 13 984 thyroid ultrasound images is established to develop and evaluate the proposed method.
Results We have extensively compared the results of this paper with the evaluation results of sonographers. The accuracy of the risk stratification (TR1 to TR5) of the proposed method is 65%, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.54. The MAE of the point totals (0 to 13 points) is 1.67. The Pearson's correlation between our method evaluation and doctor evaluation reached 0.84. For the benign and malignant classification, the performance indices accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 88.0%, 98.1%, 79.1%, 80.5%, and 97.9%, respectively. Our method's level of thyroid nodules risk stratification is comparable to that of a senior doctor.
Conclusions This work provides a way to automate the risk stratification of thyroid nodules. Our method can effectively avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis caused by the difference of observers so as to assist doctors to improve efficiency and diagnosis rate. Compared with the previous benign and malignant classification, the proposed method incorporates clinical experience. So it can greatly increase the clinicians' trust in the DL model, thereby improving the applicability of the model in clinical practice.","deep learning,nodules risk stratification,thyroid ultrasound image",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"DIAGNOSIS,CLASSIFICATION,MANAGEMENT,FEATURES",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Despite the importance of its lattice parameters, the experimental determination of these parameters requires special sophisticated equipment, while the first principle calculation consumes appreciable time and might need complex software packages. The existing empirical relation in the literature is characterized by large percentage deviation, and the recently proposed machine learning support vector regression method cannot be empirically implemented on new compounds. This present work fills the research gap through the development of empirical relation between the lattice parameters, electronegativity and ionic radii of the constituting ions using extreme learning machine (ELM) with the grid search (GS) hyper-parameters optimization method. The proposed model is developed through the analysis of atomic structural properties of 85 crystals that serve as representatives of the A(2)XY(6) group. On the basis of a mean absolute percentage error, the developed GS-ELM model outperforms the existing Brik and Kityk [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 72(11), 1256-1260 (2011)] model with a percentage improvement of 58.37%, while it performs better than Alade et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 127(1), 15303 (2020)] model with the percentage enhancement of 37.90%. The outstanding performance of the proposed GS-ELM model coupled with its ease of implementation would be of great significance by enhancing the search for new materials tailored to targeted application and preventing lattice constant mismatch in thin film fabrication.","QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS,OPTIMIZATION,REGRESSION,TEMPERATURE,ALGORITHMS",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS,OPTIMIZATION,REGRESSION,TEMPERATURE,ALGORITHMS",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,,

In the current study, previously unexplored predictive modeling in a key-enabled technology, the laser-based manufacturing, aims to automate and forecast the effect of laser processing on material structures. The focus is centered on the performance of representative statistical and machine learning algorithms in predicting the outcome of laser processing on a range of materials. Results on experimental data showed that predictive models were able to satisfactorily learn the mapping between the laser's input variables and the observed material structure. These results are further integrated with simulation data aiming to elucidate the multiscale physical processes upon laser-material interaction. As a consequence, we augmented the adjusted simulated data to the experiment and substantially improved the predictive performance due to the availability of an increased number of sampling points. In parallel, an information-theoretic metric, which identifies and quantifies the regions with high predictive uncertainty, is presented, revealing that high uncertainty occurs around the transition boundaries. Our results can set the basis for a systematic methodology toward reducing material design, testing, and production cost via the replacement of expensive trial-and-error based manufacturing procedures with a precise pre-fabrication predictive tool.","RIPPLE FORMATION,FEMTOSECOND,SELECTION",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"RIPPLE,FORMATION,FEMTOSECOND,SELECTION",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07686,

In this study, three different machine learning algorithms, namely backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), and general regression neural network, were applied for different countries. Comparative evaluation of these different algorithms based on gross domestic product, domestic material consumption, and resource productivity were given through the optimum solution. Moreover, the algorithms were tested for the case of Turkey. The results of this study are expected to represent a general outline for stakeholders of Turkey for improving MSW management strategies all over the country, and these results can be extended to similar developing countries across the world. It can be concluded that BPNN and SVR methods can be applied successfully for the case of Turkey and other countries across the world to predict the MSW generation, whereas BPNN is slightly better. If the input and output variables are identified well, machine learning approaches can give a good projection for waste generation, and this projection can be utilized for different countries. Furthermore, the developing countries with missing data can develop more realistic strategies for MSW management by not relying solely on international databases such as Eurostat to forecast MSW generation.","artificial neural networks,backpropagation neural network,general regression neural network,support vector regression,waste generation forecasting",Article,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC, 140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA","Engineering,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,2.104,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,NEURAL-NETWORKS,PREDICTION,MANAGEMENT",ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,,

Dual-energy CT (DECT) acquires two spectrally distinct datasets and reconstructs energy-selective (virtual monoenergetic [VM]) and material-selective (material decomposition) images. However, DECT increases system complexity and radiation dose compared with single-spectrum CT. In this paper, a deep learning approach is presented to produce VM images from single-spectrum CT images. Specifically, a modified residual neural network (ResNet) model is developed to map single-spectrum CT images to VM images at pre-specified energy levels. This network is trained on clinical DECT data and shows excellent convergence behavior and image accuracy compared with VM images produced by DECT. The trained model produces high-quality approximations of VM images with a relative error of less than 2%. This method enables multi-material decomposition into three tissue classes, with accuracy comparable with DECT.","DUAL-ENERGY CT,TOMOGRAPHY PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES,LOW-DOSE CT,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS,DECOMPOSITION,NETWORK,USAGE",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,"DUAL-ENERGY,CT,TOMOGRAPHY,PHYSICAL,PRINCIPLES,LOW-DOSE,CT,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,ATTENUATION,COEFFICIENTS,DECOMPOSITION,NETWORK,USAGE",PATTERNS,http://www.cell.com/article/S2666389920301690/pdf,

However, issues regarding long-term stability have emerged as the key bottleneck for commercialization. Here, we develop an automated experimental workflow based on combinatorial synthesis and rapid throughput characterization to explore long-term stability of these materials in ambient conditions. We apply it to four model perovskite systems: MA(x)FA(y)Cs(1-x-)(y)PbBr(3), MA(x)FA(y)Cs(1-x-)(y)PbI(3), Cs(x)FA(y)MA(1-x-y)Pb(Brx+yI1-x-y)(3), and Cs(x)MA(y)FA(1-x-y)Pb(Ix+yBr1-x-y)(3). Non-negative matrix factorization and Gaussian process regression are used to interpolate the photoluminescent behavior of the phase diagram. This interpolative regression analysis helps to distinguish mixtures that form solid solutions from those that segregate into multiple materials, pointing out the most stable regions of the phase diagram.

However, it is limited in determining hemodynamic significance of a stenosis and hence to prove the indication for therapy. Objectives When and how is cCTA used according to current guidelines? Which functional CT techniques are available to test for hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses? Materials and methods The value of cCTA is explained on the basis of current guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for the diagnosis of chronic coronary syndromes. Functional CT techniques which test for hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses are myocardial CT-perfusion (CT-P) and CT-based fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR). Results The new ESC guidelines classify cCTA as a class 1 recommendation for diagnosing coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients with low clinical likelihood. If clinical likelihood is high or an at least moderate stenosis is detected with cCTA, noninvasive functional (stress) imaging is preferred. There is a large body of evidence for CT-P and CT-FFR as functional tests. Conclusion In the current guidelines, cCTA is highly recommended for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The functional CT techniques CT-P and CT-FFR have shown high diagnostic accuracy for myocardial ischemia of coronary stenoses in many clinical studies.
