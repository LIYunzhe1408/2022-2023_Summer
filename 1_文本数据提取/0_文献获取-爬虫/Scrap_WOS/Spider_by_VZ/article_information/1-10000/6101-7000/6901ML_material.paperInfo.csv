In this way, the mining area can be divided into zones with different degrees of risk, and the prevention measures can be taken for the areas predicted to have large deformation. Design/methodology/approach A similar-material model was built by geological and mining conditions of Zhangzhuang Coal Mine. The evolution characteristics of overburden strain were studied by using the distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) technology and the predictive model about overburden deformation was established by applying machine learning. The modeling method of the predictive model based on the similar-material model test was summarized. Finally, this method was applied to engineering. Findings The strain value predicted by the proposed model was compared with the actual measured value and the accuracy is as high as 97%, which proves that it is feasible to combine DOFS technology with machine learning and introduce it into overburden deformation prediction. When this method was applied to engineering, it also showed good performance. Originality/value This paper helps to promote the application of machine learning in the geosciences and mining engineering. It provides a new way to solve similar problems.","Machine learning,Coal seam mining,Distributed optical fiber sensing,Overburden under mining,Strain prediction",Article,"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD, HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematics,Mechanics",,1.442,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,LANDSLIDES,SUSCEPTIBILITY,REGRESSION",ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS,,

This paper presents a two-dimensional Deep Belief Network based on Mixed-restricted Boltzmann Machine capable of receiving multiple two-dimensional inputs. Using multiple inputs provides more appropriate prior information for learning. In this proposed method, the image is transferred to the HSV color space and then the 3D color image is converted to a 2D matrix using a weighted mean. This weighted mean is calculated based on the entropy criterion. The resulting two-dimensional matrix is not in pixel and is merely a raw description of the image. The local, regional and global descriptions are extracted from this matrix and provided for the network. The proposed deep network automatically extracts the appropriate features to determine the progression degree of diabetic retinopathy by the network. Window by window image processing can overcome one of the basic problems of image classification, i.e. the small number of labeled data. Experiments showed that the proposed method is superior when compared to other methods.","Diabetic retinopathy,Mixed-restricted Boltzmann machine,Retinal image,Deep networks,Multi-input 2-dimensional deep belief network",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

By interpolating in the latent space of kirigami structures, the SAE is able to generate designs that mix parallel and orthogonal cuts, despite being trained independently on parallel or orthogonal cuts.

In this work, an interatomic potential is developed for beta-Ga2O3 based on a deep neural network model to predict the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties. Our potential is trained by the ab initio energy surface and atomic forces, which reproduces phonon dispersion in good agreement with first-principles calculations. We are able to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the anisotropic thermal conductivity of beta-Ga2O3 with this potential, and the calculated thermal conductivity values agree well with experimental results from 200 to 500K. Green-Kubo modal analysis is performed to quantify the contributions of different phonon modes to the thermal transport, showing that optical phonon modes play a critical role in the thermal transport. This work provides a high-fidelity machine learning-based potential for MD simulation of beta-Ga2O3 and serves as a good example of exploring thermal transport physics of complex semiconductor materials.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,OXIDE",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,3.596,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,OXIDE",APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0025051,

Most traditional methods focus on extracting features in time domain and frequency domain. The spatial information from adjacent channels and symmetric channels is often ignored. To better learn spatial representation, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end Regional-Asymmetric Convolutional Neural Network (RACNN) for emotion recognition, which consists of temporal, regional and asymmetric feature extractors. Specifically, continuous ID convolution layers are employed in temporal feature extractor to learn time-frequency representations. Then, regional feature extractor consists of two 2D convolution layers to capture regional information among physically adjacent channels. Meanwhile, we propose an Asymmetric Differential Layer (ADL) in asymmetric feature extractor by taking the asymmetry property of emotion responses into account, which can capture the discriminative information between left and right hemispheres of the brain. To evaluate our model, we conduct extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., DEAP and DREAMER. The proposed model can obtain recognition accuracies over 95% for valence and arousal classification tasks on both datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

This is actually the case for determination of carbon in steel with LIBS operated in the ambient gas, where the intense C I 193.090 nm VUV line is absorbed, while the C I 247.856 nm near UV one heavily interferes with iron lines.

Louis","Dadar M,Collins DL",Dadar M,10.1002/mrm.28547,McGill University,"Purpose Tissue segmentation from T-1-weighted (T1W) MRI is a critical requirement in many neuroscience and clinical applications. However, accurate tissue segmentation is challenging because of the variabilities in tissue intensity profiles caused by differences in scanner models, acquisition protocols, and age. In addition, many methods assume healthy anatomy and fail in the presence of pathology such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). We present BISON (Brain tISsue segmentatiON), a new pipeline for tissue segmentation using a random forest classifier and a set of intensity and location priors based on T1W MRI. Methods BISON was developed and cross-validated using multiscanner manual labels of 72 subjects aged 5 to 96 years. We also assessed the test-retest reliability of BISON on two data sets: 20 subjects with scan/rescan MR images and manual segmentations and 90 scans from a single individual. The results were compared against Atropos, a state-of-the-art commonly used tissue classification method from advanced normalization tools (ANTs). Results BISON cross-validation dice kappa values against manual segmentations of 72 MRI volumes yielded kappa(GM)= 0.88, kappa(WM)= 0.85, kappa(CSF)= 0.77, outperforming Atropos (kappa(GM)= 0.79, kappa(WM)= 0.84, kappa(CSF)= 0.64), test-retest values on 20 subjects of kappa(GM)= 0.94, kappa(WM)= 0.92, kappa(CSF)= 0.77 outperforming both manual (kappa(GM)= 0.92, kappa(WM)= 0.91, kappa(CSF)=0.74) and Atropos (kappa(GM)= 0.87, kappa(WM)= 0.92, kappa(CSF)= 0.79). Finally, BISON outperformed Atropos, FAST (fast automated segmentation tool) from the FMRIB (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain) Software Library, and SPM12 (statistical parametric mapping 12) in the presence of WMHs. Conclusion BISON can provide accurate and robust segmentations in data from various age ranges and scanner models, making it ideal for performing tissue classification in large multicenter and multiscanner databases.","automated brain tissue classification,magnetic resonance imaging,random forest classifier",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"WHITE-MATTER,HYPERINTENSITIES,ATLAS-BASED,SEGMENTATION,AUTOMATIC,SEGMENTATION,LESION,SEGMENTATION,MIXTURE,MODEL,MR-IMAGES,VALIDATION,REGISTRATION,SELECTION,ACCURATE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/08/28/747998.full.pdf,

Among many pulmonary nodule detection algorithms,the deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)is the most attractive one. In this kind of networks,the Two-Dimensional(2D)CNNs with many pre-trained models and high detection efficiency are widely used. However,the nature of pulmonary nodules is the Three-Dimensional(3D)lesion,so that the 2D CNNs will inevitably cause information loss and thereby affect the detection accuracy. The 3D CNNs can make full use of the spatial information of CT images and effectively improve the detection accuracy,but the 3D CNNs have shortcomings such as many parameters,large calculation consumption and high risk of over fitting. In order to take the advantages of the two networks,a pulmonary nodule detection model based on a deep mixed CNN was proposed. By deploying 3D CNN in the shallow layer of the neural network model and 2D CNN in the deep layer of the model,and adding a deconvolution module to fuse multi-layer image features together,the model parameters were reduced and the generalization ability and the detection efficiency of the model were improved without decreasing the detection accuracy.

The gait measures were synthesized using a neuromuscular model to estimate internal joint contact force which was the target variable for subject-specific machine learning models (XGBoost) trained based on spectral, temporal, cepstral, and amplitude-based features of the joint acoustic emissions.

Here we show direct quantum transport evidence of Weyl fermions in an epitaxial 4d ferromagnetic oxide SrRuO3. We employ machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize SrRuO3 films whose quality is sufficiently high to probe their intrinsic transport properties. Experimental observation of the five transport signatures of Weyl fermions-the linear positive magnetoresistance, chiral-anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance, phase shift in a quantum oscillation, light cyclotron mass, and high quantum mobility of about 10,000 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)-combined with first-principles electronic structure calculations establishes SrRuO3 as a magnetic Weyl semimetal. We also clarify the disorder dependence of the transport of the Weyl fermions, which gives a clear guideline for accessing the topologically nontrivial transport phenomena.

The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19.

18,Prognostic Implications of Coronary CT Angiography: 2-Year Follow-Up of 6892 Patients,215,4,818-827,"Johnson Kevin M.,Dowe David A.","Johnson KM,Dowe DA",Johnson KM,10.2214/AJR.19.22578,Yale University,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to add to evidence of the long-term prognostic value of coronary cis angiography (CCTA) when combined with nonimaging risk factors and to investigate how CCTA can contribute to the decision to start statin therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients underwent CCM in an outpatient setting for a variety of indications. The National Death Index from February 2004 through December 2018 was queried to identify the outcomes of death due to any cause (all-cause mortality) and death due to coronary artery disease. Framingham and machine learning risk estimation models were constructed. Machine learning inputs were generated from radiologists' descriptions of the findings on structured report forms and not directly from the image pixels. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards were calculated. Clinical benefit was assessed on the basis of the potential impact on assignment of statin therapy.
RESULTS. A total of 6892 outpatients were studied, 4452 (64.6%) of whom were men (mean [+/- SD] age, 51.2 +/- 11.1 years) and 2440 (35.4%) of whom were women (mean age, 573 +/- 12.2 years). The median follow-up was 11.9 years. Among the 6892 patients, 569 deaths (8.3%) were attributed to all-cause mortality, and 94 deaths (1.4%) were due to coronary artery disease. Survival showed strong dependence on the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. For all-cause mortality, the AUC was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86) for the machine learning risk estimation model versus 0.79 (95% CI, 0.78-0.81) for the Framingham risk estimation model (p < 0.001), and for death due to coronary artery disease, the AUC was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) for the machine learning model versus 0.82 (95% CI, 0.77-0.86) for the Framingham model (p = 0.004).

We show how recent progress in ML methods has dramatically extended the applicability range of conventional QM-based simulations, allowing to calculate industrially relevant properties with enhanced accuracy, at reduced computational cost, and for length and time scales that would have otherwise not been accessible. We illustrate the benefits of ML-accelerated atomistic simulations for industrial R&D processes by showcasing relevant applications from two very different areas, drug discovery (pharmaceuticals) and energy materials.

The creep rate in this case exhibits three temporal regimes viz. an initial decelerating regime followed by a steady-state regime and a stage of accelerating creep that ultimately leads to catastrophic breakdown. Due to the statistical regularities in the creep rate, the time evolution of creep rate has often been used to predict residual lifetime until catastrophic breakdown. However, in disordered samples, these efforts met with limited success. Nevertheless, it is clear that as the failure is approached, the damage become increasingly spatially correlated, and the spatio-temporal patterns of acoustic emission, which serve as a proxy for damage accumulation activity, are likely to mirror such correlations. However, due to the high dimensionality of the data and the complex nature of the correlations it is not straightforward to identify the said correlations and thereby the precursory signals of failure. Here we use supervised machine learning to estimate the remaining time to failure of samples of disordered materials. The machine learning algorithm uses as input the temporal signal provided by a mesoscale elastoplastic model for the evolution of creep damage in disordered solids. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited for assessing the proximity to failure from the time series of the acoustic emissions of sheared samples. We show that materials are relatively more predictable for higher disorder while are relatively less predictable for larger system sizes.

In this research, a failure detection method which uses a webcam and deep learning is developed for the ME process. The webcam captures images and then analyzes them by machine learning based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), showing outstanding performance in both image classification and the recognition of objects.

Intracortical microelectrode arrays (MEAs) enable high degree-of-freedom BMI control for complex tasks by providing fine-resolution neural recording. However, chronically implanted MEAs are subject to a dynamicin vivoenvironment where transient or systematic disruptions can interfere with neural recording and degrade BMI performance. Typically, neural implant failure modes have been categorized as biological, material, or mechanical. While this categorization provides insight into a disruption's causal etiology, it is less helpful for understanding degree of impact on BMI function or possible strategies for compensation. Therefore, we propose a complementary classification framework for intracortical recording disruptions that is based on duration of impact on BMI performance and requirement for and responsiveness to interventions: (1)Transient disruptionsinterfere with recordings on the time scale of minutes to hours and can resolve spontaneously; (2)Reversible disruptionscause persistent interference in recordings but the root cause can be remedied by an appropriate intervention; (3)Irreversible compensable disruptionscause persistent or progressive decline in signal quality, but their effects on BMI performance can be mitigated algorithmically; and (4)Irreversible non-compensable disruptionscause permanent signal loss that is not amenable to remediation or compensation. This conceptualization of intracortical BMI disruption types is useful for highlighting specific areas for potential hardware improvements and also identifying opportunities for algorithmic interventions. We review recording disruptions that have been reported for MEAs and demonstrate how biological, material, and mechanical mechanisms of disruption can be further categorized according to their impact on signal characteristics. Then we discuss potential compensatory protocols for each of the proposed disruption classes. Specifically, transient disruptions may be minimized by using robust neural decoder features, data augmentation methods, adaptive machine learning models, and specialized signal referencing techniques. Statistical Process Control methods can identify reparable disruptions for rapid intervention.In-vivodiagnostics such as impedance spectroscopy can inform neural feature selection and decoding models to compensate for irreversible disruptions. Additional compensatory strategies for irreversible disruptions include information salvage techniques, data augmentation during decoder training, and adaptive decoding methods to down-weight damaged channels.","microelectrode failure,biocompatibility,recording disruptions,neuroprosthetics,brain-computer interface,intracortical electrode array,signal quality",Review,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Robotics,Neurosciences & Neurology",,3.272,"COMPUTER,INTERFACES,MOTOR,CORTEX,MICROELECTRODE,ARRAYS,NEURONAL,ENSEMBLE,NEURAL,ELECTRODES,TISSUE,RESPONSES,SILICON,RECORDINGS,IMPACT,STABILITY",FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7581895,

Accurate and quantitative follow-up of OPG using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for therapeutic decision making, yet is challenging due to the complex shape and heterogeneous tissue pattern which characterizes these tumors. The aim of this study was to implement automatic methods for segmentation and classification of OPG and its components, based on MRI. Methods A total of 202 MRI scans from 29 patients with chiasmatic OPG scanned longitudinally were retrospectively collected and included in this study. Data included T(2)and post-contrast T(1)weighted images. The entire tumor volume and its components were manually annotated by a senior neuro-radiologist, and inter- and intra-rater variability of the entire tumor volume was assessed in a subset of scans. Automatic tumor segmentation was performed using deep-learning method with U-Net+ResNet architecture. A fivefold cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the automatic results relative to manual segmentation. Voxel-based classification of the tumor into enhanced, non-enhanced, and cystic components was performed using fuzzy c-means clustering. Results The results of the automatic tumor segmentation were: mean dice score = 0.736 +/- 0.025, precision = 0.918 +/- 0.014, and recall = 0.635 +/- 0.039 for the validation data, and dice score = 0.761 +/- 0.011, precision = 0.794 +/- 0.028, and recall = 0.742 +/- 0.012 for the test data.

Therefore, computational methodologies have become critical in the study of the processes that occur in these domains. Until recently, these methodologies have fallen into two broad categories: quantum mechanics (QM) based methods and semiempirical/classical methods.

Through systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning algorithms, we present a rational design guidance for the feasibility of transition metal SA formation on a defective carbon surface and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the resulting SAs. We show that the dispersion of a metal nanoparticle (NP) into a stable array of SAs on a defective carbon surface is governed by the decomposition energy barrier of the NP and the diffusion barrier of SAs on a carbon surface. An intrinsic descriptor that correlates the catalytic activity of a SAC with the topological, bonding, and electronic structures of the SAC and its bonding carbon defect site is revealed. The few-shot machine learning algorithm further enables a 130 000-fold reduction of the time needed to calculate the ORR activity of SACs from DFT, and thus allows us to predict the ORR activity of SACs of all transition metals within an error of 8.33%.

However, many applications are limited by their mechanical properties, and a fundamental understanding of NPs' effect on the nonlinear mechanical properties is lacking. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of NPs on the tendency of a polymer nanopillar to form a shear band. Even though we restrict ourselves to sufficiently low NP loadings that the elastic and yield behaviors are unaffected compared to the pure polymer, the polymer-NP interactions have a surprisingly strong effect on the location of a shear band in the sample. Different polymer-NP interactions have been used to explore their effect on the local structure of materials which is described using a recently developed machine-learned quantity, softness. Our calculations reveal a strong correlation between the strain localization pattern and the local structural signatures. Lastly, we show that weak interactions between NP and polymer matrix can form a soft region near the NP, and this leads to an attraction of the shear band to the NP surface.","SHEAR BANDS,DYNAMICS,DEFORMATION,NANOCOMPOSITES,COMPOSITES,RELAXATION,FAILURE",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Physics,Polymer Science",,3.705,"SHEAR,BANDS,DYNAMICS,DEFORMATION,NANOCOMPOSITES,COMPOSITES,RELAXATION,FAILURE",SOFT MATTER,,

By adopting methods to effectively discover and implicitly transfer useful genetic materials from one task to another, it can process multiple optimization tasks simultaneously using one evolutionary calculation. Inspired by the idea of evolutionary multitasking, it can be also used in optimization problems of fuzzy systems (FSs). By exchanging optimization experience and knowledge between different FSs, it is expected to enhance the speed and efficiency of FS optimization and be applied to FS optimization tasks with higher requirement for running time and accuracy of results. Moreover, using the experience and knowledge of simple FSs optimization tasks to facilitate the optimization of complex FSs, it can resolve high time consuming and high cost that triggered by large, complex FSs optimization problems and improve the feasibility of its application in large complex fuzzy control optimization problems. Different from the general multi-task learning, the multi-task learning of FS optimization has its own features.

Child death is a crucial concern that needs to concentrate on ""save the children."" Abnormality of a child can be obtained by diagnosing the prenatal by ultrasound system within a specific period for providing better treatment to do ""save the children."". This article aimed to diagnose the (prenatal) ultrasound-images by design and implement a novel framework named Defending Against Child Death (DACD). The existing method is a semiautomatic method where it used convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for classifying ultrasound images. Real-time medical industry requires a fully automatic method for classifying the ultrasound images to save the human. Hence this article, includes deep learning by implementing five convolutional neural network architectures in an order where it learns, estimate, and confirms the fetus parameters. All the layers in the convolutional neural network extract and classify the different number of features in the ultrasound images automatically and provide a result. The increased number of hidden layers in the CNN can extract even the hidden features of the images. The extracted features are classified automatically and improve the accuracy of disease detection. To segment the fetus abdomen, U-Net architecture is included in the CNN with Hough transformation. The experiment is carried out using the CNN toolbox in MATLAB and the outcomes are verified. The performance of the DACD is assessed by comparing the results with the earlier researches. From the experimental results, it is obtained that the accuracy of DACD is 99.7%, which is higher than the results obtained from the existing machine learning approach.","convolutional neural network,deep learning,Down syndrome analysis,fetus diagnosis,nuchal translucency",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Computer Science,,2.016,"FETAL,ULTRASOUND,PERFORMANCE,WEIGHT",COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,,

Fast and accurate registration between the on-treatment CBCT and planning CT is significant for and precise adaptive radiotherapy treatment (ART). However, existing CT-CBCT registration methods, which are mostly affine or time-consuming intensity- based deformation registration, still need further study due to the considerable CT-CBCT intensity discrepancy and the artifacts in low-quality CBCT images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based CT-CBCT registration model to promote rapid and accurate CT-CBCT registration for radiotherapy. Methods The proposed CT-CBCT registration model consists of a registration network and an innovative deep similarity metric network. The registration network is a novel fully convolution network adapted specially for patch-wise CT-CBCT registration. The metric network, going beyond intensity, automatically evaluates the high-dimensional attribute-based dissimilarity between the registered CT and CBCT images. In addition, considering the artifacts in low-quality CBCT images, we add spatial weighting (SW) block to adaptively attach more importance to those informative voxels while inhibit the interference of artifact regions. Such SW-based metric network is expected to extract the most meaningful and discriminative deep features, and form a more reliable CT-CBCT similarity measure to train the registration network. Results We evaluate the proposed method on clinical thoracic CBCT and CT dataset, and compare the registration results with some other common image similarity metrics and some state-of-the-art registration algorithms. The proposed method provides the highest Structural Similarity index (86.17 +/- 5.09), minimum Target Registration Error of landmarks (2.37 +/- 0.32 mm), and the best DSC coefficient (78.71 +/- 10.95) of tumor volumes. Moreover, our model also obtains comparable distance error of lung surfaces (1.75 +/- 0.35 mm). Conclusion The proposed model shows both efficiency and efficacy for reliable thoracic CT-CBCT registration, and can generate the matched CT and CBCT images within few seconds, which is of great significance to clinical radiotherapy.","adversarial training,CT-CBCT registration,deep network,perceptual loss,unsupervised model",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"IMAGE,REGISTRATION,PLANNING,CT,CONTOUR,PROPAGATION,FIDUCIAL,MARKERS,CANCER,FUSION,HEAD",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

How to control it remains one of the most intriguing questions in material physics/chemistry, especially in two-dimensional layered materials. In this work, we report realization of SMT in MoS2xOx bilayers, driven by the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the van der Waals (vdW) gap of the disordered bilayers. Using the cluster expansion method, we determined that either semiconducting (stable) or metallic states (metastable) can be realized in MoS2xOx bilayers with the same composition. Machine learning analysis revealed that the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the vdW gap is the leading fingerprint of SMT, with structural distortion induced by atom mixing being a significant secondary factor. The electronic origin of the SMT is the broadening of the Mo dz(2) and O p(z) bands, accompanied by the redistribution of the d electrons. This in-vdW-gap composition-gradient-driven SMT phenomenon also applies to MoSe2xOx and MoTe2xOx bilayers. The present work provides an alternative mechanism of SMT and demonstrates that the composition gradient across the vdW gap in the bilayer materials can be another degree of freedom to tune the band gaps without introducing extrinsic elements. Our findings will benefit the material design for small-scale and energy-efficient electronic devices.","semiconductor-metal transition,composition,gradient,MoS2-xOx bilayer,density functional theory,machine learning",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"PHASE-TRANSITION,INSULATOR-TRANSITION,ATOMIC,MECHANISM,VANADIUM,DIOXIDE,MOS2,DYNAMICS,NICKEL,FILMS,OXIDE",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,,

We trained a model to learn principles governing BOLD activity in one dataset and reconstruct artificially compromised regions in an independent dataset, frame by frame. Intriguingly, BOLD time series extracted from reconstructed frames are correlated with the original time series, even though the frames do not independently carry any temporal information. Moreover, reconstructed functional connectivity maps exhibit good correspondence with the original connectivity maps, indicating that the model recovers functional relationships among brain regions. We replicated this result in two healthy datasets and in patients whose scans suffered signal loss due to intracortical electrodes. Critically, the reconstructions capture individual-specific information. Deep machine learning thus presents a unique opportunity to reconstruct compromised BOLD signal while capturing features of an individual's own functional brain organization.","HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT,BRAIN-STIMULATION,NETWORKS,OPTIMIZATION,ORGANIZATION,ACCURATE,ROBUST,MRI",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"HUMAN,CONNECTOME,PROJECT,BRAIN-STIMULATION,NETWORKS,OPTIMIZATION,ORGANIZATION,ACCURATE,ROBUST,MRI",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/287712/1/PMC7542429.pdf,

Viscarra","Behrens T,Rossel RAV",Behrens T,10.1038/s41598-020-73773-y,Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Two important theories in spatial modelling relate to structural and spatial dependence. Structural dependence refers to environmental state-factor models, where an environmental property is modelled as a function of the states and interactions of environmental predictors, such as climate, parent material or relief. Commonly, the functions are regression or supervised classification algorithms. Spatial dependence is present in most environmental properties and forms the basis for spatial interpolation and geostatistics. In machine learning, modelling with geographic coordinates or Euclidean distance fields, which resemble linear variograms with infinite ranges, can produce similar interpolations. Interpolations do not lend themselves to causal interpretations. Conversely, with structural modeling, one can, potentially, extract knowledge from the modelling. Two important characteristics of such interpretable environmental modelling are scale and information content. Scale is relevant because very coarse scale predictors can show nearly infinite ranges, falling out of what we call the information horizon, i.e. interpretation using domain knowledge isn't possible. Regarding information content, recent studies have shown that meaningless predictors, such as paintings or photographs of faces, can be used for spatial environmental modelling of ecological and soil properties, with accurate evaluation statistics. Here, we examine under which conditions modelling with such predictors can lead to accurate statistics and whether an information horizon can be derived for scale and information content.","CROSS-VALIDATION,FIELDS",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"CROSS-VALIDATION,FIELDS",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7542468,

However, as is typical in materials discovery, they represent only a small fraction of possible intermetallic compounds. To address this problem of unbalanced data sets, a machine-learning model was developed using an ensemble approach involving the synthetic minority oversampling technique to predict new compounds likely to adopt half-Heusler structures. The training set was based on experimental crystal structures, including those of nonstoichiometric compounds. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the validation set and gave excellent performance in terms of balanced statistical measures. A subset of compounds predicted to adopt half-Heusler structures having existing full-Heusler counterparts was then targeted for preparation.

Here, we test different microstructure representations and evaluate model performance based on the F1 score. A F1 score of 95.1% was achieved for distinguishing between micrographs corresponding to ten different thermo-mechanical material processing conditions. We find that our newly developed microstructure representation describes image data well, and the traditional approach of utilizing area fractions of different phases is insufficient for distinguishing between multiple classes using a relatively small, imbalanced original dataset of 272 images. To explore the applicability of generative methods for supplementing such limited datasets, generative adversarial networks were trained to generate artificial microstructure images. Two different generative networks were trained and tested to assess performance. Challenges and best practices associated with applying machine learning to limited microstructure image datasets are also discussed.

In addition, body truncation occurs in MR imaging for large patients who exceed the transaxial field-of-view of the scanner. Body truncation and metal artefacts translate to incomplete MRI-derived attenuation correction (AC) maps, consequently resulting in large quantification errors in PET imaging. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to predict the missing information/regions in MR images affected by metallic artefacts and/or body truncation aiming at reducing quantification errors in PET/MRI. Twenty-five whole-body (WB) co-registered PET, CT, and MR images were used for training and evaluation of the object completion approach. CT-based attenuation corrected PET images were considered as reference for the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach. Its performance was compared to the 3-class segmentation-based AC approach (containing background air, soft-tissue and lung) obtained from MR images. The metal-induced artefacts affected 8.1 +/- 1.8% of the volume of the head region when using the 3-class AC maps. This error reduced to 0.9 +/- 0.5% after application of object completion on MR images. Consequently, quantification errors in PET images reduced from -57.5 +/- 11% to -18.5 +/- 5% in the head region after metal artefact correction. The percentage of the torso volume affected by body truncation in the 3-class AC maps reduced from 9.8 +/- 1.9% to 0.6 +/- 0.3% after truncation compensation. PET quantification errors in the affected regions were also reduced from -45.5 +/- 10% to -9.5 +/- 3% after truncation compensation.

Baseline weight of 388 patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was measured between one month prior to and one week after the start of IMRT. Weight change between one week and two months after the commencement of IMRT was analyzed, and dichotomized at 5% WL. Each patient had a planning CT and contours of gross tumor volume (GTV) and esophagus (ESO). A total of 355 features including clinical parameter (CP), GTV and ESO (GTV&ESO) dose-volume histogram (DVH), GTV radiomics, and GTV&ESO dosiomics features were extracted. R&D features were categorized as first- (L1), second- (L2), higher-order (L3) statistics, and three combined groups, L1 + L2, L2 + L3 and L1 + L2 + L3. Multi-view texture analysis was performed to identify optimal R&D input features. In the training set (194 earlier patients), feature selection was performed using Boruta algorithm followed by collinearity removal based on variance inflation factor. Machine-learning models were developed using Laplacian kernel support vector machine (lpSVM), deep neural network (DNN) and their averaged ensemble classifiers. Prediction performance was tested on an independent test set (194 more recent patients), and compared among seven different input conditions: CP-only, DVH-only, R&D-only, DVH + CP, R&D + CP, R&D + DVH and R&D + DVH + CP. Combined GTV L1 + L2 + L3 radiomics and GTV&ESO L3 dosiomics were identified as optimal input features, which achieved the best performance with an ensemble classifier (AUC = 0.710), having statistically significantly higher predictability compared with DVH and/or CP features (p < 0.05). When this performance was compared to that with full R&D-only features which reflect traditional single-view data, there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Using optimized multi-view R&D input features is beneficial for predicting early WL in lung cancer radiotherapy, leading to improved performance compared to using conventional DVH and/or CP features.","machine learning,radiomics,dosiomics,lung cancer,weight loss,radiotherapy,IMRT",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"RADIATION-THERAPY,TEXTURAL,FEATURES,FEATURE-SELECTION,MODELS,CHEMOTHERAPY,AGREEMENT,SYSTEM,BORUTA,CT",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

The electromechanical response depends on the grain and grain boundaries which can be probed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In this study, we have modeled the impedance spectra from buckled and free standing gadolinia doped ceria (Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9) membrane in Al/Ti/Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9/Ti/Al electromechanical device, at different AC excitation voltages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 V), and starting from room temperature to 100 degrees C. The analysis of impedance spectrum is commonly done by equivalent circuit modeling to obtain the resistors (R) and capacitors (C). However, to overcome the inherent problems like non-uniqueness, over fitting, presently different approaches have been chosen such as impedance spectroscopy genetic programming (ISGP) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). ISGP finds an analytic form of the distribution function of relaxation times (DFRTs) using impedance spectra. The DFRT analysis reveals that the grain boundary capacitance for the membrane similar to 10(-8)-10(-9) F decreases with increasing temperature and excitation voltages. Besides, neural networks, which are optimized by Bayesian regularization, simulate both the real and imaginary parts of impedance following the pattern of experimental data up to several Hz. The DFRT analysis on this simulated impedance data shows an effect of grain boundaries. Indeed, ANNs as optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt method, can estimate the R and C's for present system with maximum relative errors of 24% and 22%, respectively.","ceramic actuators,Gd doed ceria,impedance spectroscopy,genetic algorithm,distribution function of relaxation times,neural network",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Physics,,3.041,"GRAIN-BOUNDARY,CONDUCTIVITY,GD,ELECTROSTRICTION,SPECTROSCOPY,STATE,SUPERCAPACITORS,MICROSTRUCTURE,PERFORMANCE,DFRT",JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS,,

This ensemble model is built using four machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, and Neural Network. We validate MRPMC in an internal validation cohort and two external validation cohorts, where it achieves an AUC of 0.9621 (95% CI: 0.9464-0.9778), 0.9760 (0.9613-0.9906), and 0.9246 (0.8763-0.9729), respectively. This model enables expeditious and accurate mortality risk stratification of patients with COVID-19, and potentially facilitates more responsive health systems that are conducive to high risk COVID-19 patients. Methods to stratify patients according to mortality risk are essential to allocate limited heath resources during the COVID-19 crisis. Here, using machine learning methods, the authors present a mortality risk prediction model for COVID-19 that uses patients' clinical data on admission to stratify patients by mortality risk.","CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS,MULTICENTER,CANCER,CHINA",Article,"NATURE PORTFOLIO, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"CLINICAL,CHARACTERISTICS,MULTICENTER,CANCER,CHINA",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18684-2.pdf,

Unfortunately, these calculations do not provide good physical insights into why those features occur. Here, we present a fast interatomic potential, which reproduces the molecular hydrogen phases: orientationally disordered Phase I; broken-symmetry Phase II and reentrant melt curve. The H-2 vibrational frequency drops at high pressure because of increased coupling between neighbouring molecules, not bond weakening. Liquid H-2 is denser than coexisting close-packed solid at high pressure because the favored molecular orientation switches from quadrupole-energy-minimizing to steric-repulsion-minimizing. The latter allows molecules to get closer together, without the atoms getting closer, but cannot be achieved within in a close-packed layer due to frustration. A similar effect causes negative thermal expansion. At high pressure, rotation is hindered in Phase I, such that it cannot be regarded as a molecular rotor phase. Hydrogen has multiple molecular phases which are challenging to explore computationally. The authors develop a machine-learning approach, learning from reference ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, to derive a transferable hierarchical force model that provides insight into high pressure phases and the melting line of H-2.","SOLID HYDROGEN,PHASE-TRANSITION,DEUTERIUM,DYNAMICS",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"SOLID,HYDROGEN,PHASE-TRANSITION,DEUTERIUM,DYNAMICS",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538439,

One of the significant challenges in this crisis is to identify and monitor the COVID-19 patients quickly and efficiently to facilitate timely decisions for their treatment, monitoring, and management. Research efforts are on to develop less time-consuming methods to replace or to supplement RT-PCR-based methods. The present study is aimed at creating efficient deep learning models, trained with chest X-ray images, for rapid screening of COVID-19 patients. We used publicly available PA chest X-ray images of adult COVID-19 patients for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classification models for COVID-19 and other major infectious diseases. To increase the dataset size and develop generalized models, we performed 25 different types of augmentations on the original images. Furthermore, we utilized the transfer learning approach for the training and testing of the classification models. The combination of two best-performing models (each trained on 286 images, rotated through 120 degrees or 140 degrees angle) displayed the highest prediction accuracy for normal, COVID-19, non-COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis images. AI-based classification models trained through the transfer learning approach can efficiently classify the chest X-ray images representing studied diseases. Our method is more efficient than previously published methods. It is one step ahead towards the implementation of AI-based methods for classification problems in biomedical imaging related to COVID-19.","DEEP,AUGMENTATION,HEALTH",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,"DEEP,AUGMENTATION,HEALTH",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539085,

Reviewing hundreds of slices produced by ABUS is time-consuming. In this paper, a tumor detection method for ABUS image based on convolutional neural network is proposed. Methods First, integrating multitask learning with YOLOv3, an improved YOLOv3 detection network is designed to detect tumor candidate in two-dimensional (2D) slices. Two-dimensional detection separately treats each slice, leading to larger differences of position and score for tumor candidate in adjacent slices. Due to the influence of artifact, noise, and mammary tissues, 2D detection may include many false positive regions. To alleviate these problems, a rescoring processing algorithm is first designed. Then three-dimensional volume forming and FP reduction scheme are built. Results This method was tested on 340 volumes (124 patients, 181 tumors) with fivefold cross validation. It achieved sensitivities of 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, and 70% at 7.42, 3.31, 1.62, 1.23, and 0.88 false positives per volume.

Medical ultrasound imaging is one of the widely applied breast imaging methods for breast tumors. Automatic breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation can measure the size of tumors objectively. However, various ultrasound artifacts hinder segmentation. We proposed an attention-supervised full-resolution residual network (ASFRRN) to segment tumors from BUS images. Methods In the proposed method, Global Attention Upsample (GAU) and deep supervision were introduced into a full-resolution residual network (FRRN), where GAU learns to merge features at different levels with attention for deep supervision. Two datasets were employed for evaluation. One (Dataset A) consisted of 163 BUS images with tumors (53 malignant and 110 benign) from UDIAT Centre Diagnostic, and the other (Dataset B) included 980 BUS images with tumors (595 malignant and 385 benign) from the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The tumors from both datasets were manually segmented by medical doctors. For evaluation, the Dice coefficient (Dice), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), and F1 score were calculated. Results For Dataset A, the proposed method achieved higher Dice (84.3 +/- 10.0%), JSC (75.2 +/- 10.7%), and F1 score (84.3 +/- 10.0%) than the previous best method: FRRN. For Dataset B, the proposed method also achieved higher Dice (90.7 +/- 13.0%), JSC (83.7 +/- 14.8%), and F1 score (90.7 +/- 13.0%) than the previous best methods: DeepLabv3 and dual attention network (DANet). For Dataset A + B, the proposed method achieved higher Dice (90.5 +/- 13.1%), JSC (83.3 +/- 14.8%), and F1 score (90.5 +/- 13.1%) than the previous best method: DeepLabv3. Additionally, the parameter number of ASFRRN was only 10.6 M, which is less than those of DANet (71.4 M) and DeepLabv3 (41.3 M). Conclusions We proposed ASFRRN, which combined with FRRN, attention mechanism, and deep supervision to segment tumors from BUS images. It achieved high segmentation accuracy with a reduced parameter number.","breast cancer,breast ultrasound image,deep learning,segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"GRAPH-BASED,SEGMENTATION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905659,

It can lead to pain, discomfort, disfigurement, and even death in some cases. Dental caries is caused by the infection of the calcified tissue of the teeth. They can be prevented easily by early diagnosis and treated in the early stages. The development of a reliable model for the diagnosis and classification of dental caries can lead to effective and timely treatment. The G.V Black Classification system of dental caries is one of the systems which is widely accepted worldwide. It classifies caries into six classes based on the location of caries. This paper proposes a novel deep convolution layer network (CNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for the detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical dental images. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional neural network for extracting the features and Long Short term memory (LSTM) for conducting short-term and long-term dependencies. The main objective of this study is to detect dental caries and classify them into various classes based on G.V Black Classification. The periapical dental images are pre-processed and are fed as input to deep convolutional neural networks. The deep convolutional neural network classifies the input into various classes. The proposed algorithm is optimized using the Dragonfly optimization algorithm and gave an accuracy of 96%. Experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the proposed model with the recent state-of-art deep learning models. This study justifies that a deep convolutional neural network is one of the most efficient ways to detect and classify dental caries into various G.V black classes. The achieved accuracy of the proposed optimal CNN-LSTM model for G.V black classification proves its efficacy as compared to the classification accuracy achieved by widely used pre-trained CNN models i.e. Alexnet (accuracy: 93%) and GoogleNet (accuracy: 94%) on the same database. The performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model is further strengthened by comparing the results with the CNN model, 2 layer LSTM model and CNN-LSTM model without dragonfly optimization. The proposed optimal CNN-LSTM model shows the best performance with 96% accuracy and helps in dental image classification as the second opinion to the medical expert.","G,V black Classification,Convolution neural network,Long short-term memory model,Dental caries",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, 1.396 lung CT images in total (386 Covid-19 and 1.010 Non-Covid-19) were subjected to automatic classification. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of the deep learning methods, was used which suggested automatic classification of CT images of lungs for early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. In addition, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to compare the classification successes of deep learning with machine learning. Within the scope of the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture was designed and used as a classifier. Also, training and testing processes were performed for Alexnet and Mobilenetv2 CNN architectures as well. The classification results were also calculated for the case of increasing the number of images used in training for the first 23-layer CNN architecture by 5, 10, and 20 times using data augmentation methods. To reveal the effect of the change in the number of images in the training and test clusters on the results, two different training and testing processes, 2-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, were performed and the results of the study were calculated. As a result, thanks to these detailed calculations performed within the scope of the study, a comprehensive comparison of the success of the texture analysis method, machine learning, and deep learning methods in Covid-19 classification from CT images was made.

Through first-principles calculations, finite-element simulations validated by experiments, and neural network learning, we show here that metallization/demetallization as well as indirect-to-direct bandgap transitions can be achieved reversibly in diamond below threshold strain levels for phonon instability. We identify the pathway to metallization within six-dimensional strain space for different sample geometries. We also explore phonon-instability conditions that promote phase transition to graphite.

Materials and Methods In total, 44 AIS patients (female/male: 34/10; PJK/non-PJK: 34/10) who met the inclusion criteria between January 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively recruited from West China Hospital. Thirty-seven clinical and radiological features were acquired by two independent investigators. Univariate analyses between PJK and non-PJK groups were carried out. Twelve models were built by using four types of machine learning algorithms in conjunction with two oversampling methods [the synthetic minority technique (SMOTE) and random oversampling]. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model discrimination, and the clinical utility was evaluated by using F1 score and accuracy. The risk factors were simultaneously analyzed by a Cox regression and machine learning. Results Statistical differences between PJK and non-PJK groups were as follows: gender (p= 0.001), preoperative factors [thoracic kyphosis (p= 0.03), T1 slope angle (T1S,p= 0.078)], and postoperative factors [T1S (p= 0.097), proximal junctional angle (p= 0.003), upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) - UIV + 1 (p= 0.001)]. Random forest using SMOTE achieved the best prediction performance with AUC = 0.944, accuracy = 0.909, and F1 score = 0.667 on independent testing dataset. Cox model revealed that male gender and larger preoperative T1S were independent prognostic factors of PJK (odds ratio = 10.701 and 57.074, respectively). Gender was also at the first place in the importance ranking of the model with best performance. Conclusion The random forest using SMOTE model has the great value for predicting the individual risk of developing PJK after long instrumentation and fusion surgery in Lenke 5 AIS patients. Moreover, the combination of the outcomes of a Cox model and the feature ranking extracted by machine learning is more valuable than any one alone, especially in the interpretation of risk factors.","spinal deformity,proximal junctional kyphosis,sagittal malalignment,machine learning,prediction model",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"ADULT,SPINAL,DEFORMITY,RISK-FACTORS,INSTRUMENTATION,FUSION,CONSTRUCTS,OUTCOMES,IMPACT,CANCER",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573316,

Materials and Methods Data was collected in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cardiac ICU, Progressive Care Unit, and Operating Suites in a large academic children's hospital. Ninety-nine children and 30 adults were enrolled in testing and validation cohorts, respectively. Patients had 5 paired CRT measurements by a modified pulse oximeter device and a clinician, generating 485 waveform pairs for model training. Supervised ML models using gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVMs) were developed to detect flash (<1 s) or prolonged CRT (>= 2 s) using clinician CRT assessment as the reference standard.

Methods PD patient data from the Parkinson's Progress Markers Initiative (PPMI) database was evaluated. Seventy-two PD patients with disease progression, as measured by the Hoehn-Yahr Scale (HYS) (stage 1-5), and 72 PD patients with stable PD were matched by sex, age, and category of HYS and included in the current study. Each individual's T-1-weighted MRI scans at the baseline timepoint were segmented to isolate whole-brain white matter for radiomics feature extraction. The total dataset was divided into a training and test set according to subject serial number. The size of the training dataset was reduced using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm to construct a radiomics signature using machine learning. Finally, a joint model was constructed by incorporating the radiomics signature and clinical progression scores. The test data were then used to validate the prediction models, which were evaluated based on discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Results Based on the overall data, the areas under curve (AUCs) of the joint model, signature and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III PD rating score were 0.836, 0.795, and 0.550, respectively.

The similarity matrix of feature distances is calculated to measure the difference between background noise and retinal objects. Moreover, a feature-transfer network is proposed to detect MAs with imbalanced data. For each training process, the optimized weights and bias are transferred to the next training, until the optimal network is generated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately detect subtle MAs surrounded by complex background.

Objective As OUD-specific AI interventions are relatively recent, dynamic, and may not yet be captured in the peer-reviewed literature, we conducted a review of the gray literature to identify literature pertaining to OUD-specific AI interventions being developed, implemented and evaluated. Methods Gray literature databases, customized Google searches, and targeted websites were searched from January 2013 to October 2019. Search terms include: AI, machine learning, substance use disorder (SUD), and OUD. We also requested recommendations for relevant material from experts in this area. Results This review yielded a total of 70 unique citations and 29 unique interventions, which can be sub-divided into five categories: smartphone applications (n = 12); healthcare data-related interventions (n = 7); biosensor-related interventions (n = 5); digital and virtual-related interventions (n = 2); and 'other', i.e., those that cannot be classified in these categories (n = 3). While the majority have not undergone rigorous scientific evaluation via randomized controlled trials, several AI interventions showed promise in aiding the identification of escalating opioid use patterns, informing the treatment of OUD, and detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression.

However, the diabetic retinopathy is hard to be detected in the initial stages, and the procedure of diagnostic can be time-consuming even for experienced-experts. The segment based learning approach has shown the benefits over learning technique for detection of diabetic retinopathy: only the annotation of image level is required get the lesions and detection of diabetic retinopathy. Anyways, the performance of existing methods are limited by the utilization of handcrafted features. This paper proposes the segment based learning approach for detection of diabetic retinopathy, which mutually learns classifiers and features from the data and gets significant development on recognizing the images of diabetic retinopathy and their inside the lesions. Specifically, the pre-trained CNN is adapted to get the segment level DRE (Diabetic retinopathy Estimation) and then Integrating all segment level of (DRM) is utilized to make the classification of diabetic retinopathy images.

This is because medical practitioners still rely on visual observations in the analysis of the results of Pap smear so that the results are subjective. Therefore, we need a programme that can help the classification process in establishing a diagnosis of cervical cancer with high accuracy results.

SBCE can play an additional role in differentiating between CD and SNVA. De-identified SBCEs of patients with CD and SNVA were included. Probabilistic analysis of features on SBCE were used to predict severity of duodenal histology and to distinguish between CD and SNVA. Patients with higher Marsh scores were more likely to have a positive SBCE and a continuous distribution of macroscopic features of disease than those with lower Marsh scores. The same pattern was also true for patients with CD when compared to patients with SNVA. The validation accuracy when predicting the severity of Marsh scores and when distinguishing between CD and SNVA was 69.1% in both cases. When the proportions of each SBCE class group within the dataset were included in the classification model, to distinguish between the two pathologies, the validation accuracy increased to 75.3%.

Oxygen octahedral rotation forms a fundamental atomic distortion in perovskite oxides, but only a few patterns are predominantly present at equilibrium. This has restricted the range of possible properties and functions of perovskite oxides, necessitating the utilization of nonequilibrium patterns of octahedral rotation. Here, we report that a designed metastable pattern of octahedral rotation leads to robust room-temperature ferroelectricity in CaTiO3, which is otherwise nonpolar down to 0K. Guided by density-functional theory, we selectively stabilize the metastable pattern, distinct from the equilibrium pattern and cooperative with ferroelectricity, in heteroepitaxial films of CaTiO3. Atomic-scale imaging combined with deep neural network analysis confirms a close correlation between the metastable pattern and ferroelectricity. This work reveals a hidden but functional pattern of oxygen octahedral rotation and opens avenues for designing multifunctional materials. Previous studies are limited to modulate oxygen octahedral rotation angles within the same pattern, and engineering the pattern remains a challenge.

However, due to the irregular shapes of nodules, and the low-intensity contrast between the nodules and other lung areas, precisely segmenting nodules from lung CT images is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a highly effective and robust solution to this problem by innovatively utilizing the changes of nodule shapes over continuous slices (inter-slice changes) and develop a deep learning based end-to-end system. Different from the existing 2.5D or 3D methods that attempt to explore the inter-slice features, we propose to create a novel synthetic image to depict the unique changing pattern of nodules between slices in distinctive colour patterns. Based on the new synthetic images, we then adopt the deep learning based image segmentation techniques and develop a modified U-Net architecture to learn the unique color patterns formed by nodules. With our proposed approach, the detection and segmentation of nodules can be achieved simultaneously with an accuracy significantly higher than the state of the arts by 10% without introducing high computation cost.

Over the past few decades, many candidate materials (e.g., metals and their oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides) in various 2D and 3D architectures and structures (e.g., layered double hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, rutiles, spinels, and perovskites) have been evaluated for catalyzing the two half-reactions involved in water splitting: hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Moreover, these materials are used under varied operating conditions, such as low and high temperatures, pressures, and solution pH, and in the presence or absence of sunlight. Accordingly, it is valuable to examine why the materials and process conditions currently in use were explored in the first place and why some of them are more promising than others. Given the difficulties associated with experimentally characterizing electrode-electrolyte interfaces in situ, theory can be a valuable partner for gaining insight into intermediate structures, reaction mechanisms, and ultimately catalyst design. Here, we focus on how theoretical studies of crucial materials properties, such as optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, band edge positions, and the kinetics of charge-carrier separation and transport), adsorption and reaction energetics, and (photo)electrochemical stability, inform the success of existing and yet-to-be-discovered (photo)electrocatalysts. We also highlight other research directions important for theoretical (photo)electrocatalyst discovery, such as the quantification of reaction kinetics versus thermodynamics, investigation of the influence of defects and surface reconstructions on (photo)electrocatalytic materials properties, and the use of data science strategies (e.g., high-throughput simulations, statistical regression, and machine learning) to accelerate the development of new materials for water splitting applications.","oxygen evolution reaction,hydrogen evolution reaction,photoelectrocatalysis,electrocatalysis,water splitting,materials discovery,electrolyzers,solar fuels,renewable energy",Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,13.721,"OXYGEN,EVOLUTION,REACTION,SOLAR,HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION,2ND-ORDER,PERTURBATION-THEORY,TRANSITION-METAL,OXIDES,FREE-ENERGY,BARRIERS,SPACE,SCF,METHOD,DFT,PLUS,U,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,BETA-NIOOH,REACTION-MECHANISM",ACS CATALYSIS,,

Automatic pancreatic tumor image segmentation is often provided by computer-aided screening (CAD), diagnosis and quantitative evaluations in radiology images such as CT and MRI. Tumor classification through these methods can also help to track, predict and endorse customized therapy as a part of effective treatment, without invasions of cancer. Nowadays, neural networks (NN) have shown promising results for precise pancreatic image segmentation. This paper presents a deep learning-based Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (HCNN) for pancreatic tumor detection. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is provided to meet the issue of spatial discrepancy segmentation across slices of adjacent images. The recurrent neural network generates CNN results and fine-tunes its segmentation by enhancing the smoothness and shape. Furthermore, the HCNN training and configurations objectives have been illustrated to the performance of pancreatic tumor image segmentation.

However,a fast and accurate volume acquisition brings great challenges. On the one hand, it is both time consuming and operator dependent for manual segmentation, which is the gold standard for volume estimation. On the other hand, low contrast to normal tissues, irregular shapes and distributions of the hemorrhage make the existing automatic segmentation methods hard to achieve satisfactory performance. Method: To solve above problems, a CNN based architecture is proposed in this work, consisting of a novel model, which is named as Psi-Net and a multi-level training strategy. In the structure of Psi-Net, a self-attention block and a contextual-attention block is designed to suppresses the irrelevant information and segment border areas of the hemorrhage more finely. Further, an multi-level training strategy is put forward to facilitate the training process. By adding the slice-level learning and a weighted loss, the multi-level training strategy effectively alleviates the problems of vanishing gradient and the class imbalance. The proposed training strategy could be applied to most of the segmentation networks, especially for complex models and on small datasets. Results: The proposed architecture is evaluated on a spontaneous ICH dataset and a traumatic ICH dataset. Compared to the previous works on the ICH sementation, the proposed architecture obtains the state-ofthe-art performance(Dice of 0.950) on the spontaneous ICH, and comparable results(Dice of 0.895) with the best method on the traumatic ICH. On the other hand, the time consumption of the proposed architecture is much less than the previous methods on both training and inference. Morever, experiment results on various of models prove the universality of the multi-level training strategy. Conclusions: This study proposed a novel CNN-based architecture, Psi-Net with multi-level training strategy. It takes less time for training and achives superior performance than previous ICH segmentaion methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Current clinical approaches to DFU treatment rely on patient and clinician vigilance, which has significant limitations, such as the high cost involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and lengthy care of the DFU. We collected an extensive dataset of foot images, which contain DFU from different patients. In this DFU classification problem, we assessed the two classes as normal skin (healthy skin) and abnormal skin (DFU). In this paper, we have proposed the use of machine learning algorithms to extract the features for DFU and healthy skin patches to understand the differences in the computer vision perspective. This experiment is performed to evaluate the skin conditions of both classes that are at high risk of misclassification by computer vision algorithms. Furthermore, we used convolutional neural networks for the first time in this binary classification. We have proposed a novel convolutional neural network architecture, DFUNet, with better feature extraction to identify the feature differences between healthy skin and the DFU.

Invasive pathological tests for the classification of MLNs into benign and malignant have various shortcomings like painfulness, the risk associated with anesthesia, and depends to a large extent on skillset and preferences of the surgeon performing the test. Hence, computer-aided system for MLNs severity detection has been explored widely by the researchers. Very recently, in our earlier concluded work on non-invasive method for MLNs differential diagnosis in computed tomography (CT) images, combination of different data augmentation approaches and state-of-art fully convolutional network (FCN) were implemented to enhance the performance of malignancy detection. However, the performance of FCN network were highly depended on the selection of appropriate data augmentation approach and control of their hyperparameters. Moreover, a standard practice to get hierarchical features in convolutional neural network (CNN) models requires deeper stacking of layers. This leads to an increase in number of trainable parameters which prone to overfitting of the network.
Methods: In view of the above mention limitations, in this paper, authors have proposed an approach that includes: 1) Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for data augmentation, and 2) Inception network for malignancy detection. Unlike conventional data augmentation strategy, GAN based augmentation approach generates data that correlates to original data distribution. In the case of Inception based model, it uses multiple size kernels with factorized convolution for hierarchical feature extraction. This helps to a significant reduction in trainable parameters and the problem of overfitting.
Results: In this paper, experiments with different GAN approaches, as well as with different Inception architectures, are conducted to evaluate and justify the selection of appropriate GAN and Inception architecture, respectively for MLNs severity detection. The proposed approach achieves superior results with an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of 94.95%, 93.65%, 96.67%, and 95%, respectively.
Conclusion: The obtained results validate the usefulness of GANs for data augmentation in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant MLNs.

The hand function assessment, however, requires the patient to complete a series of actions under the guidance of the therapist who then scores the patient's performance. This type of assessment is both time-consuming and highly subjective. Therefore, in order to achieve a fast, objective and accurate assessment, this paper adopts a non-contact infrared imaging device, Leap Motion, to measure the patient's motion information and then uses these motion information to infer the hand's rehabilitation level. This paper improves the traditional way of hand function assessment from the following aspects. Only three coherent movements (finger opposition, lift wrist and stretch fingers) are required to complete the assessment, which makes the assessment time shorter and the assessment process easier. At the same time, an assessment algorithm based on the Ensemble Learning is proposed and integrated into the automatic hand function assessment system. In addition, the virtual reality game has been implemented in the assessment system to ensure a satisfactory interaction with patients, which makes the assessment process more interesting and convenient. Using this system, 50 stroke patients underwent clinical trials with the Brunnstrom and Fugl-Meyer assessment scales. The matching rate between the automatic assessment result and the manual Brunnstrom assessment result is 92%, while the matching rate with the Fugl-Meyer assessment result is 82%. Furthermore, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kappa test are also used to validate the consistency between the automatic assessment results and the manual assessment results. These experiments illustrate that this automatic assessment system is fast, comfortable and reliable.","Automatic assessment,Brunnstrom assessment,ensemble learning,Fugl-Meyer assessment,hand function assessment,rehabilitation,Leap Motion",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Computer Science,,1.572,"SIGN-LANGUAGE,RECOGNITION,CONTROLLER,ACCURACY",CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS,,

It is a challenge to investigate the polypharmacology mechanism of TCM with multiple components. In this study, we used XiaoErFuPi (XEFP) granules as an example to describe an unsupervised learning strategy for polypharmacology research of TCM and to explore the mechanism of XEFP polypharmacology against multifactorial disease function dyspepsia (FD). Unsupervised clustering of compounds based on similarity evaluation of cellular function fingerprints showed that compounds of TCM without similar targets and chemical structure could also exert similar therapeutic effects on the same disease, as different targets participate in the same pathway closely associated with the pathological process. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised machine learning strategy for exploring the polypharmacology-based mechanism of TCM, utilizing hierarchical clustering based on cellular functional similarity, to establish a connection from the chemical clustering module to cellular function. Meanwhile, FDA-approved drugs against FD were used as references for the mechanism of action (MoA) of FD. First, according to the compound-compound network built by the similarity of cellular function of XEFP compounds and FDA-approved FD drugs, the possible therapeutic function of TCM may represent a known mechanism of FDA-approved drugs. Then, as unsupervised learning, hierarchical clustering of TCM compounds based on cellular function fingerprint similarity could help to classify the compounds into several modules with similar therapeutic functions to investigate the polypharmacology effect of TCM. Furthermore, the integration of quantitative omics data of TCM and approved drugs (from LINCS datasets) provides more quantitative evidence for TCM therapeutic function consistency with approved drugs. A spasmolytic activity experiment was launched to confirm vanillic acid activity to repress smooth muscle contraction; vanillic acid was also predicted to be active compound of XEFP, supporting the accuracy of our strategy. In summary, the approach proposed in this study provides a new unsupervised learning strategy for poly pharmacological research investigating TCM by establishing a connection between the compound functional module and drug-activated cellular processes shared with FDA-approved drugs, which may elucidate the unique mechanism of traditional medicine using FDA-approved drugs as references, facilitate the discovery of potential active compounds of TCM and provide new insights into complex diseases.","Polypharmacology,Traditional Chinese medicine,Unsupervised clustering,Cellular function fingerprints,FDA-approved drugs,Functional dyspepsia",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,7.377,,PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,

Moreover, mass effects as observed for brain tumors may displace tissue, creating larger deformations over time than what is observed in a healthy brain. Deep learning models have successfully been applied to image registration to offer dramatic speed up and to use surrogate information (e.g., segmentations) during training. However, existing approaches focus on learning registration models using images from healthy patients. They are therefore not designed for the registration of images with strong pathologies for example in the context of brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries. In this work, we explore a deep learning approach to register images with brain tumors to an atlas. Our model learns an appearance mapping from images with tumors to the atlas, while simultaneously predicting the transformation to atlas space. Using separate decoders, the network disentangles the tumor mass effect from the reconstruction of quasi-normal images. Results on both synthetic and real brain tumor scans show that our approach outperforms cost function masking for registration to the atlas and that reconstructed quasi-normal images can be used for better longitudinal registrations.",,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a general deep learning architecture for MRI homogenization that also provides the segmentation map of an anatomical region of interest. Homogenization is achieved using an unsupervised architecture based on variational autoencoder with cycle generative adversarial networks, which learns a common space (i.e. a representation of the optimal imaging protocol) using an unpaired image-to-image translation network. The segmentation is simultaneously generated by a supervised learning strategy.

However, most existing methods simply view the input DMRI data as a vector without considering data structure in the q-space.

This paper presents a single 1-D CNN model and an ensemble model with parallel 1-D CNNs for diagnosing VRF system refrigerant charge faults under heating condition. From the cleaned experiment data of a commercial VRF system, 15 features are selected as the input for the proposed model with ReliefF algorithm.

However, after long-term oper-ation in a complex environment, various faults may occur in the VRF systems, resulting in failure to meet users comfort requirements and even unnecessary increase in energy consumption. This paper proposes a simulated annealing wrapped generic ensemble fault diagnosis strategy for typical faults of VRF systems, such as refrigerant charge amount (RCA) faults, valve faults, and compressor liquid return (LF) faults. The simulated annealing algorithm based on random forest (SA-RF) is first utilized to perform feature selec-tion process on the three kinds of fault datasets to select the optimal variables that can well characterize the fault states, which can improve the modeling efficiency while reducing the data dimensionality. Then five component learners and the proposed ensemble model based on them are established adopting the optimal variables as input variables. Through visualizing the error evolution and margin of the boosting models built in the first stage of the integration process, it was found that the boosting models can effec-tively avoid overfitting and most samples are correctly classified with high confidence. By comparing with the five component learners, it is concluded that the boosting strategy in the first stage can improve the diagnostic performance of the models, and the weighted voting integration strategy in the second stage can further improve the diagnostic performance of the model. The final ensemble model can effec-tively compensate for the deficiencies of each component learners and its diagnostic accuracy for the three fault data sets is as high as 95.37%, 99.36% and 98.3%, respectively, indicating that the model can be applied to diagnose the three types of faults in VRF system at the same time, showing a high versatility.
