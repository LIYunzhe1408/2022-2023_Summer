The standard detection technique is a Giemsa-stained blood smear test, which requires a highly skilled technician. Automated classifications of different phases of malaria continue to be a challenge with limited label data, especially in the case of early trophozoite and late trophozoite or schizont phase where the sensitivity is lower. The aim of the study is to develop a fast, robust and fully automated malaria classification system with limited labeled data set by using a multi-wavelength based system and a pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The multi-wavelength system improves the classification performance by increasing the training dataset. We also compare our customized CNN performance with other conventional CNNs and show that our network with a lesser number of layers has a comparable performance. We believe that our approach can be applied to other limited annotated biological datasets.","Malaria,Red blood cells,Quantitative phase imaging,Machine learning,Transfer learning and convolutional neural network",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Optics,Physics",,3.566,"IMAGING,TECHNIQUES,NEURAL-NETWORKS",OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06056,

In recent years, the monitoring and classification of acoustic signals of respiratory-related disease is a significant characteristic in the pulmonary analysis. Lung sounds produce appropriate evidence related to pulmonary disorders, and to assess subjects pulmonary situations. However, this traditional method suffers from restrictions, such as if the doctor isn't very much practiced, this may lead to an incorrect analysis. The objective of this research work is to build a telemedicine framework to predict respiratory pathology using lung sound examination. In this paper, the three approaches has been compared to machine learning for the detection of lung sounds. The proposed telemedicine framework trained through Bagging and Boosting classifiers (Improved Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting algorithm) with an extracted set of handcrafted features. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of Improved Random Forest was higher than Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost classifiers. The overall classification accuracy for the Improved Random Forest algorithm has 99.04%. The telemedicine framework was implemented with the Improved Random Forest algorithm. The telemedicine framework has achieved phenomenal performance in recognizing respiratory pathology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Named Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), this highly contagious disease was caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. With a transmission rate greater than SARS or common flu, continued tremendous efforts will be needed to successfully combat this disease. In this article, we review the role that data science is playing in this war. Data science, combined with statistical analysis, computer science and computational biology, is helping in myriad ways with applications including epidemiology, drug discovery, and molecular design for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A number of data driven models, mathematical models, correlations and predictive models have been developed for COVID-19. Challenges faced by the data scientists today have been highlighted. Finally, open source datasets sources are mentioned that can be potentially used in diagnostics and evaluation of health policies.

4,Psi-Net: Focusing on the border areas of intracerebral hemorrhage on CT images,194,,,"Kuang Zhuo,Deng Xianbo,Yu Li,Wang Hongkui,Li Tiansong,Wang Shengwei","Kuang Z,Deng XB,Yu L,Wang HK,Li TS,Wang SW",Yu L,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105546,Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Background and objective: The volume of the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) obtained from CT scans is essential for quantification and treatment planning. However,a fast and accurate volume acquisition brings great challenges. On the one hand, it is both time consuming and operator dependent for manual segmentation, which is the gold standard for volume estimation. On the other hand, low contrast to normal tissues, irregular shapes and distributions of the hemorrhage make the existing automatic segmentation methods hard to achieve satisfactory performance. Method: To solve above problems, a CNN based architecture is proposed in this work, consisting of a novel model, which is named as Psi-Net and a multi-level training strategy. In the structure of Psi-Net, a self-attention block and a contextual-attention block is designed to suppresses the irrelevant information and segment border areas of the hemorrhage more finely. Further, an multi-level training strategy is put forward to facilitate the training process. By adding the slice-level learning and a weighted loss, the multi-level training strategy effectively alleviates the problems of vanishing gradient and the class imbalance. The proposed training strategy could be applied to most of the segmentation networks, especially for complex models and on small datasets. Results: The proposed architecture is evaluated on a spontaneous ICH dataset and a traumatic ICH dataset. Compared to the previous works on the ICH sementation, the proposed architecture obtains the state-ofthe-art performance(Dice of 0.950) on the spontaneous ICH, and comparable results(Dice of 0.895) with the best method on the traumatic ICH. On the other hand, the time consumption of the proposed architecture is much less than the previous methods on both training and inference. Morever, experiment results on various of models prove the universality of the multi-level training strategy. Conclusions: This study proposed a novel CNN-based architecture, Psi-Net with multi-level training strategy. It takes less time for training and achives superior performance than previous ICH segmentaion methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a major complication of this disease, which if not managed properly can lead to amputation. Current clinical approaches to DFU treatment rely on patient and clinician vigilance, which has significant limitations, such as the high cost involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and lengthy care of the DFU. We collected an extensive dataset of foot images, which contain DFU from different patients. In this DFU classification problem, we assessed the two classes as normal skin (healthy skin) and abnormal skin (DFU). In this paper, we have proposed the use of machine learning algorithms to extract the features for DFU and healthy skin patches to understand the differences in the computer vision perspective. This experiment is performed to evaluate the skin conditions of both classes that are at high risk of misclassification by computer vision algorithms. Furthermore, we used convolutional neural networks for the first time in this binary classification. We have proposed a novel convolutional neural network architecture, DFUNet, with better feature extraction to identify the feature differences between healthy skin and the DFU. Using 10-fold cross validation, DFUNet achieved an AUC score of 0.961. This outperformed both the traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers we have tested. Here, we present the development of a novel and highly sensitive DFUNet for objectively detecting the presence of DFUs. This novel approach has the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in diabetic foot care among diabetic patients, which represent a cost-effective, remote, and convenient healthcare solution.","Diabetic foot ulcers,classification,deep learning,convolutional neural networks,DFUNet",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Computer Science,,,"IMAGE-ANALYSIS,WOUNDS,HISTOGRAMS,INFECTION,SPECTRUM",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/619963/13/yap%20author_copy.pdf,
6,Performance improvement of mediastinal lymph node severity detection using GAN and Inception network,194,,,"Tekchandani Hitesh,Verma Shrish,Londhe Narendra","Tekchandani H,Verma S,Londhe N",Londhe N,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105478,National Institute of Technology (NIT System),"Background and objective: In lung cancer, the determination of mediastinal lymph node (MLN) status as benign or malignant influence treatment planning and survival rate. Invasive pathological tests for the classification of MLNs into benign and malignant have various shortcomings like painfulness, the risk associated with anesthesia, and depends to a large extent on skillset and preferences of the surgeon performing the test. Hence, computer-aided system for MLNs severity detection has been explored widely by the researchers. Very recently, in our earlier concluded work on non-invasive method for MLNs differential diagnosis in computed tomography (CT) images, combination of different data augmentation approaches and state-of-art fully convolutional network (FCN) were implemented to enhance the performance of malignancy detection. However, the performance of FCN network were highly depended on the selection of appropriate data augmentation approach and control of their hyperparameters. Moreover, a standard practice to get hierarchical features in convolutional neural network (CNN) models requires deeper stacking of layers. This leads to an increase in number of trainable parameters which prone to overfitting of the network.
Methods: In view of the above mention limitations, in this paper, authors have proposed an approach that includes: 1) Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for data augmentation, and 2) Inception network for malignancy detection. Unlike conventional data augmentation strategy, GAN based augmentation approach generates data that correlates to original data distribution. In the case of Inception based model, it uses multiple size kernels with factorized convolution for hierarchical feature extraction. This helps to a significant reduction in trainable parameters and the problem of overfitting.
Results: In this paper, experiments with different GAN approaches, as well as with different Inception architectures, are conducted to evaluate and justify the selection of appropriate GAN and Inception architecture, respectively for MLNs severity detection. The proposed approach achieves superior results with an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of 94.95%, 93.65%, 96.67%, and 95%, respectively.
Conclusion: The obtained results validate the usefulness of GANs for data augmentation in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant MLNs. The proposed Inception network based classifier for malignancy detection shows promising results compared to all investigated methods presented in various literature. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The hand function assessment, however, requires the patient to complete a series of actions under the guidance of the therapist who then scores the patient's performance. This type of assessment is both time-consuming and highly subjective. Therefore, in order to achieve a fast, objective and accurate assessment, this paper adopts a non-contact infrared imaging device, Leap Motion, to measure the patient's motion information and then uses these motion information to infer the hand's rehabilitation level. This paper improves the traditional way of hand function assessment from the following aspects. Only three coherent movements (finger opposition, lift wrist and stretch fingers) are required to complete the assessment, which makes the assessment time shorter and the assessment process easier. At the same time, an assessment algorithm based on the Ensemble Learning is proposed and integrated into the automatic hand function assessment system. In addition, the virtual reality game has been implemented in the assessment system to ensure a satisfactory interaction with patients, which makes the assessment process more interesting and convenient. Using this system, 50 stroke patients underwent clinical trials with the Brunnstrom and Fugl-Meyer assessment scales. The matching rate between the automatic assessment result and the manual Brunnstrom assessment result is 92%, while the matching rate with the Fugl-Meyer assessment result is 82%. Furthermore, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kappa test are also used to validate the consistency between the automatic assessment results and the manual assessment results. These experiments illustrate that this automatic assessment system is fast, comfortable and reliable.","Automatic assessment,Brunnstrom assessment,ensemble learning,Fugl-Meyer assessment,hand function assessment,rehabilitation,Leap Motion",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Computer Science,,1.572,"SIGN-LANGUAGE,RECOGNITION,CONTROLLER,ACCURACY",CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS,,

It is a challenge to investigate the polypharmacology mechanism of TCM with multiple components. In this study, we used XiaoErFuPi (XEFP) granules as an example to describe an unsupervised learning strategy for polypharmacology research of TCM and to explore the mechanism of XEFP polypharmacology against multifactorial disease function dyspepsia (FD). Unsupervised clustering of compounds based on similarity evaluation of cellular function fingerprints showed that compounds of TCM without similar targets and chemical structure could also exert similar therapeutic effects on the same disease, as different targets participate in the same pathway closely associated with the pathological process. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised machine learning strategy for exploring the polypharmacology-based mechanism of TCM, utilizing hierarchical clustering based on cellular functional similarity, to establish a connection from the chemical clustering module to cellular function. Meanwhile, FDA-approved drugs against FD were used as references for the mechanism of action (MoA) of FD. First, according to the compound-compound network built by the similarity of cellular function of XEFP compounds and FDA-approved FD drugs, the possible therapeutic function of TCM may represent a known mechanism of FDA-approved drugs. Then, as unsupervised learning, hierarchical clustering of TCM compounds based on cellular function fingerprint similarity could help to classify the compounds into several modules with similar therapeutic functions to investigate the polypharmacology effect of TCM. Furthermore, the integration of quantitative omics data of TCM and approved drugs (from LINCS datasets) provides more quantitative evidence for TCM therapeutic function consistency with approved drugs. A spasmolytic activity experiment was launched to confirm vanillic acid activity to repress smooth muscle contraction; vanillic acid was also predicted to be active compound of XEFP, supporting the accuracy of our strategy. In summary, the approach proposed in this study provides a new unsupervised learning strategy for poly pharmacological research investigating TCM by establishing a connection between the compound functional module and drug-activated cellular processes shared with FDA-approved drugs, which may elucidate the unique mechanism of traditional medicine using FDA-approved drugs as references, facilitate the discovery of potential active compounds of TCM and provide new insights into complex diseases.","Polypharmacology,Traditional Chinese medicine,Unsupervised clustering,Cellular function fingerprints,FDA-approved drugs,Functional dyspepsia",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,7.377,,PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,

Deep learning models have successfully been applied to image registration to offer dramatic speed up and to use surrogate information (e.g., segmentations) during training. However, existing approaches focus on learning registration models using images from healthy patients. They are therefore not designed for the registration of images with strong pathologies for example in the context of brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries. In this work, we explore a deep learning approach to register images with brain tumors to an atlas. Our model learns an appearance mapping from images with tumors to the atlas, while simultaneously predicting the transformation to atlas space. Using separate decoders, the network disentangles the tumor mass effect from the reconstruction of quasi-normal images.

However, after long-term oper-ation in a complex environment, various faults may occur in the VRF systems, resulting in failure to meet users comfort requirements and even unnecessary increase in energy consumption. This paper proposes a simulated annealing wrapped generic ensemble fault diagnosis strategy for typical faults of VRF systems, such as refrigerant charge amount (RCA) faults, valve faults, and compressor liquid return (LF) faults. The simulated annealing algorithm based on random forest (SA-RF) is first utilized to perform feature selec-tion process on the three kinds of fault datasets to select the optimal variables that can well characterize the fault states, which can improve the modeling efficiency while reducing the data dimensionality. Then five component learners and the proposed ensemble model based on them are established adopting the optimal variables as input variables. Through visualizing the error evolution and margin of the boosting models built in the first stage of the integration process, it was found that the boosting models can effec-tively avoid overfitting and most samples are correctly classified with high confidence. By comparing with the five component learners, it is concluded that the boosting strategy in the first stage can improve the diagnostic performance of the models, and the weighted voting integration strategy in the second stage can further improve the diagnostic performance of the model. The final ensemble model can effec-tively compensate for the deficiencies of each component learners and its diagnostic accuracy for the three fault data sets is as high as 95.37%, 99.36% and 98.3%, respectively, indicating that the model can be applied to diagnose the three types of faults in VRF system at the same time, showing a high versatility.

The development of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques for HVAC system is becoming increasingly essential for building energy saving. The present paper proposes a comparison study on the basic data-driven methods for variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system fault diagnosis. And five widely used data-driven methods were analyzed, which were decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM), clustering (CL), shallow neural networks (SNN), and deep neural networks (DNN). The six common types of fault data in VRF system and three evaluation indexes were used to compare the performance of the proposed five FDD methods in single fault and multiple faults. Results indicate that the single fault diagnosis performance of all methods is better than multiple fault diagnosis. The performances of DNN, SNN, and SVM are better than CART and CL no matter single fault or multiple fault diagnosis. Among them, we believe that the SVM method is preferred for single fault diagnosis and the DNN method is preferred for multiple fault diagnosis. And the performance of method CL is the worst, especially in the case of multiple fault classification, the accuracy is only about 48%. The study results are dedicated to providing a reference for subsequent research in FDD of VRF system. Some important remarks are finally concluded in this paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In a previous stage, the so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment or cognitive loss appears. Nevertheless, this previous stage does not seem sufficiently severe to interfere in independent abilities of daily life, so it is usually diagnosed inappropriately. Thus, its detection is a crucial challenge to be addressed by medical specialists. This paper presents a novel proposal for such early diagnosis based on automatic analysis of speech and disfluencies, and Deep Learning methodologies. The proposed tools could be useful for supporting Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis. The Deep Learning approach includes Convolutional Neural Networks and nonlinear multifeature modeling.

As the main idea of our design, we expect to get reference from the surrounding normal structures (bladder&rectum) and take advantage of this information to facilitate the prostate bed segmentation. To achieve this goal, we first use a U-Net as the backbone network to perform the bladder&rectum segmentation, which serves as a low-level task that can provide references to the high-level task of the prostate bed segmentation. Based on the backbone network, we build a novel attention network with a series of cascaded attention modules to further extract discriminative features for the high-level prostate bed segmentation task. Since the attention network has one-sided dependency on the backbone network, simulating the clinical workflow to use normal structures to guide the segmentation of radiotherapy target, we name the final composition model asymmetrical multi-task attention U-Net.

The aim of this study is to determine the best methods for stochastic model inversion in order to improve current methods in skin related cancer diagnostics and in the future develop a non-invasive way to measure the physical parameters of the skin based partially on the results of the study.

Fine-grained classification is of great clinical importance when guiding clinical decisions on the diagnoses and treatment, which remains very challenging. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a novel way to classify cervical cells by using automatically learned features. Although the ensemble of CNN models can increase model diversity and potentially boost the classification accuracy, it is a multi-step process, as several CNN models need to be trained respectively and then be selected for ensemble. On the other hand, due to the small training samples, the advantages of powerful CNN models may not be effectively leveraged. In order to address such a challenging issue, this paper proposes a transfer learning based snapshot ensemble (TLSE) method by integrating snapshot ensemble learning with transfer learning in a unified and coordinated way. Snapshot ensemble provides ensemble benefits within a single model training procedure, while transfer learning focuses on the small sample problem in cervical cells classification. Furthermore, a new training strategy is proposed for guaranteeing the combination. The TLSE method is evaluated on a pap-smear dataset called Herlev dataset and is proved to have some superiorities over the exiting methods. It demonstrates that TLSE can improve the accuracy in an ensemble manner with only one single training process for the small sample in fine-grained cervical cells classification.","cervical cells classification,snapshot ensemble,transfer learning,deep convolutional neural network,deep learning,medical image",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,CANCER,SEGMENTATION,ALGORITHM",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/20/7292/pdf,

The algorithms are based on recent advances in multi-dimensional signal processing and aim to advance current state-of-the-art computer-aided detection and analysis of breast tumours when these are observed at various states of development. The topics discussed include image feature extraction, information fusion using radiomics, multi-parametric computer-aided classification and diagnosis using information fusion of tensorial datasets as well as Clifford algebra based classification approaches and convolutional neural network deep learning methodologies. The discussion also extends to semi-supervised deep learning and self-supervised strategies as well as generative adversarial networks and algorithms using generated confrontational learning approaches. In order to address the problem of weakly labelled tumour images, generative adversarial deep learning strategies are considered for the classification of different tumour types. The proposed data fusion approaches provide a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework for more robust image registration that can potentially advance the early identification of heterogeneous tumour types, even when the associated imaged organs are registered as separate entities embedded in more complex geometric spaces. Finally, the general structure of a high-dimensional medical imaging analysis platform that is based on multi-task detection and learning is proposed as a way forward. The proposed algorithm makes use of novel loss functions that form the building blocks for a generated confrontation learning methodology that can be used for tensorial DCE-MRI. Since some of the approaches discussed are also based on time-lapse imaging, conclusions on the rate of proliferation of the disease can be made possible.

First, the probability of each point belonging to the hematoma region was determined using a combination of hand-crafted and deep features. This probability provided the initial state of the segmentation. Next, a 3D post-processing model was applied to evolve the initial state and delineate the hematoma.

We are developing a new generation of gas sensors, known as multivariable sensors, that have several independent responses for multi-gas detection with a single sensor. In this study, we analyze the capabilities of natural and fabricated photonic three-dimensional (3-D) nanostructures as sensors for the detection of different gaseous species, such as vapors and non-condensable gases. We employed bare Morpho butterfly wing scales to control their gas selectivity with different illumination angles. Next, we chemically functionalized Morpho butterfly wing scales with a fluorinated silane to boost the response of these nanostructures to the vapors of interest and to suppress the response to ambient humidity. Further, we followed our previously developed design rules for sensing nanostructures and fabricated bioinspired inorganic 3-D nanostructures to achieve functionality beyond natural Morpho scales. These fabricated nanostructures have embedded catalytically active gold nanoparticles to operate at high temperatures of approximate to 300 degrees C for the detection of gases for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.

However, the current lack of pertinent design rules has led to a hesitance to accept structural members made with RAC. It would entail even more difficulties when facing application scenarios where brittle failure is possible (e.g., beam in shear). In this paper, existing major shear design formulae established primarily for conventional concrete beams were assessed for RAC beams. Results showed that when applied to the shear test database compiled for RAC beams, those formulae provided only inaccurate estimations with surprisingly large scatter. To cope with this bias, machine learning (ML) techniques deemed as potential alternative predictors were resorted to. First, a Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was carried out to rank the importance of the parameters that would affect the shear capacity of RAC beams. Then, two contemporary ML approaches, namely, the artificial neural network (ANN) and the random forest (RF), were leveraged to simulate the beams' shear strength. It was found that both models produced even better predictions than the evaluated formulae. With this superiority, a parametric study was undertaken to observe the trends of how the parameters played roles in influencing the shear resistance of RAC beams. The findings indicated that, though less influential than the structural parameters such as shear span ratio, the effect of the replacement ratio of recycled aggregate (RA) was still significant. Nevertheless, the value of v(c)/(f(c))(1/2) (i.e., the shear contribution from RAC normalized with respect to the square root of its strength) predicted by the ML-based approaches appeared to be insignificantly affected by the replacement level. Given the existing inevitable large experimental scatter, more shear tests are certainly needed and, for safe application of RAC, using partial factors calibrated to consider the uncertainty is feasible when designing the shear strength of RAC beams. Some suggestions for future works are also given at the end of this paper.","recycled aggregate concrete,beam,shear capacity,Grey relational analysis,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,FLEXURAL,PERFORMANCE,TRANSVERSE,REINFORCEMENT,ELASTIC-MODULUS,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,SIZE,DESIGN,ELEMENTS",MATERIALS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602073,

It characterizes optical changes in regolith materials due to space weathering as a new retention parameter and introduces a novel machine learning inversion model for retrieving the physical properties of the regolith. Our analysis suggests that the reddening of the soil predominantly governs the retention, along with attenuated mafic band depths. Moreover, semi-variograms show that the spatial variability of He-3 is aligned with the episodic weathering events at different timescales. We also observed that pyroclastic regoliths with high dielectric constant and increased surface scattering mechanisms exhibited a He-3 abundant region. For ejecta cover, the retention was weakly associated with the dielectric contrast and a circular polarization ratio (CPR), mainly because of the He-3-deficient nature of the regolith. Furthermore, cross-variograms revealed inherent cyclicity attributed to the sequential process of weathering effects.

Recently, generating interatomic potentials was shown to be much easier when machine learning (ML) algorithms were used. In addition, ML algorithms require new descriptors for improved performance. Here, we present an ML approach with several categories of atomic descriptors to predict the parameters necessary for MD simulations, such as the potential energies and the atomic forces. We propose several atomic descriptors based on structural information and find that better descriptors can be generated from eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Moreover, we observe fewer descriptors that perform better in predicting the potential energies and the forces during methane activation processes on a catalytic Pt(111) surface. These results were consistently observed in two different ML algorithms: fully-connected neural network (FNN) and XGBoost.

However, not many works deal with different physiological states in the user, which can provide significant heart rate variations, being these a key matter when working with ECG biometrics. Techniques in machine learning simplify the feature extraction process, where sometimes it can be reduced to a fixed segmentation. The applied database includes visits taken in two different days and three different conditions (sitting down, standing up after exercise), which is not common in current public databases. These characteristics allow studying differences among users under different scenarios, which may affect the pattern in the acquired data. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is used as a classifier to form a baseline, as it has a simple structure that has provided good results in the state-of-the-art. This work studies its behavior in ECG verification by using QRS complexes, finding its best hyperparameter configuration through tuning. The final performance is calculated considering different visits for enrolling and verification. Differentiation in the QRS complexes is also tested, as it is already required for detection, proving that applying a simple first differentiation gives a good result in comparison to state-of-the-art similar works. Moreover, it also improves the computational cost by avoiding complex transformations and using only one type of signal.

39,Prediction of Slag Characteristics Based on Artificial Neural Network for Molten Gasification of Hazardous Wastes,13,19,,"Lin Xiongchao,Xi Wenshuai,Dai Jinze,Wang Caihong,Wang Yonggang","Lin XC,Xi WS,Dai JZ,Wang CH,Wang YG",Lin XC,10.3390/en13195115,China University of Mining & Technology,"Molten gasification is considered as a promising technology for the processing and safe disposal of hazardous wastes. During this process, the organic components are completely converted while the hazardous materials are safely embedded in slag via the fusion-solidification-vitrification transformation. Ideally, the slag should be glassy with low viscosity to ensure the effective immobilization and steady discharge of hazardous materials. However, it is very difficult to predict the characteristics of slag using existing empirical equations or conventional mathematical methods, due to the complex non-linear relationship among the phase transformation, vitrification transition and chemical composition of slag. Equipped with a strong nonlinear mapping ability, an artificial neural network may be able to predict the properties of slags if a large amount of data is available for training. In this work, over 10,000 experimental data points were used to train and develop a slag classification model (glassy vs. non-glassy) based on a neural network. The optimal structure of the neural network was figured out and validated. The results suggest that the classification accuracy for the independent test samples reached 93.3%. Using 1 and 0 as model inputs to represent mildly reducing and inert atmospheres, a double hidden layer structure in the neural network enabled the accurate classification of slags under various atmospheres. Furthermore, the neural network for the prediction of glassy slag viscosity was optimized; it featured a double hidden layer structure. Under a mildly reducing atmosphere, the absolute error from the independent test data was generally within 4 Pa center dot s. By adding a gas atmosphere into the input of the neural network using a simple normalization method, a multi-atmosphere slag viscosity prediction model was developed. Said model is much more accurate than its counterpart that does not consider the effect of the atmosphere. In summary, the artificial neural network proved to be an effective approach to predicting the slag properties under different atmospheres. The data-driven models developed in this work are expected to facilitate the commercial deployment of molten gasification technology.","artificial neural network,hazardous wastes,molten gasification,slag,viscosity",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Energy & Fuels,,3.085,"ENTRAINED-FLOW,GASIFIER,MUNICIPAL,SOLID-WASTE,COAL-WATER,SLURRY,VISCOSITY,BEHAVIOR,HIGH-TEMPERATURES,ASH,SLAG,CRYSTALLIZATION,MODEL,IRON,RICH",ENERGIES,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5115/pdf,

Results show that the developed models including Gaussian processes, deep learning, and gradient boosting regression achieved robust predictive performance, with the gradient boosting regression trees yielding highest prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization coupled with gradient boosting regression trees model was developed to optimize the mixture design of RAC for various compressive strength classes.

The proposed system is based on a lightweight deep neural network architecture composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input individual CT slices, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that takes as input multiple feature embeddings provided by the CNN. For efficient processing, we consider various feature selection methods to produce a subset of useful CNN features for the LSTM. Furthermore, we reduce the CT slices by a factor of 2x, which enables us to train the model faster. Even if our model is designed to balance speed and accuracy, we report a weighted mean log loss of 0.04989 on the final test set, which places us in the top 30 ranking (2%) from a total of 1345 participants.

Data imbalance can cause overfitting problems and, consequently, poor classification performance. The purpose of this study is to improve BCI performance by solving this data imbalance problem with sampling techniques. The sampling techniques were applied to BCI data in 15 subjects controlling a door lock, 15 subjects an electric light, and 14 subjects a Bluetooth speaker. We explored two categories of sampling techniques: oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling techniques, including random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), borderline-SMOTE, support vector machine (SVM) SMOTE, and adaptive synthetic sampling, were used to increase the number of samples for the class of target stimuli. Undersampling techniques, including random undersampling, neighborhood cleaning rule, Tomek's links, and weighted undersampling bagging, were used to reduce the class size of nontarget stimuli. The over- or undersampled data were classified by an SVM classifier. Overall, some oversampling techniques improved BCI performance while undersampling techniques often degraded performance. Particularly, using borderline-SMOTE yielded the highest accuracy (87.27%) and information transfer rate (8.82 bpm) across all three appliances. Moreover, borderline-SMOTE led to performance improvement, especially for poor performers. A further analysis showed that borderline-SMOTE improved SVM by generating more support vectors within the target class and enlarging margins. However, there was no difference in the accuracy between borderline-SMOTE and the method of applying the weighted regularization parameter of the SVM.

We approach 17 separate information extraction tasks, involving a wide range of pathologic features. To handle the diverse range of fields, we required 2 statistical models, a document classification method for pathologic features with a small set of possible values and a token extraction method for pathologic features with a large set of values. For each model, we used isotonic calibration to improve the model's estimates of its likelihood of being correct.
Results: Our best document classifier method, a convolutional neural network, achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.97 averaged over 12 fields and our best extraction method achieves an accuracy of 0.93 averaged over 5 fields. The performance saturates as a function of dataset size with as few as 128 data points. Furthermore, while our document classifier methods have reliable uncertainty estimates, our extraction-based methods do not, but after isotonic calibration, expected calibration error drops to below 0.03 for all extraction fields.

Automatic facial expression analysis has emerged as a potential solution for an objective, reliable, and valid measurement of pain. In this study, we propose a video based approach for the automatic measurement of self-reported pain and the observer pain intensity, respectively. To this end, we explore the added value of three self-reported pain scales, i.e., the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Sensory Scale (SEN), and the Affective Motivational Scale (AFF), as well as the Observer Pain Intensity (OPI) rating for a reliable assessment of pain intensity from facial expression. Using a spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) architecture, we propose to jointly minimize the mean absolute error of pain scores estimation for each of these scales while maximizing the consistency between them. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark database for pain measurement from videos, namely, the UNBC-McMaster Pain Archive. Our results show that enforcing the consistency between different self-reported pain intensity scores collected using different pain scales enhances the quality of predictions and improve the state of the art in automatic self-reported pain estimation.

Recently physics-driven deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to use neural networks for data-driven regularization. These methods unroll iterative optimization algorithms to solve the inverse problem objective function, by alternating between domain-specific data consistency and data-driven regularization via neural networks. The whole unrolled network is then trained end-to-end to learn the parameters of the network. Due to simplicity of data consistency updates with gradient descent steps, proximal gradient descent (PGD) is a common approach to unroll physics-driven DL reconstruction methods. However, PGD methods have slow convergence rates, necessitating a higher number of unrolled iterations, leading to memory issues in training and slower reconstruction times in testing. Inspired by efficient variants of PGD methods that use a history of the previous iterates, in this article, we propose a history-cognizant unrolling of the optimization algorithm with dense connections across iterations for improved performance. In our approach, the gradient descent steps are calculated at a trainable combination of the outputs of all the previous regularization units. We also apply this idea to unrolling variable splitting methods with quadratic relaxation. Our results in reconstruction of the fastMRI knee dataset show that the proposed history-cognizant approach reduces residual aliasing artifacts compared to its conventional unrolled counterpart without requiring extra computational power or increasing reconstruction time.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Image reconstruction,Inverse problems,Signal processing algorithms,Acceleration,Optimization,Neural networks,Inverse problems,unrolled optimization algorithms,physics-driven deep learning,neural networks,MRI reconstruction,recurrent neural networks",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,6.544,"ITERATIVE,IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION,LOW-DOSE,CT",IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07197,

Some cardiac diseases require special attention due to the urgency and risk factors involved. Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the cardiac diseases that require robust identification. Early prediction in MI cases without prior history remains to be an ongoing challenge. This article delivers a major novel contribution in the context of predictive classification of flattened T-wave MI cases. Therefore, a novel model-driven deep deterministic learning (MDDDL) approach is proposed. In MDDDL, two different data sets are used for the execution of operational activities in terms of flattened T-wave predictive classification. The first data set is the publicly available Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), and the second data set is exclusively obtained from the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Firstly, the systematic behaviour of MDDDL is defined in terms of pattern recognition of extracted features between T-wave alternans and flattened T-wave subjects, and then both data sets are merged considering data fusion approach and pre-defined conditions. Afterwards, the empirical approach is adopted in MDDDL evaluation in relation to global acceptance and state-of-the-art comparison. Finally, some qualitative improvements, such as inclusion of a backtracking factor for rapid prediction of flattened anomalies and increasing the number of features along with enhancement of fusion processes to reduce complexity, are required by the MDDDL and should be covered in future works.","Deep learning,Deep deterministic learning,Electrocardiography,Myocardial infarction,Prediction analysis,Artificial neural network",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,AUTOMATED,DETECTION,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,ECG,CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION,QUALITY",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

The development of the multiterminal system escalates the complexity of the container transport process and increases the demand for container exchange between different terminals within a port, known as interterminal transport (ITT). Trucks are still the primary modes of freight transportation to transport containers among most terminals. A trucking company needs to consider proper truck routing planning because, based on several studies, it played an essential role in coordinating ITT flows. Furthermore, optimal truck routing in the context of ITT significantly affects port productivity and efficiency. The study of deep reinforcement learning in truck routing optimization is still limited.

Deep learning is a state-of-the-art technique for MR image-based prostate cancer diagnosis, but one of major bottlenecks is the severe lack of annotated MR images. The traditional and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based data augmentation methods cannot ensure the quality and the diversity of generated training samples. In this paper, we have proposed a novel GAN model for synthesis of MR images by utilizing its powerful ability in modeling the complex data distributions. The proposed model is designed based on the architecture of deep convolutional GAN. To learn the more equivariant representation of images that is robust to the changes in the pose and spatial relationship of objects in the images, the capsule network is applied to replace CNN used in the discriminator of regular GAN. Meanwhile, the least squares loss has been adopted for both the generator and discriminator in the proposed GAN to address the vanishing gradient problem of sigmoid cross entropy loss function in regular GAN. Extensive experiments are conducted on the simulated and real MR images. The results demonstrate that the proposed capsule network-based GAN model can generate more realistic and higher quality MR images than the compared GANs. The quantitative comparisons show that among all evaluated models, the proposed GAN generally achieves the smallest Kullback-Leibler divergence values for image generation task and provides the best classification performance when it is introduced into the deep learning method for image classification task.","prostate cancer,MR image,image synthesis,GAN,capsule network",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"CANCER,REPRESENTATION,SYSTEM",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601698,

Although fast MRI sequences allow artifact free acquisition of individual 2D slices, motion commonly occurs in between slices acquisitions. Motion correction for each slice is thus very important for reconstruction of 3D fetal brain MRI, but is highly operator-dependent and time-consuming. Approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved encouraging performance on prediction of 3D motion parameters of arbitrarily oriented 2D slices, which, however, does not capitalize on important brain structural information. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-task learning framework to jointly learn the transformation parameters and tissue segmentation map of each slice, for providing brain anatomical information to guide the mapping from 2D slices to 3D volumetric space in a coarse to fine manner. In the coarse stage, the first network learns the features shared for both regression and segmentation tasks. In the refinement stage, to fully utilize the anatomical information, distance maps constructed based on the coarse segmentation are introduced to the second network. Finally, incorporation of the signed distance maps to guide the regression and segmentation together improves the performance in both tasks.

These mechanisms have implemented several tools for analyzing the cognitive workload, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been most frequently used due to their high precision. However, one of the main challenges in implementing the EEG signals is finding appropriate information for identifying cognitive states. Here, we present a new feature selection model for pattern recognition using information from EEG signals based on machine learning techniques called GALoRIS. GALoRIS combines Genetic Algorithms and Logistic Regression to create a new fitness function that identifies and selects the critical EEG features that contribute to recognizing high and low cognitive workloads and structures a new dataset capable of optimizing the model's predictive process. We found that GALoRIS identifies data related to high and low cognitive workloads of subjects while driving a vehicle using information extracted from multiple EEG signals, reducing the original dataset by more than 50% and maximizing the model's predictive capacity, achieving a precision rate greater than 90%.","electroencephalographic,feature selection,machine learning,prediction model",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"MENTAL,WORKLOAD,EMOTION,RECOGNITION,CLASSIFICATION,PREDICTION,ALGORITHM,STRESS,SYSTEM",SENSORS,https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/2117/331619/1/sensors-20-05881-v2.pdf,

According to the visual interpretation of 3 experienced board-certified nuclear medicine physicians, 256 subjects are determined to be abnormal, 77 subjects are potentially abnormal, 174 are normal, and 127 are nearly normal. The coefficients of the ellipse and cashew-shaped equations, together with some well-known features of PD existing in the literature, are employed to learn PD classifiers under various machine learning approaches. A repeated hold-out with 100 rounds of 5-fold cross-validation and stratified sampling scheme is adopted to investigate the classification performances of different machine learning methods and different sets of features. The empirical results reveal that our method obtains 0.88 +/- 0.04 classification accuracy, 0.87 +/- 0.06 sensitivity, and 0.88 +/- 0.08 specificity for test data when including the coefficients of the ellipse and cashew-shaped equations.

However, they are computationally intensive, since they have to optimize an objective function independently for each pair of surfaces. In this paper, we present a fast learning-based algorithm that makes use of the recent development in spherical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spherical cortical surface registration. Given a set of surface pairs without supervised information such as ground truth deformation fields or anatomical landmarks, we formulate the registration as a parametric function and learn its parameters by enforcing the feature similarity between one surface and the other one warped by the estimated deformation field using the function. Then, given a new pair of surfaces, we can quickly infer the spherical deformation field registering one surface to the other one. We model this parametric function using three orthogonal Spherical U-Nets and use spherical transform layers to warp the spherical surfaces, while imposing smoothness constraints on the deformation field. All the layers in the network are well-defined and differentiable, thus the parameters can be effectively learned. We show that our method achieves accurate cortical alignment results on 102 subjects, comparable to two state-of-the-art methods: Spherical Demons and MSM, while runs much faster.",Cortical surface registration; Spherical U-Net,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

However, dynamic intensity changes, low tissue contrast, and small subcortical size of infant brain MR images make subcortical segmentation a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a spatial context guided, coarse-to-fine deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for accurate infant subcortical segmentation. At the coarse stage, we propose a signed distance map (SDM) learning UNet (SDM-UNet) to predict SDMs from the original multi-modal images, including T1w, T2w, and T1w/T2w images. By doing this, the spatial context information, including the relative position information across different structures and the shape information of the segmented structures contained in the ground-truth SDMs, is used for supervising the SDM-UNet to remedy the bad influence from the low tissue contrast in infant brain MR images and generate high-quality SDMs. To improve the robustness to outliers, a Correntropy based loss is introduced in SDM-UNet to penalize the difference between the ground-truth SDMs and predicted SDMs in training. At the fine stage, the predicted SDMs, which contains spatial context information of subcortical structures, are combined with the multi-modal images, and then fed into a multi-source and multi-path UNet (M2-UNet) for delivering refined segmentation. We validate our method on an infant brain MR image dataset with 24 scans by evaluating the Dice ratio between our segmentation and the manual delineation.

Many technologies are reaching their sensitivity limit and new approaches need to be developed to overcome the currently irreducible technological challenges. The detrimental effect of the material budget and power consumption represents a very serious concern for a high-precision silicon vertex and tracking detectors. One of the most promising areas is CMOS sensors offering low mass and potentially radiation-hard technology for the future proton-proton and electron-positron colliders, intensity frontier and heavy-ion experiments. MPGDs have become a well-established technique in the fertile field of gaseous detectors; these will remain the primary choice whenever the large-area coverage with low material budget is required. Vacuum tube technology is inherently fast and new developments include advances in microchannel plates for photomultipliers with a potential for a picosecond-time resolution in large systems. Several novel concepts of picosecond-timing detectors will have numerous powerful applications in particle identification, pile-up rejection and event reconstruction, and serve numerous scientific goals. The story of modern calorimetry is a textbook example of physics research driving the development of an experimental method. Silicon photomultipliers have seen a rapid progress in the last decade, becoming the standard solution for scintillator-based devices. The integration of advanced electronics and data transmission functionalities plays an increasingly important role and needs to be addressed. Bringing the modern algorithmic advances from the field of machine learning from offline applications to online operations and trigger systems is another major challenge. The timescales spanned by future projects in particle physics, ranging from few years to many decades, constitute a challenge in itself, in addition to the complexity and diversity of the required accelerator and detector R&D.

Evaluation of genetic diversity, classification of plant genotypes, analysis of yield components, yield stability analysis, assessment of biotic and abiotic stresses, prediction of parental combinations in hybrid breeding programs, and analysis of in vitro-based biotechnological experiments are mainly performed by classical statistical methods. Despite successful applications, these classical statistical methods have low efficiency in analyzing data obtained from plant studies, as the genotype, environment, and their interaction (G x E) result in nondeterministic and nonlinear nature of plant characteristics. Large-scale data flow, including phenomics, metabolomics, genomics, and big data, must be analyzed for efficient interpretation of results affected by G x E. Nonlinear nonparametric machine learning techniques are more efficient than classical statistical models in handling large amounts of complex and nondeterministic information with ""multiple-independent variables versus multiple-dependent variables"" nature. Neural networks, partial least square regression, random forest, and support vector machines are some of the most fascinating machine learning models that have been widely applied to analyze nonlinear and complex data in both classical plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. High interpretive power of machine learning algorithms has made them popular in the analysis of plant complex multifactorial characteristics. The classification of different plant genotypes with morphological and molecular markers, modeling and predicting important quantitative characteristics of plants, the interpretation of complex and nonlinear relationships of plant characteristics, and predicting and optimizing of in vitro breeding methods are the examples of applications of machine learning in conventional plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. Precision agriculture is possible through accurate measurement of plant characteristics using imaging techniques and then efficient analysis of reliable extracted data using machine learning algorithms. Perfect interpretation of high-throughput phenotyping data is applicable through coupled machine learning-image processing. Some applied and potentially applicable capabilities of machine learning techniques in conventional and in vitro-based plant breeding studies have been discussed in this overview.

Recently, Compton cameras have attracted attention, owing to their wide energy range, which stretches from a few hundred keV to several MeV. In this study, we performed Compton camera image processing using four machine-learning (ML) techniques: dictionary learning, U-Net, SRGAN, and AUTOMAP. With these techniques, we tried to reduce the artifacts caused by the sparsity of statistics and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, these ML models were trained using image pairs reconstructed from high- and low-statistics images. As a result, we succeeded in generating images similar to the ground truth from low-statistics images.

Specifically, this article measures and codes learners' engagement by fusing and compiling clickstreams (e.g., response time), physiological data (e.g., eye-tracking, electroencephalography, electrodermal activity), and survey data (e.g., goal-orientation) to determine what configurations of those data explain when learners can attain high or medium/low learning performance. For the evaluation of the approach, an empirical study with 32 undergraduates was conducted. The analysis revealed six configurations that explain learners' high performance and three that explain learners' medium/low performance, driven by engagement measures coming from the multimodal data.

Non-parametric familiar alternatives to the Cox proportional hazard regression (CPH) model include survival trees that can automatically discover certain types of coy ariatc interactions according to the survival length. The aim of this research is to study FBI influential factors by applying survival trees.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 610 married women (aged 15-49 years), were selected from different regions of Tehran, Iran in the Winter and Spring of 2017. Classification and regression trees (CART) for the FBI survival tree were fitted by taking into consideration the predictors of each woman's age, age at first marriage, educational level, partner's educational level, activity, region, house ownership, kinship, partner's race, marriage time attitude, and expenditure using R packages.
Results: Since the PH assumption of the CPH model was not confirmed for the covariates of age at first marriage (P=0.001), kinship (P=0.000), partner's race (P=0.001), and marriage time attitude (P=0.042), the results of this model were not valid. Thus, a CART survival tree was fitted. The validity of the fitted model in assessing FBI was confirmed by the significant result of the log rank test (P<0.01) for the terminal nodes and the value of the separation measure, which was greater than 1. The fitted tree had 13 terminal nodes and the most vital FBI predictor was women's age. The longest FBI belonged to educated and employed women, ages 30-37 years.
Conclusion: Analysing patterns of birth spacing by selecting the appropriate statistical method provides important information for health policymakers. In order to formulate appropriate demographic policies, it is essential to take into consideration age, educational level and job status of the women, all of which have essential roles on their decision to have children.","Cox Proportional Hazards Model,First Birth Intervals,Machine Learning,Survival Analysis",Article,"ROYAN INST, PO BOX 19395-4644, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",Obstetrics & Gynecology,,0.567,"FERTILITY,IRAN",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FERTILITY & STERILITY,,

Using CT as the labeled source domain, our approach learns to segment multi-modal (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) MRI having no labeled data. Our approach uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to disentangle the image content from style. The VAE constrains the style feature encoding to match a universal prior (Gaussian) that is assumed to span the styles of all the source and target modalities. The extracted image style is converted into a latent style scaling code, which modulates the generator to produce multi-modality images according to the target domain code from the image content features. Finally, we introduce a joint distribution matching discriminator that combines the translated images with task-relevant segmentation probability maps to further constrain and regularize image-to-image (I2I) translations. We performed extensive comparisons to multiple state-of-the-art I2I translation and segmentation methods. Our approach resulted in the lowest average multi-domain image reconstruction error of 1.34±0.04. Our approach produced an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.85 for T1w and 0.90 for T2w MRI for multi-organ segmentation, which was highly comparable to a fully supervised MRI multi-organ segmentation network (DSC of 0.86 for T1w and 0.90 for T2w MRI).",Disentagled networks; Multi-domain translation; Unsupervised multi-modal MRI segmentation; abdominal organs,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive dataset was created and reported here to show the effects of material and process parameters on the die filling performance and the filling consistency.

In the current work, these two parameters are used as descriptors in the Gaussian process regression model to predict Tg. We investigate 60 samples with Tg values from 194 K to 440 K.

Accurate identification of erythema migrans allows for early diagnosis and treatment, which avoids the potential for later neurologic, rheumatologic, and cardiac complications of Lyme disease. We develop and test several deep learning models for detecting erythema migrans versus several other clinically relevant skin conditions, including cellulitis, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, lesions due to tick bites and insect bites, as well as non-pathogenic normal skin. We consider a set of clinically-relevant binary and multiclass classification problems of increasing complexity. We train the DL models on a combination of publicly available images and test on public images as well as images obtained in the clinical setting. We report performance metrics that measure agreement with a gold standard, as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. On public images, we find that the DL system has an accuracy ranging from 71.58% (and 95% error margin equal to 3.77%) for an 8-class problem of EM versus 7 other classes including other skin pathologies, insect bites and normal skin, to 94.23% (3.66%) for a binary problem of EM vs. non-pathological skin. On clinical images of affected individuals, the DL system has a sensitivity of 88.55% (2.39%). These results suggest that a DL system can help in prescreening and referring individuals to physicians for earlier diagnosis and treatment, in the presence of clinically relevant confusers, thereby reducing further complications and morbidity.","LYME-DISEASE,MACULAR DEGENERATION,MANIFESTATIONS,CLASSIFICATION,BORRELIOSIS,DIAGNOSIS",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"LYME-DISEASE,MACULAR,DEGENERATION,MANIFESTATIONS,CLASSIFICATION,BORRELIOSIS,DIAGNOSIS",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

The advent of portable and inexpensive markerless motion capture systems can improve assessment through objective joint kinematic analysis. The current study aimed to evaluate various machine learning models that used kinematic features from Kinect position data to classify a performer's Movement Competency Screen (MCS) score. A Kinect V2 sensor collected position data from 31 physically active males as they performed bilateral squat, forward lunge, and single-leg squat; and the movement quality was rated according to the MCS criteria. Features were extracted and selected from domain knowledge-based kinematic variables as model input. Multiclass logistic regression (MLR) was then performed to translate joint kinematics into MCS score. Performance indicators were calculated after a 10-fold cross validation of each model developed from Kinect-based kinematic variables. The analyses revealed that the models' sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 0.66 to 0.89, 0.58 to 0.86, and 0.74 to 0.85, respectively.

Early carotid plaque monitoring can help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Manual ultrasound plaque classification and characterization methods are time-consuming and can be imprecise due to significant variations in tissue characteristics. We report a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based plaque tissue classification and characterization system.
Methods: We hypothesize that symptomatic plaque is hypoechoic due to its large lipid core and minimal collagen, as well as its heterogeneous makeup. Meanwhile, asymptomatic plaque is hyperechoic due to its small lipid core, abundant collagen, and the fact that it is often calcified. We designed a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system consisting of three kinds of deep learning (DL) classification paradigms: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Visual Geometric Group-16 (VGG16), and transfer learning, (tCNN). DCNN was 3-D optimized by varying the number of CNN layers and data augmentation frameworks. The DL systems were benchmarked against four types of machine learning (ML) classification systems, and the CADx system was characterized using two novel strategies consisting of DL mean feature strength (MFS) and a bispectrum model using higher-order spectra.
Results: After balancing symptomatic and asymptomatic plaque classes, a five-fold augmentation process was applied, yielding 1000 carotid scans in each class. Then, using a K10 protocol (trained to test the ratio of 90%10%), tCNN and DCNN yielded accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) pairs of 83.33%, 0.833 (p < 0.0001) and 95.66%, 0.956 (p < 0.0001), respectively. DCNN was superior to ML by 7.01%. As part of the characterization process, the MFS of the symptomatic plaque was found to be higher compared to the asymptomatic plaque by 17.5% (p < 0.0001). A similar pattern was seen in the bispectrum, which was higher for symptomatic plaque by 5.4% (p < 0.0001). It took <2 s to perform the online CADx process on a supercomputer.
Conclusions: The performance order of the three AI systems was DCNN > tCNN > ML. Bispectrum-based on higher-order spectra proved a powerful paradigm for plaque tissue characterization. Overall, the AI-based systems offer a powerful solution for plaque tissue classification and characterization.","Atherosclerosis,Carotid plaque,ultrasound,symptomatic,Asymptomatic,Artificial intelligence,Machine learning,deep learning,Performance,Supercomputer,Accuracy,And speed",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,INTIMA-MEDIA,THICKNESS,TISSUE,CHARACTERIZATION,ATHEROSCLEROTIC,PLAQUE,STROKE,RISK,TEXTURE,FEATURES,DISEASE,STENOSIS,ACCURATE",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study, therefore, purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images.
Methods: A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
Results: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively.
Conclusion: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis.

99,A Deep Learning Framework for Hybrid Beamforming Without Instantaneous CSI Feedback,69,10,11743-11755,Elbir Ahmet M.,Elbir AM,Elbir AM,10.1109/TVT.2020.3017652,Duzce University,"Hybrid beamformer design plays very crucial role in the next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Previous works assume the perfect channel state information (CSI) which results heavy feedback overhead. To lower complexity, channel statistics can be utilized such that only infrequent update of the channel information is needed. To reduce the complexity and provide robustness, in this work, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to deal with both hybrid beamforming and channel estimation. For this purpose, we introduce three deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We assume that the base station (BS) has the channel statistics only and feeds the channel covariance matrix into a CNN to obtain the hybrid precoders. At the receiver, two CNNs are employed. The first one is used for channel estimation purposes and the another is employed to design the hybrid combiners. The proposed DL framework does not require the instantaneous feedback of the CSI at the BS. We have also investigated the online deployment of DL for channel estimation. We have shown that the proposed approach has higher spectral efficiency with comparison to the conventional techniques. The trained CNN structures do not need to be re-trained due to the changes in the propagation environment such as the deviations in the number of received paths and the fluctuations in the received path angles up to 4 degrees. Also, the proposed DL framework exhibits at least 10 times lower computational complexity as compared to the conventional optimization-based approaches.","Standards,Smoothing methods,Uncertainty,Bills of materials,Time measurement,Deep learning,online learning,channel estimation,hybrid precoding,instantaneous feedback",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Telecommunications,Transportation",,5.429,"MILLIMETER-WAVE,COMMUNICATIONS,MASSIVE,MIMO,SYSTEMS,CHANNEL,ESTIMATION,ANTENNA,SELECTION,COMBINER,DESIGN,PHASE,SHIFTERS,PRECODER,OPTIMIZATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10971,

Approach: The approach leverages digital biomarkers and recent advances in machine learning (ML) for mass AF diagnosis from overnight-hours of single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Four databases, totaling n = 3088 patients and p = 26 913 h of continuous single-channel electrocardiogram raw data were used. Three of the databases (n = 125, p = 2513) were used for training a ML model in recognizing AF events from beat-to-beat time series. Visit 1 of the sleep heart health study database (SHHS1, n = 2963, p = 24 400) was used as the test set to evaluate the feasibility of identifying prominent AF from polysomnographic recordings. By combining AF diagnosis history and a cardiologist's visual inspection of individuals suspected of having AF (n = 118), a total of 70 patients were diagnosed with prominent AF in SHHS1. Main results: Model prediction on SHHS1 showed an overall Se = 0.97, Sp = 0.99, NPV = 0.99 and PPV = 0.67 in classifying individuals with or without prominent AF. PPV was non-inferior (p = 0.03) for individuals with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 15 versus AHI < 15. Over 22% of correctly identified prominent AF rhythm cases were not previously documented as AF in SHHS1. Significance: Individuals with prominent AF can be automatically diagnosed from an overnight single-channel ECG recording, with an accuracy unaffected by the presence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. This approach enables identifying a large proportion of AF individuals that were otherwise missed by regular care.","medicine during sleep,atrial fibrillation,digital biomarkers,machine learning,obstructive sleep apnea",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,2.866,STROKE,PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14686,
