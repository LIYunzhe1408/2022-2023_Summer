1,Targeted transfer learning to improve performance in small medical physics datasets,47,12,6246-6256,"Romero Miguel,Interian Yannet,Solberg Timothy,Valdes Gilmer","Romero M,Interian Y,Solberg T,Valdes G",Interian Y,10.1002/mp.14507,University of San Francisco,"Purpose To perform an in-depth evaluation of current state of the art techniques in training neural networks to identify appropriate approaches in small datasets.
Method In total, 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images from the NIH ChestXray14 dataset were used in our analysis. Two tasks were studied: unbalanced multi-label classification of 14 diseases, and binary classification of pneumonia vs non-pneumonia. All datasets were randomly split into training, validation, and testing (70%, 10%, and 20%). Two popular convolution neural networks (CNNs), DensNet121 and ResNet50, were trained using PyTorch. We performed several experiments to test: (a) whether transfer learning using pretrained networks on ImageNet are of value to medical imaging/physics tasks (e.g., predicting toxicity from radiographic images after training on images from the internet), (b) whether using pretrained networks trained on problems that are similar to the target task helps transfer learning (e.g., using X-ray pretrained networks for X-ray target tasks), (c) whether freeze deep layers or change all weights provides an optimal transfer learning strategy, (d) the best strategy for the learning rate policy, and (e) what quantity of data is needed in order to appropriately deploy these various strategies (N = 50 to N = 77 880).
Results In the multi-label problem, DensNet121 needed at least 1600 patients to be comparable to, and 10 000 to outperform, radiomics-based logistic regression. In classifying pneumonia vs non-pneumonia, both CNN and radiomics-based methods performed poorly when N < 2000. For small datasets ( < 2000), however, a significant boost in performance (>15% increase on AUC) comes from a good selection of the transfer learning dataset, dropout, cycling learning rate, and freezing and unfreezing of deep layers as training progresses. In contrast, if sufficient data are available (>35 000), little or no tweaking is needed to obtain impressive performance. While transfer learning using X-ray images from other anatomical sites improves performance, we also observed a similar boost by using pretrained networks from ImageNet. Having source images from the same anatomical site, however, outperforms every other methodology, by up to 15%. In this case, DL models can be trained with as little as N = 50.
Conclusions While training DL models in small datasets (N < 2000) is challenging, no tweaking is necessary for bigger datasets (N > 35 000). Using transfer learning with images from the same anatomical site can yield remarkable performance in new tasks with as few as N = 50. Surprisingly, we did not find any advantage for using images from other anatomical sites over networks that have been trained using ImageNet. This indicates that features learned may not be as general as currently believed, and performance decays rapidly even by just changing the anatomical site of the images.","deep learning,machine learning,small datasets",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"RADIATION,PNEUMONITIS,MACHINE,RADIOTHERAPY,PREDICTION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06761,

FAST images can often be difficult to interpret and requires operators to be properly trained. Traditionally, skill is assessed by direct observation from experts, which is expensive and error prone. This project aims to use deep learning to provide automated skills assessment for FAST exams. Modified I3D networks, a type of modern neural network with a focus on action-based items, were retrained for this purpose. First, a network to identify the skill level of the users from all the ultrasound videos was trained using FAST videos of each vital region divided by novice, intermediate and expert users. Following this, 4 networks corresponding to skill level identification in each region were trained using the previously constructed model. The model's performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results found a testing accuracy of 82.6% for skills assessment using the modified I3D networks. These results are an improvement over the previous results for skill level evaluation, implying potential use of an I3D network for evaluating skill level from ultrasound video in the future with the proper finetuning.","Diagnostic ultrasound,skills assessment,deep learning",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,,COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-IMAGING AND VISUALIZATION,,

In this study, a deep learning-based approach was developed for automatic intraprostatic lesion segmentation in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) images contributing to clinical practice.
Methods Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging images from 136 patient cases were collected from our institution, and all these cases contained suspicious lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score >= 4. The contours of the lesion and prostate were manually created on axial T2-weighted (T2W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images to provide the ground truth data. Then a multiple branch UNet (MB-UNet) was proposed for the segmentation of an indistinct target in multi-modality MRI images. An encoder module was designed with three branches for the three MRI modalities separately, to fully extract the high-level features provided by different MRI modalities; an input module was added by using three sub-branches for three consecutive image slices, to consider the contour consistency among different image slices; deep supervision strategy was also integrated into the network to speed up the convergency of the network and improve the performance. The probability maps of the background, normal prostate and lesion were output by the network to generate the segmentation of the lesion, and the performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as the main metric.
Results A total of 162 lesions were contoured on 652 image slices, with 119 lesions in the peripheral zone, 38 in the transition zone, four in the central zone and one in the anterior fibromuscular stroma. All prostates were also contoured on 1,264 image slices. As for the segmentation of lesions in the testing set, MB-UNet achieved a per case DSC of 0.6333, specificity of 0.9993, sensitivity of 0.7056; and global DSC of 0.7205, specificity of 0.9993, sensitivity of 0.7409. All the three deep learning strategies adopted in this study contributed to the performance promotion of the MB-UNet. Missing the DWI modality would degrade the segmentation performance more markedly compared with the other two modalities.
Conclusions A deep learning-based approach with proposed MB-UNet was developed to automatically segment suspicious lesions in mpMRI images. This study makes it feasible to adopt boosting intraprostatic lesions in clinical practice to achieve better outcomes.","boosting radiotherapy,deep learning,intraprostatic lesion segmentation,multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging,multiple branch UNet (MB&#8208,UNet)",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"PROSTATE-CANCER,TUMOR,DELINEATION,BOOST",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,
5,Is sleep deficit associated with infertility and recurrent pregnancy losses? Results from a prospective cohort study,100,2,302-313,"Stocker Linden Jane,Cagampang Felino Ramon,Lu Shilong,Ladyman Tom,Cheong Ying Chin","Stocker LJ,Cagampang FR,Lu SL,Ladyman T,Cheong YC",Stocker LJ,10.1111/aogs.14008,University of Southampton,"Introduction Biological rhythms, the innate cycle of changes in the body's physiological functions, are circadian if they have a 24-hour period. It is known that sleep is a key feature of human circadian rhythm but the relationship between sleep and female fertility is largely unknown. This paucity of research is surprising given that circadian rhythms are paramount to human physiology and sleep is related to major female reproductive events. This study was designed to investigate whether there is a difference between the sleep and activity parameters of women with poor reproductive outcome compared with healthy, fertile parous women (comparator group) using subjective (questionnaires) and objective (actigraphy and light exposure) measures.
Material and methods A prospective cohort study in a tertiary in vitro fertilization referral centre in the UK; composed of three study groups: women diagnosed with recurrent implantation failure, women with recurrent miscarriage (RM) and a comparison group (fertile women without endometrial pathology). Comparison women were selected gynaecology patients without endometrial disease (ie perineal complaints or altruistic egg donors). Primary outcome was differences in objective length of sleep in each of the participant groups using actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were subjective sleep quality and quantity, using participant questionnaires, light exposure, and the feasibility of machine learning in activity-pattern interpretation.
Results Women with recurrent implantation failure slept daily on average for 7 hours 35 minutes (+/- 57 min), 53 minutes less than the comparison group (P = .03), although quality of their objective sleep, and quantity of their subjective sleep, were not significantly different. Women with recurrent miscarriage slept less that the comparison women (36 minutes less/night) but more than women with recurrent implantation failure (17 minutes more/night). No difference in light exposure was found between recurrent miscarriage and the recurrent implantation failure and comparison groups.
Conclusions This study demonstrates an objective observation of sleep time reduction in women with subfertility, although it is not yet clear if this association is casual. Given our increased understanding of the internal body clock and circadian rhythm on fertility, our observation warrants further investigation.","assisted reproduction,circadian rhythm,early pregnancy complications,infertility,recurrent implantation failure,recurrent miscarriage,reproductive endocrinology,sleep",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Obstetrics & Gynecology,,3.576,"CIRCADIAN,RHYTHMICITY,SHIFT,WORK,DURATION,POLYSOMNOGRAPHY,INSUFFICIENT,WAKEFULNESS,CALIBRATION,ACTIGRAPHY",ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/444458/1/Does_a_sleep_deficit_Acta_R2_2_.docx,

Its accurate detection is a challenge since sometimes patients do not experience any prior alert to identify a seizure. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used for seizure detection, but these are usually of longer duration, and as a result, the behavior of the inherent data set is highly imbalanced. To detect seizures in such a scenario is a challenging task; using a typical classifier such as decision tree and decision forest can result in highly skewed class value (non-seizure), causing incorrect detection of epileptic patients. To solve this, a cost-sensitive learning method with a random forest was used. An algorithm that helps in seizure detection by penalizing the cost of a false negative concerning the duration of an EEG recording was proposed. The experimental results show that executing the classifier without penalty or inadequate penalties to the cost matrix is not a satisfactory solution. As a result, the algorithm provides up to 100% recall, which means all the seizure seconds are detected. The proposed method substantiates achieving higher actual seizure detection rates; the imposed penalty should be equal to the time duration of the EEG recordings (in seconds) for a patient. Hence, it can be potentially applied to the pre-consultation to the neurologist at the Outpatient Department for the actual seizure detection cases and refer them to the neurology department for further consultation.","Classification,Decision forest,Class imbalance,Cost-sensitive learning,Epilepsy,Seizure detection,Scalp EEG,Epilepsy monitoring unit",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Engineering,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM,,

Besides, the decision tree method was also used to execute the same mission for a comparison purpose. Twenty-eight groups of heating tests were conducted to validate the proposed ANN model. The ANN model behaved well in assessing explosive spalling of concrete, with a prediction accuracy of 82.1%.

Moreover, the fatty acid profile of a specific oil type can be mimicked by a mixture of 2 or more oil types. This has led to fraudulent oil adulteration and intentional mislabeling of edible oils threatening food safety and endangering public health. Here, we present a machine learning method to uncover fatty acid patterns discriminative for ten different plant oil types and their intra-variability. We also describe a supervised end-to-end learning method that can be generalized to oil composition of any given mixtures. Trained on a large number of simulated oil mixtures, independent test dataset validation demonstrates that the model has a 50(th) percentile absolute error between 1.4-1.8% and a 90(th) percentile error of 4-5.4% for any 3-way mixtures of the ten oil types. The deep learning model can also be further refined with on-line training. Because oil-producing plants have diverse geographical origins and hence slightly varying fatty acid profiles, an online-training method provides also a way to capture useful knowledge presently unavailable. Our method allows the ability to control product quality, determining the fair price of purchased oils and in-turn allowing health-conscious consumers the future of accurate labeling. Fraudulent adulteration of edible oils is based on the fact that their characteristic fatty acid profile can be mimicked with mixtures of other oil types. Here, the authors use a deep learning method to uncover fatty acid patterns discriminative for ten different plant oil types and to discern composition of mixtures.","VEGETABLE-OILS,RAPID IDENTIFICATION,QUANTIFICATION,CLASSIFICATION,SPECTROSCOPY",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"VEGETABLE-OILS,RAPID,IDENTIFICATION,QUANTIFICATION,CLASSIFICATION,SPECTROSCOPY",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19137-6.pdf,

Encoded at this length scale can be a diversity of spatiotemporally fluctuating dynamics that are critical to function, from phase transition of nanoparticle self-assemblies as reconfigurable devices and morphology development of polymer membranes as separation layers for wastewater reclamation to the transformation of membrane proteins as the gatekeeper for mass and information flow in living cells. Extensive research efforts have thus been focused on resolving and understanding such dynamics that typically occur in a liquid medium. The proliferation of methods such as liquid-phase atomic force microscopy, cryogenic electron microscopy, and super-resolution optical microscopy has greatly expanded our knowledge in the structure or dynamics of soft matter at the nanoscale. However, these techniques do not offer direct real-space, real-time imaging of the structural and functional dynamics in a native liquid environment with nanometer resolution. This lack of experimental dataset also renders predictive modeling or computation difficult. As a result, how nanoscale morphology and interaction of the constituents affect the self-organization pathways or broadly collective structural evolution, such as interconversion among metastable states, as well as the involved energy measures remains poorly understood.
In this Account, we present our recent efforts in adapting and using a nanoscopic cinematography method relatively new to the soft matter community, liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to study the self-organization pathways of nanoscale colloidal matter. Liquid-phase TEM has opened a new avenue to investigate materials chemistry questions, such as electrochemistry and catalysis, nanomaterial diffusion and growth, and nucleation of minerals and atomic crystals. Applying it to soft matter systems involves tackling complications, including the electron beam's modification of nanoscale colloidal interaction and the substrate effect present in the liquid chamber, for both of which we highlight achievements of control. In addition, we discuss a series of first-time imaging of self-organization pathways of nanoparticle systems, accessible only by liquid-phase TEM. At low nanoparticle concentrations, chaining of nanoparticles occurs following quantitatively the kinetic laws of polymerization. This analogy originated from local collision and pairwise interaction, which can be directly mapped from trajectory sampling. At high nanoparticle concentrations, collective phase behaviors such as crystallization and coalescence are observed with single-particle resolution, allowing for the charting of phase coordinates and thermodynamic quantities based on statistical mechanics principles. We also discuss the general applicability of these methods. Lastly, toward taking live videos of organic soft matter at the nanoscale, we highlight recent instrumental developments, including machine learning based liquid-phase TEM video analysis to account for low signal-to-noise ratio data sets and low-dose electron tomography to resolve three-dimensional morphologies. We foresee that the examples, techniques, and understandings pinpoint the beginning of a paradigm shift in soft matter studies, where knowledge at the nanoscale can be derived from direct ""seeing"".","NANOCRYSTALS,VISUALIZATION,GROWTH,AU,PATHWAYS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Materials Science",,,"NANOCRYSTALS,VISUALIZATION,GROWTH,AU,PATHWAYS",ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/accountsmr.0c00013,

Various RAST techniques have been reported for tracking bacterial phenotypes, including size, shape, motion, and redox state. However, they still require bulky and expensive instruments- which hinder their application in resource-limited environments-and/or utilize labeling reagents which can interfere with antibiotics and add to the total cost. Furthermore, the existing RAST methods do not address the potential gradual adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics, which can lead to a false diagnosis. In this work, we present a RAST approach by leveraging machine learning to analyze time-resolved dynamic laser speckle imaging (DLSI) results. DLSI captures the change in bacterial motion in response to antibiotic treatments. Our method accurately predicts the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin and gentamicin for a model strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli K-12) in 60 min, compared to 6 h using the currently FDA-approved phenotype-based RAST technique. In addition to ampicillin (a beta-lactam) and gentamicin (an aminoglycoside), we studied the effect of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) on E. coli K-12.

It is highly prevalent in developing countries and is growing in prevalence in developed countries mostly because of chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B and C and alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the prevalence of cirrhosis may be highly underestimated because early stages are asymptomatic and current early detection methods are inadequate. Here, we evaluate the potential of a set of novel cirrhotic protein biomarkers, including soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer, for early detection of cirrhosis in a multiplexed assay using our giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor arrays. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers, individually and in combination, using multivariate logistic regression and random forest in a blinded proof-of-concept retrospective case-controlled study. The biomarkers in combination exhibited high diagnostic performance in both logistic regression and random forest models, with an area under the curve of 0.98 (0.94-1.00). In addition, the combination of biomarkers resulted in a high sensitivity of 0.97 (0.95-1.00) and a high specificity of 1.00. We showed that the diagnostic performance of our novel set of cirrhotic protein biomarkers on our multiplexed GMR sensor arrays is higher than the performance of currently used clinical biomarkers and factors (i.e., age, sex, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, etc.).

For practical implementations of PPGI, a region of interest has to be detected automatically in real time. As the neonates' body proportions differ significantly from adults, existing approaches may not be used in a straightforward way, and color-based skin detection requires RGB data, thus prohibiting the use of less-intrusive near-infrared (NIR) acquisition. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based method for segmentation of neonatal video data. We augmented an existing encoder-decoder semantic segmentation method with a modified version of the ResNet-50 encoder. This reduced the computational time by a factor of 7.5, so that 30 frames per second can be processed at 960 x 576 pixels. The method was developed and optimized on publicly available databases with segmentation data from adults. For evaluation, a comprehensive dataset consisting of RGB and NIR video recordings from 29 neonates with various skin tones recorded in two NICUs in Germany and India was used. From all recordings, 643 frames were manually segmented. After pre-training the model on the public adult data, parts of the neonatal data were used for additional learning and left-out neonates are used for cross-validated evaluation. On the RGB data, the head is segmented well (82% intersection over union, 88% accuracy), and performance is comparable with those achieved on large, public, non-neonatal datasets. On the other hand, performance on the NIR data was inferior. By employing data augmentation to generate additional virtual NIR data for training, results could be improved and the head could be segmented with 62% intersection over union and 65% accuracy. The method is in theory capable of performing segmentation in real time and thus it may provide a useful tool for future PPGI applications.","Image processing,Deep learning,Semantic segmentation,Camera-based monitoring,Nicu",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,2.61,"PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY,RATES",MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679364,

This is a problem of large dimensionality. To solve it, the neural network approach is used. This enables creation of architectured materials with tunable elastic anisotropy. A chiral element combining large twist with additional anisotropy requirements is presented as an example of successful machine-learning-based optimization of beam lattices proposed.","architectured materials,elastic anisotropies,lattice materials,machine learning",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",Materials Science,,3.746,,ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000125818/124490043,

The integration of graphene in the fabrication process of electronic devices requires the cost-effective and environmentally friendly production of graphene on dielectric substrates, but current approaches can only produce graphene on metal catalysts. Sustainable manufacturing of graphene should also conserve the catalyst and reaction gases, but today the metal catalysts are typically dissolved after synthesis. Progress toward these objectives is hindered by the hundreds of coupled synthesis parameters that can strongly affect CVD of low-dimensional materials and poor communication in the published literature of the rich experimental data that exists in individual laboratories. We report here on a platform, ""graphene recipes for synthesis of high quality material"" (Gr-ResQ: pronounced graphene rescue), which includes powerful new tools for data-driven graphene synthesis. At the core of Gr-ResQ is a crowd-sourced database of CVD synthesis recipes and associated experimental results. The database captures similar to 300 parameters ranging from synthesis conditions such as a catalyst material and preparation steps, to ambient lab temperature and reactor details, as well as resulting Raman spectra and microscopy images. These parameters are carefully selected to unlock the potential of machine-learning models to advance synthesis. A suite of associated tools enable fast, automated, and standardized processing of Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy images. To facilitate community-based efforts, Gr-ResQ provides tools for cyber-physical collaborations among research groups, allowing experiments to be designed, executed, and analyzed by different teams. Gr-ResQ also allows publication and discovery of recipes via the Materials Data Facility, which assigns each recipe a unique identifier when published and collects parameters in a search index. We envision that this holistic approach to data-driven synthesis can accelerate CVD recipe discovery and production control and open opportunities for advancing not only graphene but also many other 1D and 2D materials.","graphene,robotic synthesis,materials data,recipes,machine learning,Raman spectroscopy,nanomanufacturing",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,5.1,"SINGLE-CRYSTAL,GRAPHENE,LARGE-AREA,SYNTHESIS,HIGH-QUALITY,GROWTH,FILMS,OXYGEN,NETWORKS,SUPERCAPACITOR,SUBSTRATE,OXIDE",ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS,https://osf.io/7mwgd/download,

However, in spite of these successes, these methods focus exclusively on improving the accuracy of point predictions without assessing the quality of their outputs. Knowing how much confidence there is in a prediction is essential for gaining clinicians' trust in the technology. In this article, we propose an uncertainty estimation framework, called MC-DropWeights, to approximate Bayesian inference in DL by imposing a Bernoulli distribution on the incoming or outgoing weights of the model, including neurones. We demonstrate that by decomposing predictive probabilities into two main types of uncertainty, aleatoric and epistemic, using the Bayesian Residual U-Net (BRUNet) in image segmentation. Approximation methods in Bayesian DL suffer from the ""mode collapse"" phenomenon in variational inference. To address this problem, we propose a model which Ensembles of Monte-Carlo DropWeights by varying the DropWeights rate. In segmentation, we introduce a predictive uncertainty estimator, which takes the mean of the standard deviations of the class probabilities associated with every class. However, in classification, we need an alternative approach since the predictive probabilities from a forward pass through the model does not capture uncertainty. The entropy of the predictive distribution is a measure of uncertainty, but its exponential depends on sample size. The plug-in estimate in mutual information is subject to sampling bias. We propose Jackknife resampling, to correct for sample bias, which improves estimating uncertainty quality in image classification. We demonstrate that our deep ensemble MC-DropWeights method, using the bias-corrected estimator produces an equally good or better result in both quantified uncertainty estimation and quality of uncertainty estimates than approximate Bayesian neural networks in practice.","bias-corrected uncertainty estimation,classification,deep learning,dropweights,ensembles,medical image segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Computer Science,,2.016,BIAS,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/21904/2/FullText.pdf,

The low resolution and existence of large number of reflections in endoscopy images are the major problems in the automatic detection of objects. To address these issues, we presented a novel framework based on the convolutional neural networks. The proposed approach consists of three major parts. First, a deep learning (DL)-based image evaluation method is used to classify the input images into two groups, namely, specular highlights and weakly illuminated groups. Second, the specular highlight is detected using the DL-based method, and the reflected areas are recovered through a patch-based restoration operation. Lastly, gamma correction with optimized reflectance and illumination estimation is adopted to enhance the weakly illuminated images. The proposed method is compared against the existing ones, and the experimental results demonstrate that the former outperforms the latter in terms of subjective and objective assessments. This finding indicates that the proposed approach can serve as a potential tool for improving the quality of the endoscopy images used to examine internal body organs.","Endoscopy,Image restoration,Image enhancement,Specular highlights,Weak illuminance",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,4.602,SPACE,APPLIED INTELLIGENCE,,

We explore the machine-learnability of exchange spin coupling beyond linear regression, which has not been studied yet. We employ Gaussian process regression, since it can potentially deal with small training sets (as likely associated with the rather complex molecular structures required for exploring spin coupling) and since it provides uncertainty estimates (""error bars"") along with predicted values. We compare a range of descriptors and kernels for 257 small dicopper complexes and find that a simple descriptor based on chemical intuition, consisting only of copper-bridge angles and copper-copper distances, clearly outperforms several more sophisticated descriptors when it comes to extrapolating toward larger experimentally relevant complexes. Exchange spin coupling is similarly easy to learn as the polarizability, while learning dipole moments is much harder. The strength of the sophisticated descriptors lies in their ability to linearize structure-property relationships, to the point that a simple linear ridge regression performs just as well as the kernel-based machine-learning model for our small dicopper data set. The superior extrapolation performance of the simple descriptor is unique to exchange spin coupling, reinforcing the crucial role of choosing a suitable descriptor and highlighting the interesting question of the role of chemical intuition vs systematic or automated selection of features for machine learning in chemistry and material science.","TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES,ZETA VALENCE QUALITY,CORRELATION-ENERGY,BASIS-SETS,MACHINE,DISCOVERY,DESIGN,ANTIFERROMAGNETISM,COMMUNICATION,STRATEGIES",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,2.725,"TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES,ZETA,VALENCE,QUALITY,CORRELATION-ENERGY,BASIS-SETS,MACHINE,DISCOVERY,DESIGN,ANTIFERROMAGNETISM,COMMUNICATION,STRATEGIES",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A,https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/60c74df1f96a00b10a287a1e/original/exchange-spin-coupling-from-gaussian-process-regression.pdf,

From these maps, a gray-level cooccurrence matrix algorithm was used to extract texture features, and a scale-invariant feature transform algorithm was used to derive novel computer vision-based features. In total, 25 features were obtained, and the importance of each feature in diagnosis was evaluated using a random forest model. Two classifiers were assessed on two different classification tasks. A support vector machine model was found to be optimal for distinguishing normal from abnormal tissue, with 94.7% sensitivity and 94.0% specificity, while a random forest model performed optimally in further differentiating abnormal tissues (i.e., cancerous tissue and adenomatous polyp) with 86.9% sensitivity and 85.0% specificity.

The major difficulty when employing machine-learning-based surrogate models is the shortage of training data, contributing to the huge simulation costs. To derive a highly accurate surrogate model using only a small amount of training data, we increase the number of training instances by dividing the large-scale simulation results into 3D images of middle-scale filler morphologies and corresponding regional stresses. The images include fringe regions to reflect the influence of the filler constituents outside the core regions. The resultant surrogate model provides higher prediction accuracy than that trained only by images of the entire region.

However, this innovative approach suffers some limitations. A primary one is the nonuniqueness problem, which can prevent ML algorithms from properly converging because vastly different designs produce nearly identical spectra. Here, we introduce a mixture density network (MDN) approach, which models the design parameters as multimodal probability distributions instead of discrete values, allowing the algorithms to converge in cases of nonuniqueness without sacrificing degenerate solutions. We apply our MDN technique to inversely design two types of multilayer photonic structures consisting of thin films of oxides, which present a significant challenge for conventional ML algorithms due to a high degree of nonuniqueness in their optical properties. In the 10-layer case, the MDN can handle transmission spectra with high complexity and under varying illumination conditions. The 4-layer case tends to show a stronger multimodal character, with secondary modes indicating alternative solutions for a target spectrum. The shape of the distributions gives valuable information for postprocessing and about the uncertainty in the predictions, which is not available with deterministic networks. Our approach provides an effective solution to the inverse design of photonic structures and yields more optimal searches for the structures with high degeneracy and spectral complexity.","deep learning,artificial neural networks,multilayer structures,nanophotonics,inverse design,nonuniqueness",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Optics,Physics",,7.718,NANOPHOTONICS,ACS PHOTONICS,,

First, we trained a deep neural network (DNN) in an end-to-end fashion by directly feeding the surface temperature measurements to the DNN. Second, we turned the surface temperature measurements into virtual waves (a recently developed concept in thermography), which we then fed to the DNN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, we implemented a data generator and created a dataset comprising a total of 100000 simulated temperature measurement images. With the objective of determining a suitable baseline, we investigated several state-of-the-art model-based reconstruction methods, including Abel transformation, curvelet denoising, and time- and frequency-domain synthetic aperture focusing techniques. Additionally, a physical phantom was created to support evaluation on completely unseen real-world data. The results of several experiments suggest that both the end-to-end and the hybrid approach outperformed the baseline in terms of reconstruction accuracy. The end-to-end approach required the least amount of domain knowledge and was the most computationally efficient one. The hybrid approach required extensive domain knowledge and was more computationally expensive than the end-to-end approach. However, the virtual waves served as meaningful features that convert the complex task of the end-to-end reconstruction into a less demanding undertaking. This in turn yielded better reconstructions with the same number of training samples compared to the end-to-end approach. Additionally, it allowed more compact network architectures and use of prior knowledge, such as sparsity and non-negativity. The proposed method is suitable for non-destructive testing (NDT) in 2D where the amplitudes along the objects are considered to be constant (e.g., for metallic wires). To encourage the development of other deep-learning-based reconstruction techniques, we release both the synthetic and the real-world datasets along with the implementation of the deep learning methods to the research community.","APERTURE,MODEL",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"APERTURE,MODEL",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0020404,

PETmid Delta SUVmean response class prediction performance trended higher in MTVlo (AUC = 0.83-0.88) compared to MTVhi (AUC = 0.44-0.58, Friedmanp= 0.052). Models were more sensitive to MTV/MTV cluster regions (Friedmanp= 0.026) than feature sets/algorithms (Wilcoxon signed-rankp= 0.36). Top-ranked radiomic features included GLZSM-LZHGE (large-zone-high-SUV), GTSDM-CP (cluster-prominence), GTSDM-CS (cluster-shade) and NGTDM-CNT (contrast). Top-ranked features were consistent between MTVhi and MTVlo cluster pairs but varied between MTVhi-MTVlo clusters, reflecting distinct regional radiomic phenotypes.

We introduced a new self-derived organ attention deep learning network for combined CT to MRI image-to-image translation (I2I) and MRI segmentation, all trained as an end-to-end network. The expert segmentations available on CT scans were combined with the I2I translated pseudo MR images to train the MRI segmentation network. Once trained, the MRI segmentation network alone is required. We introduced an organ attention discriminator that constrains the CT to MR generator to synthesize pseudo MR images that preserve organ geometry and appearance statistics as in real MRI. The I2I translation network training was regularized using the organ attention discriminator, global image-matching discriminator, and cycle consistency losses. MRI segmentation training was regularized by using cross-entropy loss. Segmentation performance was compared against multiple domain adaptation-based segmentation methods using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance at the 95th percentile (HD95). All networks were trained using 85 unlabeled T2-weighted fat suppressed (T2wFS) MRIs and 96 expert-segmented CT scans. Performance upper-limit was based on fully supervised MRI training done using the 85 T2wFS MRI with expert segmentations. Independent evaluation was performed on 77 MRIs never used in training.

However, current computer-aided technologies are mostly focused on single-needle digitization, while manual digitization is labor intensive and time consuming. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based workflow for fast automatic multi-needle digitization, including needle shaft detection and needle tip detection. The major workflow is composed of two components: a large margin mask R-CNN model (LMMask R-CNN), which adopts the lager margin loss to reformulate Mask R-CNN for needle shaft localization, and a needle based density-based spatial clustering of application with noise algorithm which integrates priors to model a needle in an iteration for a needle shaft refinement and tip detections. Besides, we use the skipping connection in neural network architecture to improve the supervision in hidden layers. Our workflow was evaluated on 23 patients who underwent US-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) prostrate brachytherapy with 339 needles being tested in total. Our method detected 98% of the needles with 0.091 +/- 0.043 mm shaft error and 0.330 +/- 0.363 mm tip error. Compared with only using Mask R-CNN and only using LMMask R-CNN, the proposed method gains a significant improvement on both shaft error and tip error. The proposed method automatically digitizes needles per patient with in a second.

In a second step, two machine learning methods (logistic regression with elastic net regularization and random forest regression with SHAP feature importance metric) are used to highlight measurement features that are common among many of the outlying data points. Based on this analysis, penalty uncertainties are added to the experimental covariances of outlying data points that have outlier measurement features and are put through the generalized-least-squares evaluation.

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been adopted to solve the inverse problem of predicting delamination parameters of the delamination from natural frequency shifts. In this article, a delamination detection methodology is proposed based on the changes in multiple modes of frequencies to assess the interface, location, and size of delamination in fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Three types of machine learning algorithms including back propagation neural network, extreme learning machine, and support vector machine algorithm were adopted as inverse algorithms for assessment of the delamination parameters, with a special focus on the interface prediction. A theoretical model of fiber-reinforced polymer beam with delamination under vibration was constructed to learn how the frequencies are affected by the delaminations (""forward problem"") and to generate a database of ""frequency shifts versus delamination parameters"" to be used in machine learning algorithms for delamination prediction (""inverse problem""). Multiple carbon/epoxy fiber-reinforced polymer beam specimens were manufactured and measured by a laser scanning Doppler vibrometer to extract the modal frequencies. Numerical and experimental verification results have shown that support vector machine has the best prediction performance among the three machine learning algorithms, with high prediction accuracy and only requiring a small number of samples. For predicting the interface of delamination which is a discrete variable, support vector machine classification has observed better prediction accuracy and requiring less running time than regression. This study is one of the first to prove the applicability of support vector machine for structural health monitoring of delamination damage in fiber-reinforced polymer composites and has the potential to improve the prediction capability of machine learning algorithms. Another significant outcome of the study is that the interface of delamination has been predicted accurately with support vector machine.","Structural health monitoring,delamination detection,fiber-reinforced polymer,natural frequency,machine learning,support vector machine",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,5.861,"DAMAGE,DETECTION,CLASSIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION,IMPEDANCE,FEATURES",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

Its diagnosis is remarkably challenging due to the absence of a biomarker or gold standard diagnostic test. This leads to a low agreement between clinicians, with up to 50% of cases being misdiagnosed and diagnostic delays extending up to 10.1 y. We developed a deep learning algorithmic platform, DystoniaNet, to automatically identify and validate a microstructural neural network biomarker for dystonia diagnosis from raw structural brain MRIs of 612 subjects, including 392 patients with three different forms of isolated focal dystonia and 220 healthy controls. DystoniaNet identified clusters in corpus callosum, anterior and posterior thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior temporal and superior orbital gyri as the biomarker components. These regions are known to contribute to abnormal interhemispheric information transfer, heteromodal sensorimotor processing, and executive control of motor commands in dystonia pathophysiology. The DystoniaNet-based biomarker showed an overall accuracy of 98.8% in diagnosing dystonia, with a referral of 3.5% of cases due to diagnostic uncertainty. The diagnostic decision by DystoniaNet was computed in 0.36 s per subject. DystoniaNet significantly outperformed shallow machine-learning algorithms in benchmark comparisons, showing nearly a 20% increase in its diagnostic performance. Importantly, the microstructural neural network biomarker and its DystoniaNet platform showed substantial improvement over the current 34% agreement on dystonia diagnosis between clinicians. The translational potential of this biomarker is in its highly accurate, interpretable, and generalizable performance for enhanced clinical decision-making.","dystonia,biomarker,machine learning,brain MRI",Article,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES, 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,12.291,"VOXEL-BASED,MORPHOMETRY,SPASMODIC,DYSPHONIA,CONSENSUS,STATEMENT,CERVICAL,DYSTONIA,TASK,ACTIVATION,PHENOTYPE,GENOTYPE,DELAYS",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/42/26398.full.pdf,

Discovering a method for extracting valuable information from medical images and integrating that information closely with medical treatment has recently become a major topic of interest. Because obtaining large volumes of breast lesion ultrasound image data is difficult, transfer learning is usually employed to obtain benign and malignant classification of breast lesions. However, because of blurred unclear regions of interest in breast lesion ultrasound images and severe speckle noise interference, convolutional neural networks have proven ineffective in extracting features, thus providing unreliable classification results. Methods This study employs image decomposition to obtain fuzzy enhanced and bilateral filtered images to enrich input information of breast lesions. Fuzzy enhanced, bilateral filtered, and original ultrasound images comprise multifeature data, which are presented as inputs to a pre-trained model to realize knowledge fusion. Therefore, effective features of breast lesions are extracted and then used to train fully connected layers with ground truths provided by a doctor to accomplish the classification. Results A pre-trained VGG16 model was used to extract features from multifeature data, and these features were fused to train the fully connected layers to realize classification. The performance score reported is as follows: accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 88%, F1 score of 0.93, and AUC of 0.97. Conclusions Compared with using a single original ultrasound image for feature extraction, multifeature data based on image decomposition enables the pre-trained model to extract more relevant features, thereby providing better classification results than those from traditional transfer learning techniques.","bilateral filtering,breast lesion ultrasound images,feature extraction,fuzzy enhancement,transfer learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,,MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Due to the poor scaling and high computational cost intrinsic to QM calculations, one has to either sacrifice accuracy or time when performing large-scale atomic simulations. The battle to find a better compromise between accuracy and speed has been central to the development of new theoretical methods.
The recent advances of machine-learning (ML)-based large-scale atomic simulations has shown great promise to the benefit of many branches of chemistry. Instead of solving the Schrodinger equation directly, ML-based simulations rely on a large data set of accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) and complex numerical models to predict the total energy. These simulations feature both a high speed and a high accuracy for computing large systems. Due to the lack of a physical foundation in numerical models, ML models are often frustrated in their predictivity and robustness, which are key to applications. Focusing on these concerns, here we overview the recent advances in ML methodologies for atomic simulations on three key aspects. Namely, the generation of a representative data set, the extensity of ML models, and the continuity of data representation. While global optimization methods are the natural choice for building a representative data set, the stochastic surface walking method is shown to provide the desired PES sampling for both minima and transition regions on the PES. The current ML models generally utilize local geometrical descriptors as an input and consider the total energy as the sum of atomic energies. There are many flavors of data descriptors and ML models, but the applications for material and reaction predictions are still limited, not least because of the difficulty to train the associated vast global data sets. We show that our recently designed power-type structure descriptors together with a feed-forward neural network (NN) model are compatible with highly complex global PES data, which has led to a large family of global NN (G-NN) potentials. Two recent applications of G-NN potentials in material and reaction simulations are selected to illustrate how ML-based atomic simulations can help the discovery of new materials and reactions.","PHASE-TRANSITION,STRUCTURE PREDICTION,CHEMICAL UNIVERSE,GLUCOSE PYROLYSIS,WALKING METHOD,OPTIMIZATION,MODEL,SELECTIVITY,MOLECULES,CHEMISTRY",Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,22.732,"PHASE-TRANSITION,STRUCTURE,PREDICTION,CHEMICAL,UNIVERSE,GLUCOSE,PYROLYSIS,WALKING,METHOD,OPTIMIZATION,MODEL,SELECTIVITY,MOLECULES,CHEMISTRY",ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,,

Using this inventory map, the hydrogen inventory in the divertor is easily derived for any type of scenario. Here, the case of a detached ITER scenario with inputs from the SOLPS code is presented. For this scenario, the hydrogen inventory per monoblock is highly dependent of surface temperature and ranges from 1018 to 6x1019 H after a 107 s exposure. The inventory evolves as a power law of time and is lower at strike points where the surface temperature is high.

Here, we report the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of robust and distinct functional connectivity patterns, prominently within the frontoparietal control network and the default mode network. We identified the disease subtypes by analysing, via unsupervised and supervised machine learning, the power-envelope-based connectivity of signals reconstructed from high-density resting-state electroencephalography in four datasets of patients with PTSD and MDD, and show that the subtypes are transferable across independent datasets recorded under different conditions. The subtype whose functional connectivity differed most from those of healthy controls was less responsive to psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and failed to respond to an antidepressant medication for MDD. By contrast, both subtypes responded equally well to two different forms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for MDD. Our data-driven approach may constitute a generalizable solution for connectome-based diagnosis.

This Review surveys the basic principles, recent advances and promising future directions for wave-based-metamaterial analogue computing systems.
Despite their widespread use for performing advanced computational tasks, digital signal processors suffer from several restrictions, including low speed, high power consumption and complexity, caused by costly analogue-to-digital converters. For this reason, there has recently been a surge of interest in performing wave-based analogue computations that avoid analogue-to-digital conversion and allow massively parallel operation. In particular, novel schemes for wave-based analogue computing have been proposed based on artificially engineered photonic structures, that is, metamaterials. Such kinds of computing systems, referred to as computational metamaterials, can be as fast as the speed of light and as small as its wavelength, yet, impart complex mathematical operations on an incoming wave packet or even provide solutions to integro-differential equations. These much-sought features promise to enable a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and efficient processing and computing hardware based on light-wave propagation. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the field of computational metamaterials, surveying the state-of-the-art metastructures proposed to perform analogue computation. We further describe some of the most exciting applications suggested for these computing systems, including image processing, edge detection, equation solving and machine learning.

In this study, we develop a robust method for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI simulation images and quantify the pretreatment alignment accuracy using automatically detected fiducial markers in MRI. Methods and Materials In this study, a deep learning-based algorithm was used to convert MRI images into labeled fiducial marker volumes. Seventy-seven prostate cancer patients who received marker implantation prior to MRI and CT simulation imaging were selected for this study. Multiple-Echo T-1-VIBE MRI images were acquired, and images were stratified (at the patient level) based on the presence of intraprostatic calcifications. Ground truth (GT) contours were defined by an expert on MRI using CT images. Training was done using the pix2pix generative adversarial network (GAN) image-to-image translation package and model testing was done using fivefold cross validation. For performance comparison, an experienced medical dosimetrist and a medical physicist each manually contoured fiducial markers in MRI images. The percent of correct detections and F(1)classification scores are reported for markers detected using the automatic detection algorithm and human observers. The patient positioning errors were quantified by calculating the target registration errors (TREs) from fiducial marker driven rigid registration between MRI and CBCT images. Target registration errors were quantified for fiducial marker contours defined on MRI by the automatic detection algorithm and the two expert human observers.

Currently, hyperelastic models based on the energy density function, such as the Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Ogden models, are used to investigate the hyperelastic responses of materials. Conventionally, constants relating to materials were determined from experimental data by using global least-squares fitting. However, formulating a constitutive equation to capture the complex behavior of hyperelastic materials was difficult owing to the limitations of the analytical model and experimental data. This study addresses these limitations by using a system of neural networks (NNs) to design a data-driven surrogate model without a specific function formula, and employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate the massive amount of combined loading data of hyperelastic materials. Thus, MD simulations were used to propose an NN constitutive model for hyperelasticity to derive the constitutive equation to model the complex hyperelastic response. In addition, the probability distributions of the numerical solutions of hyperelasticity are used to characterize the uncertainty of the MD models. These statistical finite element results not only present numerical results with reliability ranges but also scattered distributions of the solution obtained from the MD-based probability distributions.","constitutive equations,finite element methods,hyperelasticity,machine learning,molecular dynamics simulations,neural network",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Mathematics",,3.593,"MATERIAL,BEHAVIOR,POLYMER,MELTS,POLYSTYRENE,ELASTICITY,EQUATION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,,

Thus, tool health monitoring systems are highly desired to improve tool life and increase productivity. This research work focuses on tool wear estimation during turning of Inconel 718 using wavelet packet transform (WPT) signal analysis and machine learning paradigms. A multiple sensor monitoring system, based on the detection of cutting force, acoustic emission and vibration acceleration signals, was employed during experimental turning trials. The detected sensor signals were subjected to WPT decomposition to extract diverse signal features.

The correct positioning of the implants is strongly related to multiple surgical variables that have a tremendous impact on the success of the surgery. Computer-based navigation systems have been investigated and developed in order to assist the surgeon in accurately controlling those surgical variables. The existing technologies are very costly, require additional bone incisions for fixing markers to be tracked, and these markers are usually bulky, interfering with the standard surgical flow. This work presents a markerless navigation system that supports the surgeon in accurately performing the TKA procedure. The proposed system uses a mobile RGB-D camera for replacing the existing optical tracking systems and does not require markers to be tracked. We combine an effective deep learning-based approach for accurately segmenting the bone surface with a robust geometry-based algorithm for registering the bones with pre-operative models. The favourable performance of our pipeline is achieved by (1) employing a semi-supervised labelling approach for generating training data from real TKA surgery data, (2) using effective data augmentation techniques for improving the generalisation capability and (3) using appropriate depth data cleaning strategies. The construction of this complete markerless registration prototype that generalises for unseen intra-operative data is non-obvious, and relevant insights and future research directions can be derived.

Although several approaches based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have been applied to ultrasound image segmentation, they have weak generalization ability. We propose an end-to-end, multiple-channel and atrous CNN designed to extract a greater amount of semantic information for segmentation of ultrasound images. Method A multiple-channel and atrous convolution network is developed, referred to as MA-Net. Similar to U-Net, MA-Net is based on an encoder-decoder architecture and includes five modules: the encoder, atrous convolution, pyramid pooling, decoder, and residual skip pathway modules. In the encoder module, we aim to capture more information with multiple-channel convolution and use large kernel convolution instead of small filters in each convolution operation. In the last layer, atrous convolution and pyramid pooling are used to extract multi-scale features. The architecture of the decoder is similar to that of the encoder module, except that up-sampling is used instead of down-sampling. Furthermore, the residual skip pathway module connects the subnetworks of the encoder and decoder to optimize learning from the deeper layer and improve the accuracy of segmentation. During the learning process, we adopt multi-task learning to enhance segmentation performance. Five types of datasets are used in our experiments. Because the original training data are limited, we apply data augmentation (e.g., horizontal and vertical flipping, random rotations, and random scaling) to our training data. We use the Dice score, precision, recall, Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), and root mean square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) as the metrics for segmentation evaluation. Meanwhile, Friedman test was performed as the nonparametric statistical analysis to evaluate the algorithms. Results For the datasets of brachia plexus (BP), fetal head, and lymph node segmentations, MA-Net achieved average Dice scores of 0.776, 0.973, and 0.858, respectively; with average precisions of 0.787, 0.968, and 0.854, respectively; average recalls of 0.788, 0.978, and 0.885, respectively; average HDs (mm) of 13.591, 10.924, and 19.245, respectively; average ASDs (mm) of 4.822, 4.152, and 4.312, respectively; and average RMSDs (mm) of 4.979, 4.161, and 4.930, respectively. Compared with U-Net, U-Net++, M-Net, and Dilated U-Net, the average performance of the MA-Net increased by approximately 5.68%, 2.85%, 6.59%, 36.03%, 23.64%, and 31.71% for Dice, precision, recall, HD, ASD, and RMSD, respectively. Moreover, we verified the generalization of MA-Net segmentation to lower grade brain glioma MRI and lung CT images. In addition, the MA-Net achieved the highest mean rank in the Friedman test. Conclusion The proposed MA-Net accurately segments ultrasound images with high generalization, and therefore, it offers a useful tool for diagnostic application in ultrasound images.","atrous convolution,multiple-channel convolution,pyramid pooling,ultrasound image",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,DEEP",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Materials and methods One hundred sixty-two patients with carotid stenosis were randomly divided into training and test cohorts. Multi-contrast MRI including time of flight (TOF), T1- and T2-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced imaging was done. Radiological characteristics of the carotid plaques were recorded and calculated to build a traditional model. After extracting the radiomics features on these images, we constructed HRPMM with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm in the training cohort and evaluated its performance in the test cohort. A combined model was also built using both the traditional and radiomics features. The performance of all the models in the identification of high-risk carotid plaque was compared. Results Intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid-rich necrotic core were independently associated with clinical symptoms and were used to build the traditional model, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.825 versus 0.804 in the training and test cohorts. The HRPMM and the combined model achieved an AUC of 0.988 versus 0.984 and of 0.989 versus 0.986 respectively in the two cohorts. Both the radiomics model and combined model outperformed the traditional model, whereas the combined model showed no significant difference with the HRPMM. Conclusions Our MRI-based radiomics model can accurately distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic carotid plaques.

Machine Learning (ML), more specifically Deep Neural network algorithms rely on expansive image databases and various training methods (supervised, unsupervised) to ""make sense"" out of the content of an image. Take for example how students of architecture learn to differentiate various architectural styles. Whether this be to differentiate between Gothic, Baroque or Modern Architecture, students are exposed to hundreds, or even thousands of images of the respective styles, while being trained by faculty to be able to differentiate between those styles. A reversal of the process, striving to produce imagery, instead of reading it and understanding its content, allows machine vision techniques to be utilized as a design methodology that profoundly interrogates aspects of agency and authorship in the presence of Artificial Intelligence in architecture design. This notion forms part of a larger conversation on the nature of human ingenuity operating within a posthuman design ecology. The inherent ability of Neural Networks to process large databases opens up the opportunity to sift through the enormous repositories of imagery generated by the architecture discipline through the ages in order to find novel and bespoke solutions to architectural problems. This article strives to demystify the romantic idea of individual artistic design choices in architecture by providing a glimpse under the hood of the inner workings of Neural Network processes, and thus the extent of their ability to inform architectural design. The approach takes cues from the language and methods employed by experts in Deep Learning such as Hallucinations, Dreaming, Style Transfer and Vision. The presented approach is the base for an in-depth exploration of its meaning as a cultural technique within the discipline. Culture in the extent of this article pertains to ideas such as the differentiation between symbolic and material cultures, in which symbols are defined as the common denominator of a specific group of people.(1)The understanding and exchange of symbolic values is inherently connected to language and code, which ultimately form the ingrained texture of any form of coded environment, including the coded structure of Neural Networks.

It has developed from single frequency to multiple frequencies, and eventually to pulsed and swept-frequency excitation. Recent progression of wireless power transfer (WPT) and flexible printed devices open opportunities to address challenges of defect detection and reconstruction under complex geometric situations. In this paper, a transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) flexible printed coil (FPC) array that uses the WPT approach featuring dual resonance responses for the first time has been proposed. The dual resonance responses can provide multiple parameters of samples, such as defect characteristics, lift-offs and material properties, while the flexible coil array allows area mapping of complex structures. To validate the proposed approach, experimental investigations of a single excitation coil with multiple receiving coils using the WPT principle were conducted on a curved pipe surface with a natural dent defect. The FPC array has one single excitation coil and 16 receiving (Rx) coils, which are used to measure the dent by using 21 C-scan points on the dedicated dent sample. The experimental data were then used for training and evaluation of dual resonance responses in terms of multiple feature extraction, selection and fusion for quantitative NDE. Four features, which include resonant magnitudes and principal components of the two resonant areas, were investigated for mapping and reconstructing the defective dent through correlation analysis for feature selection and feature fusion by deep learning. It shows that deep learning-based multiple feature fusion has outstanding performance for 3D defect reconstruction of WPT-based FPC-ECT.

To assess the performance of deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning based radiomics on 3D computed tomography (CT) and clinical characteristics to predict benign or malignant sacral tumors.
Materials and methods
This single-center retrospective analysis included 459 patients with pathologically proven sacral tumors. After semi-automatic segmentation, 1,316 hand-crafted radiomics features of each patient were extracted. All models were built on training set (321 patients) and tested on validation set (138 patients). A DNN model and four machine learning classifiers (logistic regression [LR], random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM] and k-nearest neighbor [KNN]) based on CT features and clinical characteristics were built, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) were used to evaluate different models.
Results
In total, 459 patients (255 males, 204 females; mean age of 42.1 +/- 17.8 years, range 4-82 years) were enrolled in this study, including 206 cases of benign tumor and 253 cases of malignant tumor. The sex, age and tumor size had significant differences between the benign tumors and malignant tumors (chi(2) (sex) = 10.854, Z(age) = -6.616, Z(size) = 2.843, P < 0.05). The radscore, sex, and age were important indicators for differentiating benign and malignant sacral tumors (odds ratio [OR]1 = 2.492, OR2 = 2.236, OR3 = 1.037, P < 0.01). Among the four clinical-radiomics models (RMs), clinical-LR had the best performance in the validation set (AUC = 0.84, ACC = 0.81). The clinical-DNN model also achieved a high performance (an AUC of 0.83 and an ACC of 0.76 in the validation set) in identifying benign and malignant sacral tumors.

Hence, understanding the effects of interaction errors and especially the effect of prior knowledge on robot learning performance is relevant to develop appropriate approaches for learning under natural interaction conditions, since future robots will continue to learn based on what they have already learned. In this study, we investigated interaction errors that occurred under two learning conditions, i.e., in the case that the robot learned without prior knowledge (cold-start learning) and in the case that the robot had prior knowledge (warm-start learning). In our human-robot interaction scenario, the robot learns to assign the correct action to a current human intention (gesture). Gestures were not predefined but the robot had to learn their meaning. We used a contextual-bandit approach to maximize the expected payoff by updating (a) the current human intention (gesture) and (b) the current human intrinsic feedback after each action selection of the robot. As an intrinsic evaluation of the robot behavior we used the error-related potential (ErrP) in the human electroencephalogram as reinforcement signal. Either gesture errors (human intentions) can be misinterpreted by incorrectly captured gestures or errors in the ErrP classification (human feedback) can occur. We investigated these two types of interaction errors and their effects on the learning process. Our results show that learning and its online adaptation was successful under both learning conditions (except for one subject in cold-start learning). Furthermore, warm-start learning achieved faster convergence, while cold-start learning was less affected by online changes in the current context.","human-robot interaction (HRI),error-related potentials (ErrPs),reinforcement learning,robotics,long-term learning,learning with prior knowledge",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Robotics,,,,FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.558531/pdf,

Traditional modeling approaches the problem through a physical and chemical understanding of the complicated fouling phenomena. In this study, a large amount of data has been collected from a pilot-scale ultrafiltration membrane system treating spent filter backwash water at a water treatment plant. Environmental variables and operational parameters including temperature, hydraulic pressure, water turbidity, etc. are monitored continuously. This work focuses on revealing the hidden nonlinear relationships of these variables via data driven methodologies without building a first principles process model. Machine learning tools are used to establish a connection between environmental variables, dynamic parameters, the efficiency of foulant removal through backwashing, and the increase rate of foulants. The prediction performance is compared to regression models including linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Our data driven model of the fouling dynamics is then used for optimization purposes, in particular, to optimize the backwashing sequence timing by applying tools from stochastic dynamic programming. Optimized backwash performance is compared with experimental data acquired via a fixed interval sequence and shows a more efficient schedule at less cost and with lower membrane resistance. This work establishes a full pipeline of data processing, model building, and operational optimization. The only requirement for employing our methodology is the collection of operational data, in order to identify the membrane dynamics. The reported methodology offers a great potential for implementation on large-scale ultrafiltration applications, which can improve energy consumption and elongate membrane life.","Ultrafiltration membrane,Pilot-scale experiment,Data-driven modeling,System optimization,Membrane backwash",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Polymer Science",,8.411,"EXTRACELLULAR,POLYMERIC,SUBSTANCES,WATER-TREATMENT,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,HOLLOW-FIBER,MICROFILTRATION,COMMUNITY",JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE,,

As the dominant form of storage, adsorbed gas in shale formation is of primary importance to be assessed. This paper summarizes adsorption models into traditional pressure/density dependent isothermal models, pressure and temperature unified model, and machine learning based models. Using a comprehensive experimental dataset, these models are applied to simulate shale gas adsorption under in-situ conditions. Results show that the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) model provides the optimal performance in traditional isothermal models. Pressure and temperature unified models make a breakthrough in isothermal conditions and can extrapolate the predictions beyond test ranges of temperature. Well-trained machine learning models not only break the limit of the isothermal condition and types of shale formation, but can also provide reasonable extrapolations beyond test ranges of temperature, total organic carbon (TOC), and moisture. Four popular machine learning algorithms are used, which include artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The XGBoost model is found to provide the best results for predicting shale gas adsorption, and it can be conveniently updated for broader applications with more available data. Overall, this paper demonstrates the capability of machine learning for prediction of shale gas adsorption, and the well-trained model can potentially be built into a large numerical frame to optimize production curves of shale gas.","Shale gas,Adsorption model,Classical model,Machine learning,XGBoost",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,6.63,"SUPERCRITICAL,METHANE,HIGH-PRESSURE,RESERVOIRS,EQUATION,COAL",FUEL,,

An input image is first spilt into a set of non-overlapping fixed-sized image patches, and a deep convolutional neural network model is constructed to extract initial lung regions by classifying image patches. Superpixel segmentation is then performed on the preprocessed thoracic CT image, and the lung contours are locally refined according to corresponding superpixel contours with our adjacent point statistics method. Segmented lung contours are further globally refined by an edge direction tracing technique for the inclusion of juxta-pleural lesions. Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT scans with interstitial lung diseases.

To address this challenge, a deep learning-based technique was developed to minimize such residual motion effects. Methods The data-rejection approach was adopted in which motion-corrupted data are discarded before model-fitting. A deep learning-based parameter estimation algorithm, using a hierarchical convolutional neural network (H-CNN), was combined with motion assessment and corrupted volume rejection. The method was designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods of this kind that produce parameter estimations whose quality depends strongly on a proportion of the data discarded. Evaluation experiments were conducted for the estimation of diffusion kurtosis and diffusion-tensor-derived measures at both the individual and group levels. The performance was compared with the robust approach of iteratively reweighted linear least squares (IRLLS) after motion correction with and without outlier replacement. Results Compared with IRLLS, the H-CNN-based technique is minimally sensitive to motion effects. It was tested at severe motion levels when 70% to 90% of the data are rejected and when random motion is present. The technique had a stable performance independent of the numbers and schemes of data rejection. A further test on a data set from children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder shows the technique can potentially ameliorate spurious group-level difference caused by head motion. Conclusion This method shows great potential for reducing residual motion effects in motion-corrupted diffusion-weighted-imaging data, bringing benefits that include reduced bias in derived metrics in individual scans and reduced motion-level-dependent bias in population studies employing diffusion MRI.","diffusion kurtosis imaging,diffusion tensor imaging,head motion,neural network",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"LINEAR,LEAST-SQUARES,ROBUST,ESTIMATION,DISTORTION,CORRECTION,HEAD,MOTION,TENSOR,MRI,MOVEMENT,ARTIFACTS,FRAMEWORK,ACCURATE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10115261/3/Gong_Main-MRM-20-21048-clean.pdf,

Studies on parent material allow interpreting soil genesis processes and improve our knowledge of specific soil attributes. However, soil parent material maps at detailed cartographic scale (finer than 1:100,000) are rare in tropical areas and it is usually inferred from poorly detailed geological data, which generally group different lithologies into single units. Thus, we propose a methodology to map soil parent material based on remote sensing and machine learning in a geologically very complex area. The study site covers 1378 km(2) in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Prediction models used data from 280 geological observation points, a digital elevation model (spatial resolution of 5 m, upscale to 30 m) and multitemporal Landsat images in a range of 30 years. We evaluated six classification algorithms, namely random forest, decision tree, support vector machine, multinomial logistic regression, K-means (unsupervised classification), and object-based image analysis with maximum likelihood classification. Environmental covariates were grouped to create different scenarios combining terrain derivatives, hydrologic covariates, topsoil spectral reflectance, and spatial coordinates. A bare soil image, elaborated using 30 years of Landsat data, was evaluated as a covariate to predict soil parent material. Predictions were validated using three different strategies: crossvalidation, separate validation dataset (20%), and comparison with legacy geological maps (information from two areas with geological maps at fine scale). We also assessed the correspondence between the map of predicted soil parent material and data of soil particle size from 571 soil sampling points. Random forest algorithm presented the best validation performance, whereas the group of terrain derivatives and hydrologic covariates explained most of model variation.

Methods The model was based on a connected residual deconvolution network (CResDevNet) and compared with UNet as a baseline. The DVHs of OARs are dependent on patient anatomical features of the planning target volumes and OARs, and these spatial relationships can be learned automatically from prior high-quality plans. The contours of planning target volumes and OARs were parsed from the plan database and used as the input to the model, and the dose-area histograms (DAHs) of the OARs were output from the model. The model was trained from scratch by correlating anatomical features with DAHs of OARs, then accumulating these histograms to obtain the final predicted DVH for each OAR. Helical tomotherapy plans for 170 nasopharyngeal cancer patients were used to train and validate the model. An additional 60 patient treatment plans were used to test the predictive accuracy of the model. The DVHs and dose-volume indices (DVIs) of clinical interest for each OAR in the testing dataset were predicted to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The mean absolute errors in the DVIs for each OAR were calculated using each model and statistically compared using a paired-samplest-test. Dice similarity coefficients for areas of the DVHs were also evaluated. Results Dose-volume histograms of 21 OARs in nasopharyngeal cancer were predicted using the models. For each patient, 63 DVIs for all OARs were calculated. Using the 60 patient treatment plans in the testing dataset, 79% and 73% of the DVIs predicted using the CResDevNet and UNet models, respectively, were within 5% of the clinical values. The median value of the DVIs' mean absolute errors was 3.2 +/- 2.5% and 3.7 +/- 2.9% for the CResDevNet and UNet models, respectively. The average dice similarity coefficient for all OARs was 0.965 using the CResDevNet model and 0.958 using the UNet model. Conclusions A deep learning model was developed for predicting achievable DVHs of OARs. The prediction accuracy of the CResDevNet model was evaluated using a planning database of nasopharyngeal cancer cases and shown to be more accurate than the UNet model. Prediction accuracy was also higher for larger-volume OARs. The model can be used for automation of inverse planning and quality assessment of individual treatment plans.","dose-volume histogram,deep learning,dose-area histogram,inverse planning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"AT-RISK,THERAPY,CANCER,HEAD",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Since manual delineation is time-consuming and laborious, we develop a deep learning-based framework for automatic pancreas segmentation in three dimensional (3D) medical images. Methods A two-stage framework is designed for automatic pancreas delineation. In the localization stage, a Square Root Dice loss is developed to handle the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In refinement stage, a novel 2.5D slice interaction network with slice correlation module is proposed to capture the non-local cross-slice information at multiple feature levels. Also a self-supervised learning-based pre-training method, slice shuffle, is designed to encourage the inter-slice communication. To further improve the accuracy and robustness, ensemble learning and a recurrent refinement process are adopted in the segmentation flow. Results The segmentation technique is validated in a public dataset (NIH Pancreas-CT) with 82 abdominal contrast-enhanced 3D CT scans.

However, due to severe sparse view sampling artifacts, current 4D CBCT data lack sufficient image quality for accurate motion quantification. In the present paper, we introduce a deep learning-based framework for boosting the image quality of 4D CBCT image data that can be combined with any CBCT reconstruction approach and clinical 4D CBCT workflow. Methods Boosting is achieved by learning the relationship between so-called sparse view pseudo-time-average CBCT images obtained by a projection selection scheme introduced to mimic phase image sparse view artifact characteristics and corresponding time-average CBCT images obtained by full view reconstruction. The employed convolutional neural network architecture is the residual dense network (RDN). The underlying hypothesis is that the RDN learns the appearance of the streaking artifacts that is typical for 4D CBCT phase images - and removes them without influencing the anatomical image information. After training the RDN, it can be applied to the 4D CBCT phase images to enhance the image quality without affecting the contained temporal and motion information. Different to existing approaches, no patient-specific prior knowledge about anatomy or motion characteristics is needed, that is, the proposed approach is self-contained. Results Application of the trained network to reconstructed phase images of an external (SPARE challenge) as well as in-house 4D CBCT patient and motion phantom data set reduces the phase image streak artifacts consistently for all patients and state-of-the-art reconstruction approaches. Using the SPARE data set, we show that the root mean squared error compared to ground truth data provided by the challenge is reduced by approximately 50% while normalized cross correlation of reconstruction and ground truth is improved up to 10%. Compared to direct deep learning-based 4D CBCT to 4D CT mapping, our proposed method performs better because inappropriate prior knowledge about the patient anatomy and physiology is taken into account. Moreover, the image quality enhancement leads to more plausible motion fields estimated by deformable image registration (DIR) in the 4D CBCT image sequences. Conclusions The presented framework enables significantly boosting of 4D CBCT image quality as well as improved DIR and motion field consistency. Thus, the proposed method facilitates extraction of motion information from severely artifact-affected images, which is one of the key challenges of integrating 4D CBCT imaging into RT workflows.","4D cone-beam computed tomography,artifact reduction,deep learning,image reconstruction,image registration,image quality",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"RADIATION-THERAPY,RESPIRATORY,MOTION,LIVER,RADIOTHERAPY,QUALITY,MODEL",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.14441,

The second best was the NB classifier, and the relatively worst was the KNN classifier. The linear continuous EEG features were selected by interpolation and can be found for all human subjects.

However, identifying suitable printing conditions for new materials requires extensive experimentation in a time and resource-demanding process. This study investigates the use of Machine Learning (ML) for distinguishing between printing configurations that are likely to result in low-quality prints and printing configurations that are more promising as a first step toward the development of a recommendation system for identifying suitable printing conditions. The ML-based framework takes as input the printing conditions regarding the material composition and the printing parameters and predicts the quality of the resulting print as either ""low"" or ""high."" We investigate two ML-based approaches: a direct classification-based approach that trains a classifier to distinguish between low- and high-quality prints and an indirect approach that uses a regression ML model that approximates the values of a printing quality metric. Both modes are built upon Random Forests. We trained and evaluated the models on a dataset that was generated in a previous study, which investigated fabrication of porous polymer scaffolds by means of extrusion-based 3D printing with a full-factorial design. Our results show that both models were able to correctly label the majority of the tested configurations while a simpler linear ML model was not effective. Additionally, our analysis showed that a full factorial design for data collection can lead to redundancies in the data, in the context of ML, and we propose a more efficient data collection strategy.

While most empirical potentials are benchmarked against a set of carefully chosen bulk material properties, recent advances in machine learning have seen the emergence of neural-network-based mathematical potentials capable of describing highly complex potential energy surfaces for a variety of systems. We report here the development of a neural-network interatomic potential (NNIP) with modified embedded-atom method background density as fingerprint functions, which could accurately model the energetics of metallic nanoparticles and clusters (Cu as a representative example) widely used in catalysis. To appropriately account for the diverse chemical environments encountered in nanoparticles/nanoclusters, an extensive set of atomic configurations (totaling 18 084) were calculated using density-functional-theory (DFT) at the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof level. In addition to standard bulk properties such as cohesive energies and elastic constants, the sampled configurations also include a substantial number of differently oriented crystal facets and differently sized nanoparticles and nanoclusters, greatly expanding the value range of NNIP features that was otherwise quite limited. The complex energy potential surface of Cu can be faithfully reproduced, with an average error of 0.011 eV/at for energy states within 3 eV of the ground state. As an illustration, the developed NNIP is used to simulate the molecular dynamics of copper nanoparticles, and good agreement is achieved between DFT and the NNIP.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,DEFECT FORMATION,FORCE-FIELD,FCC METALS,SIMULATIONS,DISCOVERY,INVERSION,ENERGY",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,DEFECT,FORMATION,FORCE-FIELD,FCC,METALS,SIMULATIONS,DISCOVERY,INVERSION,ENERGY",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted numerous medical specialties with high emphasis on radiology. Associated novel diagnostic methods have become a rapidly emerging hot topic, and it is essential to provide insights into quantitative analysis of the growing literature.
Purpose
The purpose of this study is to highlight future academic trends, identify potential research gaps, and analyze scientific landscape of AI in the field of medicine. The main aim is to explore comprehensive dataset over a 46-year period in terms of publication type, publication citation, country of origin, institution, and medical specialty.
Material and Methods
The Web of Science database was searched from 1975 to 2020, and publications on AI were explored. Both original research reports and review articles were included in comprehensive bibliometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and numerous variables were applied, namely year of publication, institution, type of publication, specialty area, country of origin, and citation numbers, and the KruskalWallis analysis of variance was used.
Results
A total of 117,974 relevant citations were retrieved, of which 83,979 original research and review articles were retained for analysis. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of citations were from the United States (23%, n = 19,180) followed by China, Spain, England, and Germany. The number of citations was relatively consistent during the 1970s and emerging gradually during the 1980s. However, ongoing scientific trend positively evolved, and the numbers started to grow significantly in the 1990s and demonstrated continuous increasing wave since then. The most frequently represented key medical specialties were oncology, radiology, neuroradiology, and ophthalmology. Overall, no major statistical difference was found between these four domains (p = 0.753).
Conclusions
In summary, research on AI-powered technologies in the medical domain was at early stage in the 1970s. However, associated deep learning algorithms significantly attracted and revolutionized the scientific community with subsequent evolution of research and exponential growth of multidisciplinary publications since that time. Work in this field has impacted radiology as an area of predominant interest and has been led by institutions in the United States, Spain, France, China, and England. The bibliometric study reported herein can provide a broad overview and valuable guidance to help medical researchers gain insights into key points and trace the global trends regarding the status of AI research in medicine, particularly in radiology and other relevant multispecialty areas.","machine learning,artificial intelligence,medicine,radiology,bibliometric analysis",Article,"CUREUS INC, PO BOX 61002, PALO ALTO, CA 94306 USA",General & Internal Medicine,,,,CUREUS,https://www.cureus.com/articles/42017-artificial-intelligence-in-various-medical-fields-with-emphasis-on-radiology-statistical-evaluation-of-the-literature.pdf,

Thus, EXAFS has been widely used for the investigation of catalytic reactions, battery degradation, and other material developments. However, the data conversion from EXAFS to RDF involves three difficulties: weak signals, necessity of a wide energy range (similar to 1000 eV), and fitting parameters in reference samples. Recently, the direct estimation technique of RDF from EXAFS using machine learning was successfully developed, which overcomes the third problem. Here, we used an artificial neural network (ANN) to directly predict RDF from the near-edge region of the spectrum (X-ray absorption near-edge structure: XANES), which enables overcoming all of the difficulties. The ANN can correctly generate RDF only from XANES. XANES includes information about the bond length and coordination numbers in the range of similar to 5 angstrom. We applied our prediction model to an experimental spectrum and confirmed its accuracy. The method proposed here is greatly beneficial for measuring the local bond length and coordination of materials whose extended energy region is difficult to be measured.","FINE-STRUCTURE,ALLOYS",Article,"PHYSICAL SOC JAPAN, YUSHIMA URBAN BUILDING 5F, 2-31-22 YUSHIMA, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0034, JAPAN",Physics,,1.54,"FINE-STRUCTURE,ALLOYS",JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN,https://doi.org/10.7566/jpsj.89.103001,

LDA is used to extract features from images, and SVM classifier is used to classify the sub-datasets with strong fusion features. On this basis, fusion index and intermediary centrality index are selected to measure the fusion degree of patent sub-centralization technology and identify the key technologies in the fusion process, Because of the fusion of several algorithms, the algorithm needs many iteration training, and the computation time is too long.

However, directly decoding the QRS complex of ECG from PPG is challenging because PPG signals usually have different offsets due to 1) different devices, and 2) personal differences, which makes the alignment difficult. In this paper, we make the first attempt to reconstruct the QRS complex of ECG only from the recording of PPG by an end-to-end deep learning-based approach. Specifically, we propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture containing three components: 1) a sequence transformer network which automatically calibrates the offset, 2) an attention network, which dynamically identifies regions of interest, and 3) a new QRS complex-enhanced loss for better reconstruction. The experiment results on a real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: 3.67% R peak failure rate of the reconstructed ECG and high correlation of pulse transit time between the reconstructed QRS complex and the groundtruth QRS complex (rho = 0.844), which creates a new opportunity for low-cost clinical studies via the waveform-level reconstruction of the QRS complex of ECG from PPG.","Electrocardiography,Monitoring,Electrodes,Biomedical monitoring,Skin,Standards,Sensors,Convolutional neural network,electrocardiography,encoder-decoder,photoplethysmography,transform network",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"PULSE,TRANSIT-TIME,RESPIRATORY,RATE,ECG,ELECTROCARDIOGRAM",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,,

A complete understanding of the mechanism for intermetallics compound (IMC) growth under thermomigration is essential for devising solder materials resistant to degradation under thermal gradient. This work integrates neural network analysis with multi-phase field method to quantify the mechanism of thermomigration at the cold side of a solder-substrate system. At hot side temperature of 523.15 K, 1D multi-phase field model is built for a combined driving force of bulk diffusion and thermomigration, and is solved using finite element method (FEM). The free energy density function for the thermomigration driving force is introduced, and coupled with the functions for bulk and interfacial free energy density of each phase. Data of heats of transport, temperature difference and growth rate constant of IMC are obtained from multiple FEM simulations, and the FEM-generated dataset is employed in the neural network. The machine learning predicted growth rate constant is tallied with experimental value, and heat of transport of Cu in IMC phase (Q(Cu)(imc)) is determined from the inverse method. The obtained value of optimized Q(Cu)(imc) is +35.10 kJ/mol. 2D IMC grain growth simulations are performed with hot-side at 523.15 K and the cold side lowered to 523.0817 K and 522.0 K respectively, thereby revealing that the accelerated grain growth for larger temperature difference is noticed within the first 20 s of the simulations.","Multi-phase field method,Thermomigration,Intermetallic compound,Neural network,Heat of transport,Finite element method",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mechanics",,5.199,"INTERMETALLIC,COMPOUNDS,SOLDER,JOINTS,DRIVING-FORCE,MODEL,SN%2FCU,ELECTROMIGRATION,FRAMEWORK,ENERGY",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/655889/2/Kunwar_et_al_thermomigration_2020_V1_postprint.pdf,

Primarily, semiconducting metal-oxide based gas sensors sense various gases simultaneously, hence their selectivity is poor. This paper presents a single chemiresistive metal-oxide gas sensor for identification of multiple VOCs accurately by employing highly sensitive microstructure and machine learning tools. Tin oxide (SnO2) hollowspheres were taken as sensing material that were prepared through optimized hydrothermal route. Different characterizations were carried out to confirm the formation of desired morphology and structural features. The sensor device was fabricated by controlled drop cast technique over gold based interdigitated electrodes. The sensor showed remarkable response towards the target VOCs with high sensitivity and fast recovery time. Incorporation of machine learning algorithm on the obtained sensor data provided accurate identification of all the VOCs (best performance shown by random forest). In addition, the quantitative prediction of gas concentration was performed for each target gas using regression model.
