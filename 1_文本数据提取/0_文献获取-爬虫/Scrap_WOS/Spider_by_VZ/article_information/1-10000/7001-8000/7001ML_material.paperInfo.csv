In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to automatically segment this ""invisible target"". As the main idea of our design, we expect to get reference from the surrounding normal structures (bladder&rectum) and take advantage of this information to facilitate the prostate bed segmentation. To achieve this goal, we first use a U-Net as the backbone network to perform the bladder&rectum segmentation, which serves as a low-level task that can provide references to the high-level task of the prostate bed segmentation. Based on the backbone network, we build a novel attention network with a series of cascaded attention modules to further extract discriminative features for the high-level prostate bed segmentation task. Since the attention network has one-sided dependency on the backbone network, simulating the clinical workflow to use normal structures to guide the segmentation of radiotherapy target, we name the final composition model asymmetrical multi-task attention U-Net. Extensive experiments on a clinical dataset consisting of 186 CT images demonstrate the effectiveness of this new design and the superior performance of the model in comparison to the conventional atlas-based methods for prostate bed segmentation.

This research can potentially be applied in improving the accuracy of clinical skin cancer diagnostics.
In this study, we compare six different machine learning methods in the inversion of a stochastic model for light propagation in layered media, and use the inverse models to estimate four parameters of the skin from the simulated data: melanin concentration, hemoglobin volume fraction, and thicknesses of epidermis and dermis. The aim of this study is to determine the best methods for stochastic model inversion in order to improve current methods in skin related cancer diagnostics and in the future develop a non-invasive way to measure the physical parameters of the skin based partially on the results of the study. Of the compared methods, which are convolutional neural network, multi-layer perceptron, lasso, stochastic gradient descent, and linear support vector machine regressors, we find the convolutional neural network to be the most accurate in the inversion task.","skin,physical parameter retrieval,neural networks,convolutional neural network,machine learning,model inversion",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,TUTORIAL",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/20/7097/pdf,
3,Improving Computer-Aided Cervical Cells Classification Using Transfer Learning Based Snapshot Ensemble,10,20,,"Chen Wen,Li Xinyu,Gao Liang,Shen Weiming","Chen W,Li XY,Gao L,Shen WM",Shen WM,10.3390/app10207292,Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Cervical cells classification is a crucial component of computer-aided cervical cancer detection. Fine-grained classification is of great clinical importance when guiding clinical decisions on the diagnoses and treatment, which remains very challenging. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a novel way to classify cervical cells by using automatically learned features. Although the ensemble of CNN models can increase model diversity and potentially boost the classification accuracy, it is a multi-step process, as several CNN models need to be trained respectively and then be selected for ensemble. On the other hand, due to the small training samples, the advantages of powerful CNN models may not be effectively leveraged. In order to address such a challenging issue, this paper proposes a transfer learning based snapshot ensemble (TLSE) method by integrating snapshot ensemble learning with transfer learning in a unified and coordinated way. Snapshot ensemble provides ensemble benefits within a single model training procedure, while transfer learning focuses on the small sample problem in cervical cells classification. Furthermore, a new training strategy is proposed for guaranteeing the combination. The TLSE method is evaluated on a pap-smear dataset called Herlev dataset and is proved to have some superiorities over the exiting methods. It demonstrates that TLSE can improve the accuracy in an ensemble manner with only one single training process for the small sample in fine-grained cervical cells classification.","cervical cells classification,snapshot ensemble,transfer learning,deep convolutional neural network,deep learning,medical image",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,CANCER,SEGMENTATION,ALGORITHM",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/20/7292/pdf,

The algorithms are based on recent advances in multi-dimensional signal processing and aim to advance current state-of-the-art computer-aided detection and analysis of breast tumours when these are observed at various states of development. The topics discussed include image feature extraction, information fusion using radiomics, multi-parametric computer-aided classification and diagnosis using information fusion of tensorial datasets as well as Clifford algebra based classification approaches and convolutional neural network deep learning methodologies. The discussion also extends to semi-supervised deep learning and self-supervised strategies as well as generative adversarial networks and algorithms using generated confrontational learning approaches. In order to address the problem of weakly labelled tumour images, generative adversarial deep learning strategies are considered for the classification of different tumour types. The proposed data fusion approaches provide a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework for more robust image registration that can potentially advance the early identification of heterogeneous tumour types, even when the associated imaged organs are registered as separate entities embedded in more complex geometric spaces. Finally, the general structure of a high-dimensional medical imaging analysis platform that is based on multi-task detection and learning is proposed as a way forward. The proposed algorithm makes use of novel loss functions that form the building blocks for a generated confrontation learning methodology that can be used for tensorial DCE-MRI. Since some of the approaches discussed are also based on time-lapse imaging, conclusions on the rate of proliferation of the disease can be made possible. The proposed framework can potentially reduce the costs associated with the interpretation of medical images by providing automated, faster and more consistent diagnosis.","Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging,multi-channel reconstruction,self-supervised and semi-supervised deep learning,breast cancer,computer aided classification,breast density",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,BACKGROUND,PARENCHYMAL,ENHANCEMENT,DCE-MRI,MAMMOGRAPHIC,DENSITY,CONTRAST,AGENTS,IMAGES,RADIOMICS,FEATURES,TUMOR,SEGMENTATION",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/20/7201/pdf,

This is a retrospective study of 110 computed tomography (CT) scans from patients admitted to the Michigan Medicine Neurological Intensive Care Unit or Emergency Department. A machine learning pipeline was developed to segment and assess the severity of subdural hematoma. First, the probability of each point belonging to the hematoma region was determined using a combination of hand-crafted and deep features. This probability provided the initial state of the segmentation. Next, a 3D post-processing model was applied to evolve the initial state and delineate the hematoma. The recall, precision, and Dice similarity coefficient of the proposed segmentation method were 78.61%, 76.12%, and 75.35%, respectively, for the entire population. The Dice similarity coefficient was 79.97% for clinically significant hematomas, which compared favorably to an inter-rater Dice similarity coefficient. In volume-based severity analysis, the proposed model yielded an F1, recall, and specificity of 98.22%, 98.81%, and 92.31%, respectively, in detecting moderate and severe subdural hematomas based on hematoma volume. These results show that the combination of classical image processing and deep learning can outperform deep learning only methods to achieve greater average performance and robustness.

Thus, new sensing approaches are required with improved sensor selectivity. We are developing a new generation of gas sensors, known as multivariable sensors, that have several independent responses for multi-gas detection with a single sensor. In this study, we analyze the capabilities of natural and fabricated photonic three-dimensional (3-D) nanostructures as sensors for the detection of different gaseous species, such as vapors and non-condensable gases. We employed bare Morpho butterfly wing scales to control their gas selectivity with different illumination angles. Next, we chemically functionalized Morpho butterfly wing scales with a fluorinated silane to boost the response of these nanostructures to the vapors of interest and to suppress the response to ambient humidity. Further, we followed our previously developed design rules for sensing nanostructures and fabricated bioinspired inorganic 3-D nanostructures to achieve functionality beyond natural Morpho scales. These fabricated nanostructures have embedded catalytically active gold nanoparticles to operate at high temperatures of approximate to 300 degrees C for the detection of gases for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.

However, the current lack of pertinent design rules has led to a hesitance to accept structural members made with RAC. It would entail even more difficulties when facing application scenarios where brittle failure is possible (e.g., beam in shear). In this paper, existing major shear design formulae established primarily for conventional concrete beams were assessed for RAC beams. Results showed that when applied to the shear test database compiled for RAC beams, those formulae provided only inaccurate estimations with surprisingly large scatter. To cope with this bias, machine learning (ML) techniques deemed as potential alternative predictors were resorted to. First, a Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was carried out to rank the importance of the parameters that would affect the shear capacity of RAC beams. Then, two contemporary ML approaches, namely, the artificial neural network (ANN) and the random forest (RF), were leveraged to simulate the beams' shear strength. It was found that both models produced even better predictions than the evaluated formulae. With this superiority, a parametric study was undertaken to observe the trends of how the parameters played roles in influencing the shear resistance of RAC beams. The findings indicated that, though less influential than the structural parameters such as shear span ratio, the effect of the replacement ratio of recycled aggregate (RA) was still significant. Nevertheless, the value of v(c)/(f(c))(1/2) (i.e., the shear contribution from RAC normalized with respect to the square root of its strength) predicted by the ML-based approaches appeared to be insignificantly affected by the replacement level. Given the existing inevitable large experimental scatter, more shear tests are certainly needed and, for safe application of RAC, using partial factors calibrated to consider the uncertainty is feasible when designing the shear strength of RAC beams. Some suggestions for future works are also given at the end of this paper.","recycled aggregate concrete,beam,shear capacity,Grey relational analysis,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,FLEXURAL,PERFORMANCE,TRANSVERSE,REINFORCEMENT,ELASTIC-MODULUS,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,SIZE,DESIGN,ELEMENTS",MATERIALS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602073,

Techniques in machine learning simplify the feature extraction process, where sometimes it can be reduced to a fixed segmentation. The applied database includes visits taken in two different days and three different conditions (sitting down, standing up after exercise), which is not common in current public databases. These characteristics allow studying differences among users under different scenarios, which may affect the pattern in the acquired data. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is used as a classifier to form a baseline, as it has a simple structure that has provided good results in the state-of-the-art. This work studies its behavior in ECG verification by using QRS complexes, finding its best hyperparameter configuration through tuning. The final performance is calculated considering different visits for enrolling and verification. Differentiation in the QRS complexes is also tested, as it is already required for detection, proving that applying a simple first differentiation gives a good result in comparison to state-of-the-art similar works. Moreover, it also improves the computational cost by avoiding complex transformations and using only one type of signal. When applying different numbers of complexes, the best results are obtained when 100 and 187 complexes in enrolment, obtaining Equal Error Rates (EER) that range between 2.79-4.95% and 2.69-4.71%, respectively.","ECG biometrics,machine learning,pattern recognition",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/10016/33134/1/QRS_APPLSCI_2020.pdf,
17,Prediction of Slag Characteristics Based on Artificial Neural Network for Molten Gasification of Hazardous Wastes,13,19,,"Lin Xiongchao,Xi Wenshuai,Dai Jinze,Wang Caihong,Wang Yonggang","Lin XC,Xi WS,Dai JZ,Wang CH,Wang YG",Lin XC,10.3390/en13195115,China University of Mining & Technology,"Molten gasification is considered as a promising technology for the processing and safe disposal of hazardous wastes. During this process, the organic components are completely converted while the hazardous materials are safely embedded in slag via the fusion-solidification-vitrification transformation. Ideally, the slag should be glassy with low viscosity to ensure the effective immobilization and steady discharge of hazardous materials. However, it is very difficult to predict the characteristics of slag using existing empirical equations or conventional mathematical methods, due to the complex non-linear relationship among the phase transformation, vitrification transition and chemical composition of slag. Equipped with a strong nonlinear mapping ability, an artificial neural network may be able to predict the properties of slags if a large amount of data is available for training. In this work, over 10,000 experimental data points were used to train and develop a slag classification model (glassy vs. non-glassy) based on a neural network. The optimal structure of the neural network was figured out and validated. The results suggest that the classification accuracy for the independent test samples reached 93.3%. Using 1 and 0 as model inputs to represent mildly reducing and inert atmospheres, a double hidden layer structure in the neural network enabled the accurate classification of slags under various atmospheres. Furthermore, the neural network for the prediction of glassy slag viscosity was optimized; it featured a double hidden layer structure. Under a mildly reducing atmosphere, the absolute error from the independent test data was generally within 4 Pa center dot s. By adding a gas atmosphere into the input of the neural network using a simple normalization method, a multi-atmosphere slag viscosity prediction model was developed. Said model is much more accurate than its counterpart that does not consider the effect of the atmosphere. In summary, the artificial neural network proved to be an effective approach to predicting the slag properties under different atmospheres. The data-driven models developed in this work are expected to facilitate the commercial deployment of molten gasification technology.","artificial neural network,hazardous wastes,molten gasification,slag,viscosity",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Energy & Fuels,,3.085,"ENTRAINED-FLOW,GASIFIER,MUNICIPAL,SOLID-WASTE,COAL-WATER,SLURRY,VISCOSITY,BEHAVIOR,HIGH-TEMPERATURES,ASH,SLAG,CRYSTALLIZATION,MODEL,IRON,RICH",ENERGIES,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5115/pdf,

However, complexities in the mixture optimization of RAC due to the variability of recycled aggregates and lack of accuracy in estimating its compressive strength require novel and sophisticated techniques. This paper aims at developing state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict the RAC compressive strength and optimize its mixture design. Results show that the developed models including Gaussian processes, deep learning, and gradient boosting regression achieved robust predictive performance, with the gradient boosting regression trees yielding highest prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization coupled with gradient boosting regression trees model was developed to optimize the mixture design of RAC for various compressive strength classes. The hybrid model achieved cost-saving RAC mixture designs with lower environmental footprint for different target compressive strength classes. The model could be further harvested to achieve sustainable concrete with optimal recycled aggregate content, least cost, and least environmental footprint.","recycled aggregate concrete,machine learning,model,Gaussian process,deep learning,gradient boosting,regression trees,gated recurrent unit",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,PREDICTION,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,FLY-ASH,SILICA,FUME,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,ENGINEERING,PROPERTIES,HARDENED,PROPERTIES,CURING,CONDITIONS,DEMOLITION,WASTE,COARSE,AGGREGATE",MATERIALS,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/13/19/4331/pdf,

The proposed system is based on a lightweight deep neural network architecture composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input individual CT slices, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that takes as input multiple feature embeddings provided by the CNN. For efficient processing, we consider various feature selection methods to produce a subset of useful CNN features for the LSTM. Furthermore, we reduce the CT slices by a factor of 2x, which enables us to train the model faster. Even if our model is designed to balance speed and accuracy, we report a weighted mean log loss of 0.04989 on the final test set, which places us in the top 30 ranking (2%) from a total of 1345 participants. While our computing infrastructure does not allow it, processing CT slices at their original scale is likely to improve performance. In order to enable others to reproduce our results, we provide our code as open source. After the challenge, we conducted a subjective intracranial hemorrhage detection assessment by radiologists, indicating that the performance of our deep model is on par with that of doctors specialized in reading CT scans. Another contribution of our work is to integrate Grad-CAM visualizations in our system, providing useful explanations for its predictions. We therefore consider our system as a viable option when a fast diagnosis or a second opinion on intracranial hemorrhage detection are needed.","intracranial hemorrhage detection,intracranial hemorrhage subtype classification,convolutional neural networks,long short-term memory networks",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"DEEP-LEARNING,ALGORITHM,SEGMENTATION",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7582288,

Data imbalance can cause overfitting problems and, consequently, poor classification performance. The purpose of this study is to improve BCI performance by solving this data imbalance problem with sampling techniques. The sampling techniques were applied to BCI data in 15 subjects controlling a door lock, 15 subjects an electric light, and 14 subjects a Bluetooth speaker. We explored two categories of sampling techniques: oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling techniques, including random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), borderline-SMOTE, support vector machine (SVM) SMOTE, and adaptive synthetic sampling, were used to increase the number of samples for the class of target stimuli. Undersampling techniques, including random undersampling, neighborhood cleaning rule, Tomek's links, and weighted undersampling bagging, were used to reduce the class size of nontarget stimuli. The over- or undersampled data were classified by an SVM classifier. Overall, some oversampling techniques improved BCI performance while undersampling techniques often degraded performance. Particularly, using borderline-SMOTE yielded the highest accuracy (87.27%) and information transfer rate (8.82 bpm) across all three appliances. Moreover, borderline-SMOTE led to performance improvement, especially for poor performers. A further analysis showed that borderline-SMOTE improved SVM by generating more support vectors within the target class and enlarging margins. However, there was no difference in the accuracy between borderline-SMOTE and the method of applying the weighted regularization parameter of the SVM. Our results suggest that although oversampling improves performance of P300-based BCIs, it is not just the effect of the oversampling techniques, but rather the effect of solving the data imbalance problem.","brain&#8211,computer interfaces (BCI),electroencephalography (EEG),P300,sampling techniques,borderline-SMOTE",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"P300,BCI",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7582676,

Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported.","audio surveillance,spectrograms,CNN,SNR,multichannel",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SURVEILLANCE,SYSTEMS,RECOGNITION,CLASSIFICATION",ELECTRONICS,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/10/1593/pdf,

We aim to improve uncertainty estimates of machine learning-based pathology parsers and evaluate performance in low data settings.
Materials and methods: Our data comes from the Urologic Outcomes Database at UCSF which includes 3232 annotated prostate cancer pathology reports from 2001 to 2018. We approach 17 separate information extraction tasks, involving a wide range of pathologic features. To handle the diverse range of fields, we required 2 statistical models, a document classification method for pathologic features with a small set of possible values and a token extraction method for pathologic features with a large set of values. For each model, we used isotonic calibration to improve the model's estimates of its likelihood of being correct.
Results: Our best document classifier method, a convolutional neural network, achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.97 averaged over 12 fields and our best extraction method achieves an accuracy of 0.93 averaged over 5 fields. The performance saturates as a function of dataset size with as few as 128 data points. Furthermore, while our document classifier methods have reliable uncertainty estimates, our extraction-based methods do not, but after isotonic calibration, expected calibration error drops to below 0.03 for all extraction fields.
Conclusions: We find that when applying machine learning to pathology parsing, large datasets may not always be needed, and that calibration methods can improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates.","pathology,natural language processing,information extraction,cancer,prostate cancer,machine learning",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,,,JAMIA OPEN,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7751177,

Recently physics-driven deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to use neural networks for data-driven regularization. These methods unroll iterative optimization algorithms to solve the inverse problem objective function, by alternating between domain-specific data consistency and data-driven regularization via neural networks. The whole unrolled network is then trained end-to-end to learn the parameters of the network. Due to simplicity of data consistency updates with gradient descent steps, proximal gradient descent (PGD) is a common approach to unroll physics-driven DL reconstruction methods. However, PGD methods have slow convergence rates, necessitating a higher number of unrolled iterations, leading to memory issues in training and slower reconstruction times in testing. Inspired by efficient variants of PGD methods that use a history of the previous iterates, in this article, we propose a history-cognizant unrolling of the optimization algorithm with dense connections across iterations for improved performance. In our approach, the gradient descent steps are calculated at a trainable combination of the outputs of all the previous regularization units. We also apply this idea to unrolling variable splitting methods with quadratic relaxation. Our results in reconstruction of the fastMRI knee dataset show that the proposed history-cognizant approach reduces residual aliasing artifacts compared to its conventional unrolled counterpart without requiring extra computational power or increasing reconstruction time.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Image reconstruction,Inverse problems,Signal processing algorithms,Acceleration,Optimization,Neural networks,Inverse problems,unrolled optimization algorithms,physics-driven deep learning,neural networks,MRI reconstruction,recurrent neural networks",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,6.544,"ITERATIVE,IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION,LOW-DOSE,CT",IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978039,

Early prediction in MI cases without prior history remains to be an ongoing challenge. This article delivers a major novel contribution in the context of predictive classification of flattened T-wave MI cases. Therefore, a novel model-driven deep deterministic learning (MDDDL) approach is proposed. In MDDDL, two different data sets are used for the execution of operational activities in terms of flattened T-wave predictive classification. The first data set is the publicly available Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), and the second data set is exclusively obtained from the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Firstly, the systematic behaviour of MDDDL is defined in terms of pattern recognition of extracted features between T-wave alternans and flattened T-wave subjects, and then both data sets are merged considering data fusion approach and pre-defined conditions. Afterwards, the empirical approach is adopted in MDDDL evaluation in relation to global acceptance and state-of-the-art comparison. Finally, some qualitative improvements, such as inclusion of a backtracking factor for rapid prediction of flattened anomalies and increasing the number of features along with enhancement of fusion processes to reduce complexity, are required by the MDDDL and should be covered in future works.","Deep learning,Deep deterministic learning,Electrocardiography,Myocardial infarction,Prediction analysis,Artificial neural network",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,AUTOMATED,DETECTION,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,ECG,CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION,QUALITY",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

Trucks are still the primary modes of freight transportation to transport containers among most terminals.

In this study, we propose deep reinforcement learning to provide truck routes of a given container transport order by considering several significant factors such as order origin, destination, time window, and due date.

Deep learning is a state-of-the-art technique for MR image-based prostate cancer diagnosis, but one of major bottlenecks is the severe lack of annotated MR images. The traditional and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based data augmentation methods cannot ensure the quality and the diversity of generated training samples. In this paper, we have proposed a novel GAN model for synthesis of MR images by utilizing its powerful ability in modeling the complex data distributions. The proposed model is designed based on the architecture of deep convolutional GAN. To learn the more equivariant representation of images that is robust to the changes in the pose and spatial relationship of objects in the images, the capsule network is applied to replace CNN used in the discriminator of regular GAN. Meanwhile, the least squares loss has been adopted for both the generator and discriminator in the proposed GAN to address the vanishing gradient problem of sigmoid cross entropy loss function in regular GAN. Extensive experiments are conducted on the simulated and real MR images. The results demonstrate that the proposed capsule network-based GAN model can generate more realistic and higher quality MR images than the compared GANs. The quantitative comparisons show that among all evaluated models, the proposed GAN generally achieves the smallest Kullback-Leibler divergence values for image generation task and provides the best classification performance when it is introduced into the deep learning method for image classification task.","prostate cancer,MR image,image synthesis,GAN,capsule network",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"CANCER,REPRESENTATION,SYSTEM",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601698,

Although fast MRI sequences allow artifact free acquisition of individual 2D slices, motion commonly occurs in between slices acquisitions. Motion correction for each slice is thus very important for reconstruction of 3D fetal brain MRI, but is highly operator-dependent and time-consuming. Approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved encouraging performance on prediction of 3D motion parameters of arbitrarily oriented 2D slices, which, however, does not capitalize on important brain structural information. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-task learning framework to jointly learn the transformation parameters and tissue segmentation map of each slice, for providing brain anatomical information to guide the mapping from 2D slices to 3D volumetric space in a coarse to fine manner. In the coarse stage, the first network learns the features shared for both regression and segmentation tasks. In the refinement stage, to fully utilize the anatomical information, distance maps constructed based on the coarse segmentation are introduced to the second network. Finally, incorporation of the signed distance maps to guide the regression and segmentation together improves the performance in both tasks.

Then, given a new pair of surfaces, we can quickly infer the spherical deformation field registering one surface to the other one. We model this parametric function using three orthogonal Spherical U-Nets and use spherical transform layers to warp the spherical surfaces, while imposing smoothness constraints on the deformation field.

The optimal model is trained for establishing the mapping function between channel state information (CSI) and RIS' configuration matrix in order to maximize the achievable rate of the received signal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively approach to the theoretical value generated by centralized machine learning (ML), while protecting user' privacy.","reconfigurable intelligent surface,privacy,federated learning,achievable rate",Article,"CHINA INST COMMUNICATIONS, NO 13 WEST CHANG AN AVENUE, BEIJING, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",Telecommunications,,1.981,,CHINA COMMUNICATIONS,,

Many technologies are reaching their sensitivity limit and new approaches need to be developed to overcome the currently irreducible technological challenges. The detrimental effect of the material budget and power consumption represents a very serious concern for a high-precision silicon vertex and tracking detectors. One of the most promising areas is CMOS sensors offering low mass and potentially radiation-hard technology for the future proton-proton and electron-positron colliders, intensity frontier and heavy-ion experiments. MPGDs have become a well-established technique in the fertile field of gaseous detectors; these will remain the primary choice whenever the large-area coverage with low material budget is required. Vacuum tube technology is inherently fast and new developments include advances in microchannel plates for photomultipliers with a potential for a picosecond-time resolution in large systems. Several novel concepts of picosecond-timing detectors will have numerous powerful applications in particle identification, pile-up rejection and event reconstruction, and serve numerous scientific goals. The story of modern calorimetry is a textbook example of physics research driving the development of an experimental method. Silicon photomultipliers have seen a rapid progress in the last decade, becoming the standard solution for scintillator-based devices. The integration of advanced electronics and data transmission functionalities plays an increasingly important role and needs to be addressed. Bringing the modern algorithmic advances from the field of machine learning from offline applications to online operations and trigger systems is another major challenge. The timescales spanned by future projects in particle physics, ranging from few years to many decades, constitute a challenge in itself, in addition to the complexity and diversity of the required accelerator and detector R&D. This paper summarizes advances and recent trends in the instrumentation techniques for particle physics experiments, largely based on the presentations given at the International Conference ""Instrumentation for Colliding Beam Physics"" (INSTR-20), held at BINP Novosibirsk, Russia, from 24 to 28 February, 2020.","Accelerator Applications,Instrumentation for particle accelerators and storage rings high energy (linear accelerators, synchrotrons)",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Instruments & Instrumentation,,1.328,"TIMING,PERFORMANCE,CHAMBER,DAMAGE,TPC",JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08239,

Evaluation of genetic diversity, classification of plant genotypes, analysis of yield components, yield stability analysis, assessment of biotic and abiotic stresses, prediction of parental combinations in hybrid breeding programs, and analysis of in vitro-based biotechnological experiments are mainly performed by classical statistical methods. Despite successful applications, these classical statistical methods have low efficiency in analyzing data obtained from plant studies, as the genotype, environment, and their interaction (G x E) result in nondeterministic and nonlinear nature of plant characteristics. Large-scale data flow, including phenomics, metabolomics, genomics, and big data, must be analyzed for efficient interpretation of results affected by G x E. Nonlinear nonparametric machine learning techniques are more efficient than classical statistical models in handling large amounts of complex and nondeterministic information with ""multiple-independent variables versus multiple-dependent variables"" nature. Neural networks, partial least square regression, random forest, and support vector machines are some of the most fascinating machine learning models that have been widely applied to analyze nonlinear and complex data in both classical plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. High interpretive power of machine learning algorithms has made them popular in the analysis of plant complex multifactorial characteristics. The classification of different plant genotypes with morphological and molecular markers, modeling and predicting important quantitative characteristics of plants, the interpretation of complex and nonlinear relationships of plant characteristics, and predicting and optimizing of in vitro breeding methods are the examples of applications of machine learning in conventional plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. Precision agriculture is possible through accurate measurement of plant characteristics using imaging techniques and then efficient analysis of reliable extracted data using machine learning algorithms. Perfect interpretation of high-throughput phenotyping data is applicable through coupled machine learning-image processing. Some applied and potentially applicable capabilities of machine learning techniques in conventional and in vitro-based plant breeding studies have been discussed in this overview.

Although single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are most common, the energy ranges they permit for imaging are limited to either below 300 keV (SPECT) or to 511 keV gamma rays (PET). Recently, Compton cameras have attracted attention, owing to their wide energy range, which stretches from a few hundred keV to several MeV. In this study, we performed Compton camera image processing using four machine-learning (ML) techniques: dictionary learning, U-Net, SRGAN, and AUTOMAP. With these techniques, we tried to reduce the artifacts caused by the sparsity of statistics and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus, these ML models were trained using image pairs reconstructed from high- and low-statistics images. As a result, we succeeded in generating images similar to the ground truth from low-statistics images. We argue that this technique can be applied not only to Compton camera images but also to other radiation imaging devices. As a future perspective, we mention the possibility of applying our imaging and processing technique to in vivo imaging of alpha-particle internal therapy.","Compton imaging,Data processing methods,Image reconstruction in medical imaging,Image filtering",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Instruments & Instrumentation,,1.328,"GAMMA-RAY,PHASE,CT",JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION,,

This article collects learner data from multiple sources during an adaptive learning activity, and employs a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach to shed light to learners' engagement patterns, with respect to their learning performance. Specifically, this article measures and codes learners' engagement by fusing and compiling clickstreams (e.g., response time), physiological data (e.g., eye-tracking, electroencephalography, electrodermal activity), and survey data (e.g., goal-orientation) to determine what configurations of those data explain when learners can attain high or medium/low learning performance. For the evaluation of the approach, an empirical study with 32 undergraduates was conducted. The analysis revealed six configurations that explain learners' high performance and three that explain learners' medium/low performance, driven by engagement measures coming from the multimodal data. Since fsQCA explains the outcome of interest itself, rather than its variance, these findings advance our understanding on the combined effect of the multiple indicators of engagement on learners' performance.

Since human involvement reduces the success rate of the biological microinjection procedure, an extensive research effort has been made towards its automation. The accurate positioning of a randomly placed biological cell in the microscope's field of view is a prerequisite for any automated injection procedure. Vision is the primary source for visual servoing in microinjection applications. For this reason, a visual sensing system is required to recognise, calculate, and manipulate the cell to the desired position. In this study, eight different pretrained neural networks were analysed and used as a backbone for the YOLOv2 object detection method, and the optimal network was evaluated based on mean Intersection over Union (IoU) accuracy, average precision (AP) at different thresholds, and frame rate (fps) in our dataset. YOLOv2 with Resnet-50 model demonstrated superior performance with 89% mean IoU accuracy and 100% detection accuracy at an average of 33 fps. Ten different sets of experiments were conducted to examine the algorithm by verifying the zebrafish embryo gradual presence within the field of view to bring the zebrafish embryo to the predefined position. Experimental results demonstrated that the developed solution performed real-time with high accuracy and illustrates auto-positioning with a 100% success rate regardless of the initial position of the biological cell within the Petri dish.

Frontal X-ray and 3D scanning analysis with a clinical classification based on Cobb angle and spinal curve pattern were performed with 50 patients. Similar as in a previous study, each patient's trunk 3D reconstruction was used for an elastic registration of a reference surface mesh with fixed number of vertices. Subsequently, an asymmetry distance map between original and reflected torso was calculated. A fully connected neural network was then utilised to classify patients regarding their Cobb angle (mild, moderate, severe) and an Augmented Lehnert-Schroth (ALS) classification based on their full torso asymmetry distance map.

In this work, we proposed a novel framework to extend previous works by simultaneously decoding the temporal and category information of visual stimuli from fMRI activities.Approach.3 T fMRI data of five volunteers were acquired while they were viewing five categories of natural images with random presentation intervals. For each subject, we trained two classification-based decoding modules that were used to identify the occurrence time and semantic categories of the visual stimuli. In each module, we adopted recurrent neural network (RNN), which has proven to be highly effective for learning nonlinear representations from sequential data, for the analysis of the temporal dynamics of fMRI activity patterns. Finally, we integrated the two modules into a complete framework.Main results.The proposed framework shows promising decoding performance. The average decoding accuracy across five subjects was over 19 times the chance level. Moreover, we compared the decoding performance of the early visual cortex (eVC) and the high-level visual cortex (hVC).

Non-parametric familiar alternatives to the Cox proportional hazard regression (CPH) model include survival trees that can automatically discover certain types of coy ariatc interactions according to the survival length. The aim of this research is to study FBI influential factors by applying survival trees.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 610 married women (aged 15-49 years), were selected from different regions of Tehran, Iran in the Winter and Spring of 2017. Classification and regression trees (CART) for the FBI survival tree were fitted by taking into consideration the predictors of each woman's age, age at first marriage, educational level, partner's educational level, activity, region, house ownership, kinship, partner's race, marriage time attitude, and expenditure using R packages.
Results: Since the PH assumption of the CPH model was not confirmed for the covariates of age at first marriage (P=0.001), kinship (P=0.000), partner's race (P=0.001), and marriage time attitude (P=0.042), the results of this model were not valid. Thus, a CART survival tree was fitted. The validity of the fitted model in assessing FBI was confirmed by the significant result of the log rank test (P<0.01) for the terminal nodes and the value of the separation measure, which was greater than 1. The fitted tree had 13 terminal nodes and the most vital FBI predictor was women's age. The longest FBI belonged to educated and employed women, ages 30-37 years.
Conclusion: Analysing patterns of birth spacing by selecting the appropriate statistical method provides important information for health policymakers.

Using CT as the labeled source domain, our approach learns to segment multi-modal (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) MRI having no labeled data.

The VAE constrains the style feature encoding to match a universal prior (Gaussian) that is assumed to span the styles of all the source and target modalities. The extracted image style is converted into a latent style scaling code, which modulates the generator to produce multi-modality images according to the target domain code from the image content features. Finally, we introduce a joint distribution matching discriminator that combines the translated images with task-relevant segmentation probability maps to further constrain and regularize image-to-image (I2I) translations. We performed extensive comparisons to multiple state-of-the-art I2I translation and segmentation methods.

Accurate identification of erythema migrans allows for early diagnosis and treatment, which avoids the potential for later neurologic, rheumatologic, and cardiac complications of Lyme disease. We develop and test several deep learning models for detecting erythema migrans versus several other clinically relevant skin conditions, including cellulitis, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, lesions due to tick bites and insect bites, as well as non-pathogenic normal skin. We consider a set of clinically-relevant binary and multiclass classification problems of increasing complexity. We train the DL models on a combination of publicly available images and test on public images as well as images obtained in the clinical setting. We report performance metrics that measure agreement with a gold standard, as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. On public images, we find that the DL system has an accuracy ranging from 71.58% (and 95% error margin equal to 3.77%) for an 8-class problem of EM versus 7 other classes including other skin pathologies, insect bites and normal skin, to 94.23% (3.66%) for a binary problem of EM vs. non-pathological skin.

A Kinect V2 sensor collected position data from 31 physically active males as they performed bilateral squat, forward lunge, and single-leg squat; and the movement quality was rated according to the MCS criteria. Features were extracted and selected from domain knowledge-based kinematic variables as model input. Multiclass logistic regression (MLR) was then performed to translate joint kinematics into MCS score.

Early carotid plaque monitoring can help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Manual ultrasound plaque classification and characterization methods are time-consuming and can be imprecise due to significant variations in tissue characteristics. We report a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based plaque tissue classification and characterization system.
Methods: We hypothesize that symptomatic plaque is hypoechoic due to its large lipid core and minimal collagen, as well as its heterogeneous makeup. Meanwhile, asymptomatic plaque is hyperechoic due to its small lipid core, abundant collagen, and the fact that it is often calcified. We designed a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system consisting of three kinds of deep learning (DL) classification paradigms: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Visual Geometric Group-16 (VGG16), and transfer learning, (tCNN). DCNN was 3-D optimized by varying the number of CNN layers and data augmentation frameworks. The DL systems were benchmarked against four types of machine learning (ML) classification systems, and the CADx system was characterized using two novel strategies consisting of DL mean feature strength (MFS) and a bispectrum model using higher-order spectra.
Results: After balancing symptomatic and asymptomatic plaque classes, a five-fold augmentation process was applied, yielding 1000 carotid scans in each class. Then, using a K10 protocol (trained to test the ratio of 90%10%), tCNN and DCNN yielded accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) pairs of 83.33%, 0.833 (p < 0.0001) and 95.66%, 0.956 (p < 0.0001), respectively. DCNN was superior to ML by 7.01%. As part of the characterization process, the MFS of the symptomatic plaque was found to be higher compared to the asymptomatic plaque by 17.5% (p < 0.0001). A similar pattern was seen in the bispectrum, which was higher for symptomatic plaque by 5.4% (p < 0.0001). It took <2 s to perform the online CADx process on a supercomputer.
Conclusions: The performance order of the three AI systems was DCNN > tCNN > ML. Bispectrum-based on higher-order spectra proved a powerful paradigm for plaque tissue characterization. Overall, the AI-based systems offer a powerful solution for plaque tissue classification and characterization.","Atherosclerosis,Carotid plaque,ultrasound,symptomatic,Asymptomatic,Artificial intelligence,Machine learning,deep learning,Performance,Supercomputer,Accuracy,And speed",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,INTIMA-MEDIA,THICKNESS,TISSUE,CHARACTERIZATION,ATHEROSCLEROTIC,PLAQUE,STROKE,RISK,TEXTURE,FEATURES,DISEASE,STENOSIS,ACCURATE",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study, therefore, purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images.
Methods: A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
Results: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively.
Conclusion: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19, this framework will help patients with upper respiratory symptoms to improve convenience in diagnosis and reduce transmission.","Pharyngitis,Tonsillitis,Deep learning,Smartphone,Automated diagnosis,Telemedicine",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,CANCER,COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7440230,

76,A Deep Learning Framework for Hybrid Beamforming Without Instantaneous CSI Feedback,69,10,11743-11755,Elbir Ahmet M.,Elbir AM,Elbir AM,10.1109/TVT.2020.3017652,Duzce University,"Hybrid beamformer design plays very crucial role in the next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Previous works assume the perfect channel state information (CSI) which results heavy feedback overhead. To lower complexity, channel statistics can be utilized such that only infrequent update of the channel information is needed. To reduce the complexity and provide robustness, in this work, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework to deal with both hybrid beamforming and channel estimation. For this purpose, we introduce three deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We assume that the base station (BS) has the channel statistics only and feeds the channel covariance matrix into a CNN to obtain the hybrid precoders. At the receiver, two CNNs are employed. The first one is used for channel estimation purposes and the another is employed to design the hybrid combiners. The proposed DL framework does not require the instantaneous feedback of the CSI at the BS. We have also investigated the online deployment of DL for channel estimation. We have shown that the proposed approach has higher spectral efficiency with comparison to the conventional techniques. The trained CNN structures do not need to be re-trained due to the changes in the propagation environment such as the deviations in the number of received paths and the fluctuations in the received path angles up to 4 degrees. Also, the proposed DL framework exhibits at least 10 times lower computational complexity as compared to the conventional optimization-based approaches.","Standards,Smoothing methods,Uncertainty,Bills of materials,Time measurement,Deep learning,online learning,channel estimation,hybrid precoding,instantaneous feedback",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Telecommunications,Transportation",,5.429,"MILLIMETER-WAVE,COMMUNICATIONS,MASSIVE,MIMO,SYSTEMS,CHANNEL,ESTIMATION,ANTENNA,SELECTION,COMBINER,DESIGN,PHASE,SHIFTERS,PRECODER,OPTIMIZATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10971,

Approach: The approach leverages digital biomarkers and recent advances in machine learning (ML) for mass AF diagnosis from overnight-hours of single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Four databases, totaling n = 3088 patients and p = 26 913 h of continuous single-channel electrocardiogram raw data were used. Three of the databases (n = 125, p = 2513) were used for training a ML model in recognizing AF events from beat-to-beat time series. Visit 1 of the sleep heart health study database (SHHS1, n = 2963, p = 24 400) was used as the test set to evaluate the feasibility of identifying prominent AF from polysomnographic recordings. By combining AF diagnosis history and a cardiologist's visual inspection of individuals suspected of having AF (n = 118), a total of 70 patients were diagnosed with prominent AF in SHHS1. Main results: Model prediction on SHHS1 showed an overall Se = 0.97, Sp = 0.99, NPV = 0.99 and PPV = 0.67 in classifying individuals with or without prominent AF. PPV was non-inferior (p = 0.03) for individuals with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 15 versus AHI < 15. Over 22% of correctly identified prominent AF rhythm cases were not previously documented as AF in SHHS1. Significance: Individuals with prominent AF can be automatically diagnosed from an overnight single-channel ECG recording, with an accuracy unaffected by the presence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. This approach enables identifying a large proportion of AF individuals that were otherwise missed by regular care.","medicine during sleep,atrial fibrillation,digital biomarkers,machine learning,obstructive sleep apnea",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,2.866,STROKE,PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14686,

Esophageal pressure manometry (EPM) based estimation of consecutive peak to trough differences (Delta Pes) is the gold standard method to quantify the severity of airway obstructions. However, the procedure is rarely available in sleep laboratories due to invasive nature. There is a clinical need for a simplified, scalable technology that can quantify the severity of airway obstructions. In this paper, we address this and propose a pioneering technology, centered on sleep related respiratory sound (SRS) to predict overnight Delta Pes signal. Approach: We recorded streams of SRS using a bedside iPhone 7 smartphone from subjects undergoing diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) studies and EPM was performed concurrently. Overnight data was divided into epochs of 10 s duration with 50% overlap. Altogether, we extracted 42 181 such epochs from 13 subjects. Acoustic features and features from the two PSG signals serve as an input to train a machine learning algorithm to achieve mapping between non-invasive features and Delta Pes values. A testing dataset of 14 171 epochs from four new subjects was used for validation. Main results: The SRS based model predicted the Delta Pes with a median of absolute error of 6.75 cmH2O (+/- 0.59, r = 0.83(+/- 0.03)). When information from the PSG were combined with the SRS, the model performance became: 6.37cmH2O (+/- 1.02, r = 0.85(+/- 0.04)). Significance: The smart phone based SRS alone, or in combination with routinely collected PSG signals can provide a non-invasive method to predict overnight Delta Pes. The method has the potential to be automated and scaled to provide a low-cost alternative to EPM.","OSA snoring sounds,upper airway obstruction,esophageal pressure signal,airway obstruction severity analysis",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,2.866,"APNEA-HYPOPNEA,INDEX,SLEEP-APNEA,ASSOCIATION,RISK",PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,,

Materials and Methods: Binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier ensembles were trained and validated using balanced datasets of critical incident report texts (n_type = 2860, n_severity = 1160) collected from a state-wide reporting system. Generalizability was evaluated on different and independent hospital-level reporting system. Concepts were extracted from report narratives using the UMLS Metathesaurus, and their relevance and frequency were used as semantic features. Performance was evaluated by F-score, Hamming loss, and exact match score and was compared with SVM ensembles using bag-of-words (BOW) features on 3 testing datasets (type/severity: n_benchmark = 286/116, n_original = 444/4837, n_independent =6000/5950).
Results: SVMs using semantic features met or outperformed those based on BOW features to identify 10 different incident types (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 82.6%/69.4%; original = 77.9%/68.8%; independent = 78.0%/67.4%) and extreme-risk events (F-score [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 87.3%/87.3%; original = 25.5%/19.8%; independent = 49.6%/52.7%). For incident type, the exact match score for semantic classifiers was consistently higher than BOW across all test datasets (exact match [semantics/BOW]: benchmark = 48.9%/39.9%; original = 57.9%/44.4%; independent = 59.5%/34.9%). Discussion: BOW representations are not ideal for the automated identification of incident reports because they do not account for text semantics. UMLS semantic representations are likely to better capture information in report narratives, and thus may explain their superior performance.
Conclusions: UMLS-based semantic classifiers were effective in identifying incidents by type and extreme-risk events, providing better generalizability than classifiers using BOW.","UMLS,semantics,patient safety,incident reporting,text classification,natural language processing",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,5.178,"CLASSIFICATION,QUALITY",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa082,

Although clinical data in their raw form can be used directly for predictive modeling, it is a common practice to map data to standard terminologies to facilitate data aggregation and reuse. There is, however, a lack of systematic investigation of how different representations could affect the performance of predictive models, especially in the context of machine learning and deep learning.
Materials and Methods: We projected the input diagnoses data in the Cerner HealthFacts database to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and 5 other terminologies, including CCS, CCSR, ICD-9, ICD-10, and Phe-WAS, and evaluated the prediction performances of these terminologies on 2 different tasks: the risk prediction of heart failure in diabetes patients and the risk prediction of pancreatic cancer. Two popular models were evaluated: logistic regression and a recurrent neural network.
Results: For logistic regression, using UMLS delivered the optimal area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) results in both dengue hemorrhagic fever (81.15%) and pancreatic cancer (80.53%) tasks.

Studying the development of the chondrocranium (the part of the endoskeleton that protects the brain and other sense organs) is crucial to understanding genotype-phenotype relationships and early detection of skeletal malformation. Our goal is to segment craniofacial cartilages in 3D micro-CT images of embryonic mice stained with phosphotungstic acid. However, due to high image resolution, complex object structures, and low contrast, delineating fine-grained structures in these images is very challenging, even manually. Specifically, only experts can differentiate cartilages, and it is unrealistic to manually label whole volumes for deep learning model training. We propose a new framework to progressively segment cartilages in high-resolution 3D micro-CT images using extremely sparse annotation (e.g., annotating only a few selected slices in a volume). Our model consists of a lightweight fully convolutional network (FCN) to accelerate the training speed and generate pseudo labels (PLs) for unlabeled slices. Meanwhile, we take into account the reliability of PLs using a bootstrap ensemble based uncertainty quantification method. Further, our framework gradually learns from the PLs with the guidance of the uncertainty estimation via self-training. Experiments show that our method achieves high segmentation accuracy compared to prior arts and obtains performance gains by iterative self-training.",Cartilage segmentation; Sparse annotation; Uncertainty,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

In this respect, this study aimed to characterise the structure of an EPS from Leuconstoc mesenteroides DL1 strain and to optimise the EPS production by determination of the effects of incubation time, sucrose concentration, incubation temperature and initial levan concentration (input parameters) using integrated ANNs (Artificial neural networks) and fuzzy modelling approaches. The characterisation of the EPS monomeric composition by HPLC analysis revealed that EPS DL1 was composed of glucose and fructose. The H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of EPS DL1 also confirmed the glucan and fructan production. The effects of the input parameters on glucan and fructan production levels as output parameters by DL1 were optimised using neural network and fuzzy modelling tools. The fuzzy model was developed based on the recognition of basic elements of input-output parameters, and the power of ANNs used for system identification. A structural analysis was carried out to improve the flexibility of fuzzy model, and to design the unknown mappings of the input and output parameters more robustly. The parameters then were fine-tuned by qualitative reasoning to establish the relations of input output parameters using membership functions (MFs) and their intervals determination. A hybrid training algorithm was employed for parameter identification, MFs and their interval determination to obtain the fuzzy model. The model can predict the outcome parameters; glucan and fructan with high accuracy for the predetermined input parameters.","EPS production,Structural characterisation,Lactic acid bacteria (LAB),Optimisation,Neural networks,Fuzzy modelling",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,5.518,"STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION,LACTOBACILLUS-PLANTARUM,WEISSELLA-CIBARIA,SOURDOUGH,GLUCAN,OPTIMIZATION,DEXTRAN,GLUCANSUCRASE,PREDICTION,BACTERIA",COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,,

Adequate friction is essential for a vehicle to safely maneuver. Inadequate friction is directly correlated to the accident hazard, particularly in wet weather conditions. Quality of pavement materials has a prodigious effect on skid resistance and high-quality materials allow adequate pavement frictional resistance for an extended period. Science evaluation of frictional characteristics depends on physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of the aggregate, type of mix, binder/bitumen content, water film thickness, etc., and it necessities a costly and time-consuming test protocol. In the present research, a model is developed for the evaluation of skid resistance in terms of the British pendulum number (BPN), using experimental observations, with the aid of machine learning tools. In the present work, group method of data handling (GMDH) and multigene symbolic genetic programming (MSGP) have been used to model the BPN. Developed model is capable to simplify extremely nonlinear deviations in data as well as forecast the frictional performance from experimental data. It is also found that the performance of the MSGP (R-2 = 0.99) is more encouraging and better than that of the GMDH model (R-2 = 0.98) for the prediction of BPN.

Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) and wireless inertial measurement units (IMU) allow the realization of experimental data recording with improved ecological validity where the subjects can be carrying out natural activities while data recording is minimally invasive. Specifically, we aim to show that EEG and IMU data fusion allows improved human activity recognition in a natural setting. We have defined an experimental protocol composed of natural sitting, standing and walking activities, and we have recruited subjects in two sites: in-house (N = 4) and out-house (N = 12) populations with different demographics. Experimental protocol data capture was carried out with validated commercial systems. Classifier model training and validation were carried out with scikit-learn open source machine learning python package. EEG features consist of the amplitude of the standard EEG frequency bands. Inertial features were the instantaneous position of the body tracked points after a moving average smoothing to remove noise. We carry out three validation processes: a 10-fold cross-validation process per experimental protocol repetition, (b) the inference of the ethograms, and (c) the transfer learning from each experimental protocol repetition to the remaining repetitions. The in-house accuracy results were lower and much more variable than the out-house sessions results. In general, random forest was the best performing classifier model. Best cross-validation results, ethogram accuracy, and transfer learning were achieved from the fusion of EEG and IMUs data. Transfer learning behaved poorly compared to classification on the same protocol repetition, but it has accuracy still greater than 0.75 on average for the out-house data sessions. Transfer leaning accuracy among repetitions of the same subject was above 0.88 on average. Ethogram prediction accuracy was above 0.96 on average. Therefore, we conclude that wireless EEG and IMUs allow for the definition of natural experimental designs with high ecological validity toward human computational neuroethology research. The fusion of both EEG and IMUs signals improves activity and ethogram recognition.","Neuroethology,activity recognition,EEG,inertial measurement",Article,"WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD, 5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,5.439,"EEG,TRACKING,ACCURACY,SYSTEM,FIELD",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0129065720500537,

Pattern-recognition-based myocontrol can be unreliable, which may limit its use in the clinical practice and everyday activities. One cause for this is the poor generalization of the underlying machine learning models to untrained conditions. Acquiring the training data and building the model more interactively can reduce this problem. For example, the user could be encouraged to target the model's instabilities during the data acquisition supported by automatic feedback guidance. Interactivity is an emerging trend in myocontrol of upper-limb electric prostheses: the user should be actively involved throughout the training and usage of the device.
Approach. In this study, 18 non-disabled participants tested two novel feedback-aided acquisition protocols against a standard one that did not provide any guidance. All the protocols acquired data dynamically in multiple arm positions to counteract the limb position effect. During feedback-aided acquisition, an acoustic signal urged the participant to hover with the arm in specific regions of her peri-personal space, de facto acquiring more data where needed. The three protocols were compared on everyday manipulation tasks performed with a prosthetic hand. Main results. Our results showed that feedback-aided data acquisition outperformed the acquisition routine without guidance, both objectively and subjectively. Significance. This indicates that the interaction with the user during the data acquisition is fundamental to improve myocontrol.","myoelectric control,training data acquisition,feedback guidance,limb position effect,prosthetic hand",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology",,5.484,"PATTERN-RECOGNITION,LIMB,LOSS",JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING,,

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) involves a large number of sensors allowing better spatiotemporal resolution for assessing brain activity patterns. There have been many efforts to develop BCI using MEG with high accuracy, though an increase in the number of channels (NoC) means an increase in computational complexity. However, not all sensors necessarily contribute significantly to an increase in classification accuracy (CA) and specifically in the case of MEG-based BCI no channel selection methodology has been performed. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of channel selection on the performance of MEG-based BCI. Approach. MEG data were recorded for two sessions from 15 healthy participants performing motor imagery, cognitive imagery and a mixed imagery task pair using a unique paradigm. Performance of four state-of-the-art channel selection methods (i.e. Class-Correlation, ReliefF, Random Forest, and Infinite Latent Feature Selection were applied across six binary tasks in three different frequency bands) were evaluated in this study on two state-of-the-art features, i.e. bandpower and common spatial pattern (CSP). Main results. All four methods provided a statistically significant increase in CA compared to a baseline method using all gradiometer sensors, i.e. 204 channels with band-power features from alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or broadband (alpha + beta) (8-30 Hz). It is also observed that the alpha frequency band performed better than the beta and broadband frequency bands. The performance of the beta band gave the lowest CA compared with the other two bands. Channel selection improved accuracy irrespective of feature types. Moreover, all the methods reduced the NoC significantly, from 204 to a range of 1-25, using bandpower as a feature and from 15 to 105 for CSP. The optimal channel number also varied not only in each session but also for each participant. Reducing the NoC will help to decrease the computational cost and maintain numerical stability in cases of low trial numbers. Significance. The study showed significant improvement in performance of MEG-BCI with channel selection irrespective of feature type and hence can be successfully applied for BCI applications.","MEG,BCI,bandpower,CSP,channel selection",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology",,5.484,"BRAIN-COMPUTER,INTERFACES,EEG,PLASTICITY,EXECUTION,MOVEMENT",JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING,https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/abbd21,

With the rapid advancements of medical technologies and patients' higher expectations for precision diagnostic and surgical outcomes, gastroscopy has been increasingly adopted for the detection and treatment of pathologies in the upper digestive tract. Correspondingly, robotic gastroscopes with advanced functionalities, e.g., disposable, dextrous and not invasive solutions, have been developed in the last years. This article extensively reviews these novel devices and describes their functionalities and performance. In addition, the implementation of artificial intelligence technology into robotic gastroscopes, combined with remote telehealth endoscopy services, are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear and comprehensive view of contemporary robotic gastroscopes and ancillary technologies to support medical practitioners in their future clinical practice but also to inspire and drive new engineering developments.
Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor-patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists' and nurses' burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients' preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.","gastroscopy,gastric cancer,robotic gastroscopy,machine learning,artificial intelligence",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Oncology,,6.999,"ENDOSCOPIC,SUBMUCOSAL,DISSECTION,UPPER,GASTROINTESTINAL,ENDOSCOPY,GASTRIC-CANCER,CAPSULE,ENDOSCOPY,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,TRANSORAL,SURGERY,RISK-FACTORS,SYSTEM,GASTROENTEROLOGY,STOMACH",CANCERS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600666,

However, more comprehensive and reliable insights can be gained if different modalities/views of biomedical data are considered. However, in most multi-view cases, each view contains some missing data, leading to incomplete multi-view clustering. In this study, we have presented a deep Boltzmann machine-based incomplete multi-view clustering framework for gene clustering. Here, we seek to regenerate the data of the three NCBI datasets in the incomplete modalities using Shape Boltzmann Machines. The overall performance of the proposed multi-view clustering technique has been evaluated using the Silhouette index and Davies-Bouldin index, and the comparative analysis shows an improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

A significant challenge is to explore innovative methods for further exploitation of these large-scale datasets. The approach described in this paper utilizes the results of RNAseq analysis to identify biomarkers related to the disease and deploy a disease outcome predictive model.
Method: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) was used as an example in the implementation of this approach. The approach proposed follows this methodology: (1) Analysis of RNAseq raw data, (2) Construction of a gene correlation network, (3) Identification of modules and hub genes in this network, which constitute the features for the classification algorithm, (4) Deployment of an efficient predictive model, with the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and the association of the indicators with the clinical information.
Results: The features/hub genes finally selected were 25 in total and were used as the input to the classifiers. The models, then, were validated leading to very satisfactory results, with the best performing of them achieving 95% cross-validation and 93,75% external validation accuracy.
Conclusions: Concluding, this exploratory data-driven approach attempts to make use of big genomic data by summarizing them in a way that is more understandable and facilitates their use by other techniques, such as Machine Learning. This method manages to extract a gene set that can predict the disease progression. The validation results of the proposed data-driven predictive models are very promising and constitute a significant contribution to medical research and personalized medicine.","Bioinformatics,Sequencing analysis,Co-expression networks,Data mining,Machine learning",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,,"RNA-SEQ,GENE,EXPRESSION,MUTATION",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

Advanced physics-based plasticity models usually feature numerous internal variables (often of tensorial nature) along with a set of evolution equations and complementary conditions. In the present work, an attempt is made to come up with a machine-learning based model that can replicate the predictions anisotropic Yld2000-2d model with homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH). For this, a series of modeling problems of increasing complexity is formulated and sequentially addressed using neural network models. It is demonstrated that basic fully-connected neural network models can capture the characteristic non-linearities in the uniaxial stress-strain response such as the Bauschinger effect, permanent softening or latent hardening. A neural network with gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully-connected layer is proposed for the modeling of plane stress plasticity for arbitrary loading paths. After training and testing the model through comparison with the Yld200 0-2d/HAH model, the recurrent neural network model is also used to model the multi-axial stress-strain response of a two-dimensional foam.

Implemented as a graph neural network with physics-based regularization in latent space, the model enables effective training with smaller data sizes. For training and validation of the model, we used longitudinal tau measures from positron emission tomography (PET) and structural connectivity graphs from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. The model led to higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower mean squared error levels than both an unregularized graph neural network and a differential equation solver.
