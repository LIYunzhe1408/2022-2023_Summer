Traditional synthesis methods, such as GE's MAGiC platform, employ a model-fitting approach to generate parameter-weighted contrasts. However, models' over-simplification, as well as imperfections in the acquisition, can lead to undesirable reconstruction artifacts, especially in T2-FLAIR contrast. To improve the image quality, in this study, a multi-task deep learning model is developed to synthesize multi-contrast neuroimaging jointly using both signal relaxation relationships and spatial information. Compared with previous deep learning-based synthesis, the correlation between different destination contrast is utilized to enhance reconstruction quality. To improve model generalizability and evaluate clinical significance, the proposed model was trained and tested on a large multi-center dataset, including healthy subjects and patients with pathology. Results from both quantitative comparison and clinical reader study demonstrate that the multi-task formulation leads to more efficient and accurate contrast synthesis than previous methods.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Generators,Machine learning,Generative adversarial networks,Training,Image reconstruction,Pathology,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),image synthesis,generative adversarial network (GAN),deep learning (DL),image fusion",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"ATTENUATION,CORRECTION,PROTON-DENSITY,SYNTHETIC-MRI,BRAIN,QUANTIFICATION,NETWORK",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

For the purposes of surgical planning, we design the first automatic approach to detect and segment the intrauterine cavity from axial, sagittal and coronal MRI stacks. Our methodology relies on the ability of capsule networks to successfully capture the part-whole interdependency of objects in the scene, particularly for unique class instances (i.e., intrauterine cavity). The presented deep Q-CapsNet reinforcement learning framework is built upon a context-adaptive detection policy to generate a bounding box of the womb. A capsule architecture is subsequently designed to segment (or refine) the whole intrauterine cavity. This network is coupled with a strided nnU-Net feature extractor, which encodes discriminative feature maps to construct strong primary capsules. The method is robustly evaluated with and without the localization stage using 13 performance measures, and directly compared with 15 state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on 71 singleton and monochorionic twin pregnancies. An average Dice score above 0.91 is achieved for all ablations, revealing the potential of our approach to be used in clinical practice.","Cavity resonators,Magnetic resonance imaging,Feature extraction,Image segmentation,Motion segmentation,Forestry,Lung,Fetal surgery,twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome,MRI,intrauterine cavity segmentation,capsules,q-learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,MRI,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

Previous studies have indicated that BAC may provide evidence of general atherosclerotic vascular disease, and potentially be a useful marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Currently, there is no technique in use for the automatic detection of BAC in mammograms. Since a majority of women over the age of 40 already undergo breast cancer screening with mammography, detecting BAC may offer a method to screen women for CVD in a way that is effective, efficient, and broad reaching, at no additional cost or radiation. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for detecting BACs in mammograms. Inspired by the promising results achieved using the U-Net model in many biomedical segmentation problems and the DenseNet in semantic segmentation, we extend the U-Net model with dense connectivity to automatically detect BACs in mammograms. The presented model helps to facilitate the reuse of computation and improve the flow of gradients, leading to better accuracy and easier training of the model. We evaluate the performance using a set of full-field digital mammograms collected and prepared for this task from a publicly available dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented model outperforms human experts as well as the other related deep learning models. This confirms the effectiveness of our model in the BACs detection task, which is a promising step in providing a cost-effective risk assessment tool for CVD.","Mammography,Task analysis,Image segmentation,Feature extraction,Solid modeling,Biological system modeling,Computational modeling,Cardiovascular,deep learning,mammogram,segmentation U-Net",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"DISEASE,RISK,SEGMENTATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

Further gains in temporal resolution can potentially be achieved via partial data acquisition, though a priori knowledge on the acquired data is essential for rendering accurate reconstructions using compressed sensing approaches. In this work, we suggest a machine learning method based on principal component analysis for high-frame-rate volumetric cardiac imaging using only a few tomographic optoacoustic projections. The method is particularly effective for discerning periodic motion, as demonstrated herein by non-invasive imaging of a beating mouse heart. A training phase enables efficiently compressing the heart motion information, which is subsequently used as prior information for image reconstruction from sparse sampling at a higher frame rate. It is shown that image quality is preserved with a 64-fold reduction in the data flow. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the volumetric motion could effectively be captured by relying on time-resolved data from a single optoacoustic detector. Feasibility of capturing transient (non-periodic) events not registered in the training phase is further demonstrated by visualizing perfusion of a contrast agent in vivo. The suggested approach can be used to significantly boost the temporal resolution of optoacoustic imaging and facilitate development of more affordable and data efficient systems.","Image reconstruction,Training,Principal component analysis,Three-dimensional displays,Data acquisition,Tomography,Image acquisition,image reconstruction,image restoration,machine learning,optoacoustic imaging",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"PHOTOACOUSTIC,TOMOGRAPHY",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/20.500.11850/446009/3/09102986.pdf,

One of the key contributions of this method is a double-layer representation consisting of a complete parametric body model inside, and a gradually fused detailed surface outside. A pre-defined node graph on the body parameterizes the non-rigid deformations near the body, and a free-form dynamically changing graph parameterizes the outer surface layer far from the body, which allows more general reconstruction. We further propose a joint motion tracking method based on the double-layer representation to enable robust and fast motion tracking performance. Moreover, the inner parametric body is optimized online and forced to fit inside the outer surface layer as well as the live depth input. Overall, our method enables increasingly denoised, detailed and complete surface reconstructions, fast motion tracking performance and plausible inner body shape reconstruction in real-time.

We propose a new deep learning-based boundary detection and compensation (DL-BDC) technique in ultrasound (US) imaging. It can segment vessel boundaries by harnessing the convolutional neural network and wall motion compensation in the analysis of near-wall flow dynamics. The network enables training from real and synthetic US images together. The performance of the technique is validated through synthetic US images and tissue-mimicking phantom experiments. The neural network performs well with high Dice coefficients of over 0.94 and 0.9 for lumens and walls, outperforming previous segmentation techniques. Then, the performance of the wall motion compensation is examined for compliant phantoms. When DL-BDC is applied to flow influenced by wall motion, root-mean-square errors are less than 0.07%. The technique is utilized to analyze flow dynamics and wall interaction with varying elastic moduli of the phantoms. The results show that the flow dynamics and wall shear stress values are consistent with the expected values of the compliant phantoms, and their wall motion behavior is observed with pulse wave propagation. This strategy makes US imaging capable of simultaneous measurement of blood flow and vessel dynamics in human arteries for their accurate interaction analysis. DL-BDC can segment vessel walls fast, accurately, and robustly. It enables to measure the near-wall flow precisely by determining the vessel boundary dynamics. This approach can be beneficial in flow dynamics and wall interaction analyses in various biomedical applications.","Image segmentation,Phantoms,Dynamics,Blood flow,Speckle,Imaging phantoms,Artificial neural networks,carotid artery,fluid flow measurement,image segmentation,wall dynamics",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Acoustics,Engineering",,2.752,"MOTION,PRESSURE,HEART,TIME,VIVO",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL,,

Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine patients with 84 solid renal masses (21 benign; 63 malignant) from a single center were included in this retrospective study. Malignant masses included common renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes: clear cell RCC, papillary cell RCC, and chromophobe RCC. Benign masses are represented by oncocytomas and fat-poor angiomyolipomas. Following preprocessing steps, a total of 271 texture features were extracted from unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT images. Dimension reduction was done with a reliability analysis and then with a feature selection algorithm. A nested-approach was used for feature selection, model optimization, and validation. Eight ML algorithms were used for the classifications: decision tree, locally weighted teaming, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network, and random forest.
Results: The number of features with good reproducibility was 198 for unenhanced CT and 244 for contrast-enhanced CT. Random forest algorithm demonstrated the best predictive performance using five selected contrast-enhanced CT texture features. The accuracy and area under the curve metrics were 90.5% and 0.915, respectively. Having eliminated the highly collinear features from the analysis, the accuracy and area under the curve values slightly increased to 91.7% and 0.916, respectively.

Many attempts have been experimented to identify the infection with COVID-19. The X-ray images were one of the attempts to detect the influence of COVID-19 on the infected persons from involving those experiments. According to the X-ray analysis, bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities can be caused by COVID-19 - sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. But unfortunately, the specification or if the person infected with COVID-19 or not is so hard under the X-ray images. X-ray images could be classified using the machine learning techniques to specify if the person infected severely, mild, or not infected. To improve the classification accuracy of the machine learning, the region of interest within the image that contains the features of COVID-19 must be extracted. This problem is called the image segmentation problem (ISP). Many techniques have been proposed to overcome ISP. The most commonly used technique due to its simplicity, speed, and accuracy are threshold-based segmentation. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach based on the thresholding technique to overcome ISP for COVID-19 chest X-ray images by integrating a novel meta-heuristic algorithm known as a slime mold algorithm (SMA) with the whale optimization algorithm to maximize the Kapur's entropy. The performance of integrated SMA has been evaluated on 12 chest X-ray images with threshold levels up to 30 and compared with five algorithms: Lshade algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), FireFly algorithm (FFA), Harris-hawks algorithm (HHA), salp swarm algorithms (SSA), and the standard SMA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms SMA under Kapur's entropy for all the metrics used and the standard SMA could perform better than the other algorithms in the comparison under all the metrics.

In MIL, a common assumption is that negative bags contain only negative instances while positive bags contain one or more positive instances. This asymmetric assumption may be inappropriate for some application scenarios where negative bags also contain representative negative instances. We introduce a novel symmetric MIL framework associating each instance in a bag with an attribute which can be either negative, positive, or irrelevant. We extend the notion of relevance by introducing control over the number of relevant instances.

X-ray images are often used for guidance, but important structures may be not well visible. These structures can be overlaid from pre-operative 3-D images and accurate alignment can be established using 2-D/3-D registration. Registration based on the point-to-plane correspondence model was recently proposed and shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, registration may still fail in challenging cases due to a large portion of outliers. In this paper, we describe a learning-based correspondence weighting scheme to improve the registration performance. By learning an attention model, inlier correspondences get higher attention in the motion estimation while the outlier correspondences are suppressed. Instead of using per-correspondence labels, our objective function allows to train the model directly by minimizing the registration error. We demonstrate a highly increased robustness, e.g. increasing the success rate from 84.9% to 97.0% for spine registration. In contrast to previously proposed learning-based methods, we also achieve a high accuracy of around 0.5mm mean re-projection distance. In addition, our method requires a relatively small amount of training data, is able to learn from simulated data, and generalizes to images with additional structures which are not present during training. Furthermore, a single model can be trained for both, different views and different anatomical structures.","Robustness,Training,X-ray imaging,Motion estimation,Linear programming,Optimization,Training data,Rigid 2-D,3-D registration,point-to-plane correspondence model,deep learning,attention model,spine registration,head registration",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"IMAGE,REGISTRATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

To overcome the imperfections of the KDAs and DDMs, we suggest a composite scheme by combining them, which not only alleviates the optimization burden but also presents a remarkable generalization and accuracy. This composite scheme as an example is applied to design one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) from the transmission spectra, which first determines the 1DPC type by a classification neural network, then predicts the layer thicknesses of that 1DPC by a generative adversarial network (GAN), and finally further optimizes the layer thicknesses by the KDA that is based on the method of least squares and starts from the results of the KDA. Numerical results yield that the third step can improve more than 12% for the prediction accuracy with respect to the GAN for complex 1DPCs, resulting in the overall successful prediction probability being able to reach 96.8%. Since the scheme combines the KDAs and DDMs, it has remarkable generalization and high accuracy and provides a potential alternative for the efficient inverse design.","inverse optical design,machine learning,neural network",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Optics,,2.402,"DEEP,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SYSTEMS,COHERENT,LIGHT",JOURNAL OF OPTICS,,

However, additively manufactured parts, including lattices, exhibit a higher variability in their mechanical properties than wrought materials, placing more stringent demands on inspection, part quality verification, and product qualification. Previous research on anomaly detection has primarily focused on using in-situ monitoring of the additive manufacturing process or post-process (ex-situ) x-ray computed tomography. In this work, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNN), a machine learning algorithm, can directly predict the energy required to compressively deform gyroid and octet truss metamaterials using only optical images. Using the filed nature of engineered lattices, the relatively small data set (43 to 48 lattices) can be augmented by systematically subdividing the original image into many smaller sub-images. During testing of the CNN, the prediction from these sub-images can be combined using an ensemble-like technique to predict the deformation work of the entire lattice. This approach provides a fast and inexpensive screening tool for predicting properties of 3D printed lattices. Importantly, this artificial intelligence strategy goes beyond 'inspection', since it accurately estimates product performance metrics, not just the existence of defects.","ANOMALY DETECTION,DESIGN,CLASSIFICATION,METROLOGY",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Materials Science",,12.363,"ANOMALY,DETECTION,DESIGN,CLASSIFICATION,METROLOGY",ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1639094,

Commercial thermomechanical models are often used to understand how these defects form. However, no clear mitigation strategy has evolved from previous research. Identification of the hierarchy of variables that influence residual stresses will help to uncover practical means of mitigating this difficulty. Here we use multiple machine learning algorithms and a mechanistic model to rank separately both easy to measure process parameters as well as thermomechanical variables that affect the evolution of stresses. We analyze 243 sets of residual stress data for three alloys using random forest and neural network algorithms to uncover the relative influences of the variables. Both these algorithms predict residual stresses with 97 % accuracy. More important, both algorithms provide the same hierarchical influence of process variables on stresses. The substrate preheat temperature is the most influential variable among the process variables. Among the thermomechanical variables, the following variables are the most influential in decreasing order of importance: the gap between the solidus and preheat temperatures, the product of elastic modulus and the coefficient of thermal expansion, molten pool volume, substrate rigidity, and heat input.","Wire-arc additive manufacturing,Residual stresses,Machine learning,Neural network,Random forest,Delamination",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Materials Science",,12.363,"DISTORTION,PREDICTION,TOOL",ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING,,

Empirically capturing this relationship often requires the utilization of intelligent algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to derive a predictive model that fits into an experimental dataset. However, its black-box nature prevents researchers from mathematically describing its contents. This paper attempts to address this ambiguity by employing two deep machine learning techniques - Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) and Neural Interpretation Diagram (NID) - to identify the critical material constituents that affect the ANN. 110 UHPC compressive strength tests varying based on the material quantities were compiled into a database to train the ANN. As a result, four material constituents were selected; mainly, cement, fly ash, silica fume and water. These material constituents were then employed into the ANN to compute more accurate predictions (r(2) = 80.1% and NMSE = 0.012) than the model with all eight material constituents (r(2) = 21.5% and NMSE = 0.035). Finally, a nonlinear regression model based on the four selected material constituents was developed and a parametric study was conducted. It was concluded that the utilization of ANN with SFS and NID drastically improved the accuracy of the model, and provided valuable insights on the ANN compressive strength predictions for different UHPC mixes.

While human's are great at determining the emotional state of people while they communicate in person, it is challenging and still largely an unsolved problem to computationally determine the emotional state of a person.
Methods: Emotional states of a person manifest in the physiological biosignals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) because these signals are impacted by the peripheral nervous system of the body, and the peripheral nervous system is strongly coupled with the mental state of the person. In this paper, we present a method to accurately recognize six emotions using ECG and EDA signals and applying autoregressive hidden Markov models (AR-HMMs) and heart rate variability analysis on these signals. The six emotions include happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust.
Results: We evaluated our method on a comprehensive new dataset collected from 30 participants. Our results show that our proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 88.6% in distinguishing across the 6 emotions.
Conclusions: The key technical depth of the paper is in the use of the AR-HMMs to model the EDA signal and the use of LDA to enable accurate emotion recognition without requiring a large number of training samples. Unlike other studies, we have taken a hierarchical approach to classify emotions, where we first categorize the emotion as either positive or negative and then identify the exact emotion.

The clinical features of the patient, PET quantitative parameters, and textural indices from pretreatment PET-CT images are selected for the study. The main objective of the study is to use classifiers to predict the outcome for HNSCC patients and compare the performance of the model with the conventional statistical model (CoxPH).
Methods: We have applied a 40% fixed SUV threshold method for tumour delineation. Clinical features of each patient are provided in the dataset, and other features are calculated using LIFEx software. For predicting the outcome, we have implemented three classifiers - Random Forest classifier, Gradient Boosted Decision tree (GBDT) and Decision tree classifier. We have trained each model using 93 data points and test the model performance using 39 data points. The best model - GBDT is chosen based on the performance metrics.
Results: It is observed that typically three features: MTV (Metabolic tumour Volume), primary tumour site and GLCM_correlation are significant for prediction of survival outcome. For testing cohort, GBDT achieves a balanced accuracy of 88%, where conventional statistical model reported a balanced accuracy of 81.5%.

The Spanish healthcare network established population-based screening programs in all Autonomous Communities, where mammograms of asymptomatic women are taken with early diagnosis purposes. Breast density assessed from digital mammograms is a biomarker known to be related to a higher risk to develop breast cancer.
It is thus crucial to provide a reliable method to measure breast density from mammograms. Furthermore the complete automation of this segmentation process is becoming fundamental as the amount of mammograms increases every day. Important challenges are related with the differences in images from different devices and the lack of an objective gold standard.
This paper presents a fully automated framework based on deep learning to estimate the breast density. The framework covers breast detection, pectoral muscle exclusion, and fibroglandular tissue segmentation.
Methods: A multi-center study, composed of 1785 women whose ""for presentation"" mammograms were segmented by two experienced radiologists. A total of 4992 of the 6680 mammograms were used as training corpus and the remaining (1688) formed the test corpus. This paper presents a histogram normalization step that smoothed the difference between acquisition, a regression architecture that learned segmentation parameters as intrinsic image features and a loss function based on the DICE score.
Results: The results obtained indicate that the level of concordance (DICE score) reached by the two radiologists (0.77) was also achieved by the automated framework when it was compared to the closest breast segmentation from the radiologists. For the acquired with the highest quality device, the DICE score per acquisition device reached 0.84, while the concordance between radiologists was 0.76.
Conclusions: An automatic breast density estimator based on deep learning exhibits similar performance when compared with two experienced radiologists. It suggests that this system could be used to support radiologists to ease its work. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The most prominent cases are found in aerospace engineering, where intricate structures are produced by forging and subsequent machining or by machining from solid blocks of material. Due to the large scrap rate involved in conventional manufacturing, ribweb structures are suitable applications for additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Among the AM processes, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is highly suitable for rib-web structures due to its high deposition rate and the potential to manufacture large-size parts. In WAAM, the welding strategy greatly influences the properties and quality of deposited parts. With an increasing number of starts and stops, the danger of uneven material build-up and welding defects increases. Unfortunately, most rib-web structures do not represent Eulerian paths, i.e. they cannot be manufactured with a continuous welding motion, in which every edge is visited only once. This study presents a novel strategy for generating optimal tool paths for WAAM of lightweight rib-web structures, mitigating the disadvantages of discontinuous welding paths such as welding defects and uneven build-up. It is shown that doubling the number of welding passes on each edge of the rib-web structure turns non-Eulerian paths into Eulerian paths, which can be welded continuously. When two or more weld beads are deposited on each edge, the vertices of the rib-web structure may suffer from underfilling. It is shown that this can be avoided by a correction strategy, which consists in manufacturing the part once, evaluating the size of voids in the junctions, and computing a correction to deposit the required amount of material into the center of the junction. While this strategy may be used if a single part is considered, it is shown that the tool path correction to be applied to arbitrary junction geometries can be represented by a neural network that is derived from an experimental database consisting of representative junction types. With this approach, paths for any rib-web geometry can be generated, which saves lead time in variant-rich production. The paths proposed in this work avoid non-welding moves and may hence outperform even single weld-bed strategies in terms of welding efficiency.","Additive manufacturing,WAAM,Lightweight structures,Adaptive void filling,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Materials Science",,12.363,"DEPOSITION,OPTIMIZATION",ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING,,

Four important properties, which are the existence of gamma' and other phases, the gamma' solvus temperature and area fraction are predicted based on machine learning-based models.

Intuitively, symmetries from observed trajectories define transformations that leave the space of feasible RL trajectories invariant and can be used to generate new feasible trajectories, which could be used for training. Based on this data augmentation idea, we formulate a general framework, called Invariant Transform Experience Replay that we present with two techniques: (i) Kaleidoscope Experience Replay exploits reflectional symmetries and (ii) Goal-augmented Experience Replay which takes advantage of lax goal definitions. In the Fetch tasks from OpenAI Gym, our experimental results show significant increases in learning rates and success rates.

The purpose of this study was to add to evidence of the long-term prognostic value of coronary cis angiography (CCTA) when combined with nonimaging risk factors and to investigate how CCTA can contribute to the decision to start statin therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients underwent CCM in an outpatient setting for a variety of indications. The National Death Index from February 2004 through December 2018 was queried to identify the outcomes of death due to any cause (all-cause mortality) and death due to coronary artery disease. Framingham and machine learning risk estimation models were constructed. Machine learning inputs were generated from radiologists' descriptions of the findings on structured report forms and not directly from the image pixels. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards were calculated. Clinical benefit was assessed on the basis of the potential impact on assignment of statin therapy.
RESULTS. A total of 6892 outpatients were studied, 4452 (64.6%) of whom were men (mean [+/- SD] age, 51.2 +/- 11.1 years) and 2440 (35.4%) of whom were women (mean age, 573 +/- 12.2 years). The median follow-up was 11.9 years. Among the 6892 patients, 569 deaths (8.3%) were attributed to all-cause mortality, and 94 deaths (1.4%) were due to coronary artery disease. Survival showed strong dependence on the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. For all-cause mortality, the AUC was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86) for the machine learning risk estimation model versus 0.79 (95% CI, 0.78-0.81) for the Framingham risk estimation model (p < 0.001), and for death due to coronary artery disease, the AUC was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) for the machine learning model versus 0.82 (95% CI, 0.77-0.86) for the Framingham model (p = 0.004). Using machine learning risk estimates, the prescription of statins could more accurately be matched to the burden of coronary disease than when Framingham risk estimates were used.
CONCLUSION. Compared with the Framingham model, the machine learning model improved risk estimation. Similar models might be useful to better target prescription of statins and reduce their overuse.","cardiovascular risk,coronary atherosclerosis,coronary CT angiography,machine learning,statin",Article,"AMER ROENTGEN RAY SOC, 44211 SLATESTONE CT, LEESBURG, VA USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,ANGIOGRAPHY,ARTERY-DISEASE,CARDIOVASCULAR,RISK,CLINICAL-OUTCOMES,CURVE,PREDICTION,GUIDELINE,REGISTRY,STATIN,EXTENT",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,,
33,Soft Tissue Sarcoma: Preoperative MRI-Based Radiomics and Machine Learning May Be Accurate Predictors of Histopathologic Grade,215,4,963-969,"Xu Wenjian,Hao Dapeng,Hou Feng,Zhang Dejing,Wang Hexiang","Xu WJ,Hao DP,Hou F,Zhang DJ,Wang HX",Wang HX,10.2214/AJR.19.22147,Qingdao University,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of radiomics features for differentiating soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) of different histopathologic grades.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. The T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted MR images of 70 STSs of varying grades (35 low-grade [grades 1 and 2], 35 high-grade [grade 3]) formed the primary dataset used to train multiple machine learning algorithms for the construction of models for assigning STS grade. The models were tested with a separate validation dataset.
RESULTS. Different machine learning algorithms had different strengths and weaknesses. The best classification algorithm for the prediction of STS grade had a combination of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator feature selection method and the random forest classification algorithm (AUC, 0.9216; 95% CI, 0.8437-0.9995) in the validation set. The accuracy of the combined methods applied to the validation set was 91.43%; sensitivity, 88.24% and specificity, 9444%.
CONCLUSION. Because of tumor heterogeneity, initial biopsy grade may be an underestimate of the final grade identified in extensive histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens. This creates an urgent need to construct an accurate preoperative approach to grading STS. This radiomics study revealed the optimal machine learning approaches for differentiating STS grades. This capability can enhance the precision of preoperative diagnosis.","diagnosis,machine learning,MRI,soft tissue sarcoma",Article,"AMER ROENTGEN RAY SOC, 44211 SLATESTONE CT, LEESBURG, VA USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.073,"NEOADJUVANT,CHEMOTHERAPY,NEEDLE-BIOPSY,DIAGNOSIS,IMAGES,RADIOGENOMICS,HETEROGENEITY,PHASE-3,TUMORS",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY,,

Six urban morphology variables (e.g. BDG, PAVE, WALL, HBDG, SVF, GnPR) were extracted from geographical information system (GIS) maps, three dimensional (3D) model and field surveys. This study compares the predictive power between ordinary least squares linear regression (LR) and machine learning (e.g. random forest (RF)). By using RF as a regression model, the air temperature has a greater RMSE reduction than LR, ranging from 10 % to 33 %. The relationship between outdoor air temperature and urban morphology variables based on non-parametric regression is presented. On average, lower SVF space can reduce the heat on campus. As the WALL increases, the temperature rises, but the changes in day and night are different. Greenery reduces daytime temperature due to the shading of solar radiation, although the shading from trees blocks the release of long-wave radiation from artificial materials at night. The observation indicates nighttime temperature can be reduced by planting low height greenery while keeping SVF unchanged.","Outdoor air temperature,Sky view factor,Green plot ratio,Machine learning,Geographical information system",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Construction & Building Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Energy & Fuels",,7.308,"SKY,VIEW,FACTOR,HEAT-ISLAND,SIMULATION,DESIGN,ENVIRONMENTS,HIGHRISE,CANYONS,STREET,IMPACT,FLUXES",SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,,

The localization of the target vertebral level (i.e. the position of a vertebra in a spine) is typically done by back palpation or under X-ray guidance, yielding either higher chances of procedure failure or exposure to ionizing radiation. Preliminary studies have been conducted in the literature, suggesting that ultrasound imaging may be a precise and safe alternative to X-ray for spine level detection. However, ultrasound data are noisy and complicated to interpret. In this study, a robotic-ultrasound approach for automatic vertebral level detection is introduced. The method relies on the fusion of ultrasound and force data, thus providing both ""tactile"" and visual feedback during the procedure, which results in higher performances in presence of data corruption. A robotic arm automatically scans the volunteer's back along the spine by using force-ultrasound data to locate vertebral levels. The occurrences of vertebral levels are visible on the force trace as peaks, which are enhanced by properly controlling the force applied by the robot on the patient back. Ultrasound data are processed with a Deep Learning method to extract a 1D signal modelling the probabilities of having a vertebra at each location along the spine. Processed force and ultrasound data are fused using both a non deep learning method and a Temporal Convolutional Network to compute the locations of the vertebral levels. The benefits of fusing force and image signals for the identification of vertebrae locations are showcased through extensive evaluation.","Medical robots and systems,computer vision for medical robotics",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Robotics,,3.856,IDENTIFICATION,IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11404,

In current practice, the rolling sequence (i.e., the sequence of stands and the geometry of their rolls) needed to achieve a given final cross-section is designed by experts based on previous experience, and iteratively refined in a costly trial-and-error process. Finite Element Method simulations are increasingly adopted to make this process more efficient and to test potential rolling sequences, achieving good accuracy at the cost of long simulation times, limiting the practical use of the approach. We propose a supervised learning approach to predict the deformation of a given workpiece by a set of rolls with a given geometry; the model is trained on a large dataset of procedurally-generated FEM simulations, which we publish as supplementary material.

However, security issues such as sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized operations have not received sufficient concerns. There are still some defects with the existing solutions to encrypted EEG data such as low accuracy, high time complexity or slow processing speed. For this reason, a classification and recognition method of encrypted EEG data based on neural network is proposed, which adopts Paillier encryption algorithm to encrypt EEG data and meanwhile resolves the problem of floating point operations. In addition, it improves traditional feed-forward neural network (FNN) by using the approximate function instead of activation function and realizes multi-classification of encrypted EEG data. Extensive experiments are conducted to explore the effect of several metrics (such as the hidden neuron size and the learning rate updated by improved simulated annealing algorithm) on the recognition results. Followed by security and time cost analysis, the proposed model and approach are validated and evaluated on public EEG datasets provided by PhysioNet, BCI Competition IV and EPILEPSIAE.

In this work, we devise a system based on autoencoders for classification of regular, apnea and unconstrained breathing patterns (i.e. multiclass). Methods: Our approach is based on morphological analysis of the respiratory signals, using an autoencoder trained on regular breathing. The correlation between the input and output of the autoencoder is used to train and test several classifiers in order to select the best. Our approach is evaluated in a novel real-world respiratory gating biofeedback training dataset and on the Apnea-ECG reference dataset. Results: Accuracies of 95 +/- 3.5% and 87 +/- 6.6% were obtained for two different datasets, in the classification of breathing and apnea. These results suggest the viability of a generalised model to characterise the breathing patterns under study. Conclusions: Using autoencoders to learn respiratory gating training patterns allows a data-driven approach to feature extraction, by focusing only on the signal's morphology.

Computer-aided diagnosis tools for skin lesions are typically trained using pre-selected single-lesion images, taken under controlled conditions, which limits their use in wide-field scenes. Here, we propose a computer-aided classifier system with such input conditions to aid in the rapid identification of suspicious pigmented lesions at the primary care level.
Methods: 133 patients with a multitude of skin lesions were recruited for this study. All lesions were examined by a board-certified dermatologist and classified into ""suspicious"" and ""non-suspicious"". A new clinical database was acquired and created by taking Wide-Field images of all major body parts with a consumer-grade camera under natural illumination condition and with a consistent source of image variability. 3-8 images were acquired per patient on different sites of the body, and a total of 1759 pig-mented lesions were extracted. A machine learning classifier was optimized and build into a computer aided classification system to binary classify each lesion using a suspiciousness score.
Results: In a testing set, our computer-aided classification system achieved a sensitivity of 100% for sus-picious pigmented lesions that were later confirmed by dermoscopy examination (""SPL_A"") and 83.2% for suspicious pigmented lesions that were not confirmed after examination (""SPL_B""). Sensitivity for non -suspicious lesions was 72.1%, and accuracy was 75.9%. With these results we defined a suspiciousness score that is aligned with common macro-screening (naked eye) practices.
Conclusions: This work demonstrates that wide-field photography combined with computer-aided classi-fication systems can distinguish suspicious from non-suspicious pigmented lesions, and might be effec-tive to assess the severity of a suspicious pigmented lesions. We believe this approach could be useful to support skin screenings at a population-level. (C) 2020 The Authors.

In this paper, a bilateral image analysis method based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is developed for mass detection in mammograms.
Methods: The proposed bilateral mass detection method consists of two networks: a registration network for registering bilateral mammograms and a Siamese-Faster-RCNN network for mass detection using a pair of registered mammograms. In the first step, self-supervised learning network is built to learn the spatial transformation between bilateral mammograms. This network can directly estimate spatial transformation by maximizing an image-wise similarity metric and corresponding points labeling is not needed. In the second step, an end-to-end network combining the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a Siamese Fully Connected (Siamese-FC) network is designed. Different from existing methods, the designed network integrates mass detection on single image with registered bilateral images comparison.
Results: The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets (publicly available dataset INbreast and private dataset BCPKUPH and TXMD). For INbreast dataset, the proposed method achieves 0.88 true positive rate (TPR) with 1.12 false positives per image (FPs/I). For BCPKUPH dataset, the proposed method achieves 0.85 TPR with 1.86 FPs/I. For TXMD dataset, the proposed method achieves 0.85 TPR with 2.70 FPs/I.
Conclusions: Registration experimental result shows that the proposed method is suitable for bilateral mass detection. Mass detection experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than unilateral mass detection method, different bilateral connection schemes and image level fusion bilateral schemes.

Despite that much progress has been made for heart sound classification in recent years, most of them are based on conventional segmented features and shallow structure based classifiers. These conventional acoustic representation and classification methods may be insufficient in characterizing heart sound, and generally suffer from a degraded performance due to the complicated and changeable cardiac acoustic environment. In this paper, we propose a new heart sound classification method based on improved Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) features and convolutional recurrent neural networks. The Mel-frequency cepstrums are firstly calculated without dividing the heart sound signal. A new improved feature extraction scheme based on MFCC is proposed to elaborate the dynamic characteristics among consecutive heart sound signals. Finally, the MFCC-based features are fed to a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network (CRNN) for feature learning and later classification task. The proposed deep learning framework can take advantage of the encoded local characteristics extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long-term dependencies captured by the recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive studies on the performance of different network parameters and different network connection strategies are presented in this paper. Performance comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are given for discussions.

One of the top deadliest diseases in the world is leukemia. Once detected, its treatment is immediately required. Standard morphologic diagnosis of leukemia by hematologists is done by examining the patient's peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) under microscope. However, manual recognition is prone to variations such as experience and tiredness where the percentage of error in diagnosis is between 30%-40%. Therefore, it is necessary to have a robust automated system for leukemia detection that is not influenced by human variations. Machine learning is attracting interest in the biomedical field as it improves sensitivity and specificity of the disease diagnosis, influencing the objectivity of the decision-making process. Objectives Testing deep learning technique that use microscopic images to identify leukemia based on a pretrained deep convolutional neural network which is an approach of machine learning algorithms. Material and method Dataset used was collected from Clinical Pathology lab, Assiut University Hospital, Egypt, containing binary balanced dataset: leukemic and normal blood, each sample composed of PB and BM smears images. We analyzed 412 digital images; 206 images of leukemia (AML types only) & 206 images of normal blood. 1-Training & testing phase: testing different types of pre-trained convolutional neural networks models ex. Alexnet, VGG16, GoogleNet, ResNet101, and Inception-v3. We divided images into two groups; 80% of images assigned as ""training-set"", each of the models trained on the images to extract features to differentiate leukemic and normal images, remaining 20% images were assigned as ""testing-set"" or so called ""never seen"" by the models. 2-Evaluation of sensitivity/specificity/accuracy: evaluating ability of the models to detect target; based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of detection. 3. We computed the testing execution time per image in dataset. Results Comparing the ability of models to differentiate leukemia vs normal images showed that Inception-v3 model had the highest accuracy (99%) in detection and classification of AML. In terms of sensitivity and specificity, the Inception-v3 can detect all leukemic cases of AML, with 100% sensitivity; and specificity of 97.8%. Inception-v3 required only 0.2273 seconds to test each image in AML-IDB. Conclusion Inception-v3 outperforms other pretrained convolutional neural networks in diagnosis of leukemia, this model of Machine learning algorithm can be used in the context of lab diagnosis acting as a second opinion after manual evaluation of leukemia. </p>","convolutional neural network,deep learning,leukemia,microscopic blood image,morphologic diagnosis,sensitivity,specificity",Article,"WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS, WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, Maharashtra, INDIA",Hematology,,,"BLOOD,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION",EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY,,

It is, therefore, vital that the structural integrity of such components is known, during their lifecycle, with the highest possible accuracy via precise modelling, reliable inspections and, more recently but still at research level, effective condition monitoring.
With a focus on solid freight axles, the research investigates the applicability of Acoustic Emission as a structural health monitoring approach for determining the in-service condition of a full-scale axle.

However, the application of quantitative MRI is severely limited by the long data acquisition time required by repetitive image acquisition and measurement of field map. Inspired by recent development of artificial intelligence, we propose a deep learning strategy to accelerate the acquisition of quantitative MRI, where every quantitative T-1 map is derived from two highly undersampled variable-contrast images with radiofrequency field inhomogeneity automatically compensated. In a multi-step framework, variable-contrast images are first jointly reconstructed from incoherently undersampled images using convolutional neural networks; then T-1 map and B-1 map are predicted from reconstructed images employing deep learning. Thus, the acceleration includes undersampling in every input image, a reduction in the number of variable contrast images, as well as a waiver of B-1 map measurement. The strategy is validated in T-1 mapping of cartilage. Acquired with a consistent imaging protocol, 1224 image sets from 51 subjects are used for the training of the prediction models, and 288 image sets from 12 subjects are used for testing. High degree of acceleration is achieved with image fidelity well maintained. The proposed method can be broadly applied to quantify other tissue properties (e.g. T-2, T-1p) as well.","NEURAL-NETWORK,RECONSTRUCTION,BRAIN,T-1,ACCURATE,TRANSMIT,TIME,T1",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"NEURAL-NETWORK,RECONSTRUCTION,BRAIN,T-1,ACCURATE,TRANSMIT,TIME,T1",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,,

LRI constituted the cornerstone of several breakthroughs in texture analysis, including Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Maximum Response 8 (MR8) and steerable filterbanks. Whereas globally rotation invariant Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were recently proposed, LRI was very little investigated in the context of deep learning. LRI designs allow learning filters accounting for all orientations, which enables a drastic reduction of trainable parameters and training data when compared to standard 3D CNNs. In this paper, we propose and compare several methods to obtain LRI CNNs with directional sensitivity. Two methods use orientation channels (responses to rotated kernels), either by explicitly rotating the kernels or using steer able filters. These orientation channels constitute a locally rotation equivariant representation of the data. Local pooling across orientations yields LRI image analysis. Steerable filters are used to achieve a fine and efficient sampling of 3D rotations as well as a reduction of trainable parameters and operations, thanks to a parametric representations involving solid Spherical Harmonics (SH),which are products of SH with associated learned radial profiles. Finally, we investigate a third strategy to obtain LRI based on rotational invariants calculated from responses to a learned set of solid SHs. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared to standard CNNs on 3D datasets including synthetic textured volumes composed of rotated patterns, and pulmonary nodule classification in CT. The results show the importance of LRI image analysis while resulting in a drastic reduction of trainable parameters, outperforming standard 3D CNNs trained with rotational data augmentation.

Solving this problem can be challenging if, during optimization, the automated method cannot access information about the location of the lesions nor is given single examples of the lesions. We propose a new weakly supervised detection method using neural networks, that computes attention maps revealing the locations of brain lesions. These attention maps are computed using the last feature maps of a segmentation network optimized only with global image-level labels. The proposed method can generate attention maps at full input resolution without need for interpolation during preprocessing, which allows small lesions to appear in attention maps. For comparison, we modify state-of-the-art methods to compute attention maps for weakly supervised object detection, by using a global regression objective instead of the more conventional classification objective. This regression objective optimizes the number of occurrences of the target object in an image, e.g. the number of brain lesions in a scan, or the number of digits in an image. We study the behavior of the proposed method in MNIST-based detection datasets, and evaluate it for the challenging detection of enlarged perivascular spaces - a type of brain lesion - in a dataset of 2202 3D scans with point-wise annotations in the center of all lesions in four brain regions. In MNIST-based datasets, the proposed method outperforms the other methods. In the brain dataset, the weakly supervised detection methods come close to the human intrarater agreement in each region. The proposed method reaches the best area under the curve in two out of four regions, and has the lowest number of false positive detections in all regions, while its average sensitivity over all regions is similar to that of the other best methods. The proposed method can facilitate epidemiological and clinical studies of enlarged perivascular spaces and help advance research in the etiology of enlarged perivascular spaces and in their relationship with cerebrovascular diseases.

However, a quantification of the reliability of automated image analysis is essential, in particular in medicine when physicians rely on the results for making critical treatment decisions. In this work, we provide an entire framework to diagnose ischemic stroke patients incorporating Bayesian uncertainty into the analysis procedure. We present a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) yielding a probability for a stroke lesion on 2D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with corresponding uncertainty information about the reliability of the prediction. For patient-level diagnoses, different aggregation methods are proposed and evaluated, which combine the individual image-level predictions. Those methods take advantage of the uncertainty in the image predictions and report model uncertainty at the patient-level. In a cohort of 511 patients, our Bayesian CNN achieved an accuracy of 95.33% at the image-level representing a significant improvement of 2% over a non-Bayesian counterpart. The best patient aggregation method yielded 95.89% of accuracy. Integrating uncertainty information about image predictions in aggregation models resulted in higher uncertainty measures to false patient classifications, which enabled to filter critical patient diagnoses that are supposed to be closer examined by a medical doctor. We therefore recommend using Bayesian approaches not only for improved image level prediction and uncertainty estimation but also for the detection of uncertain aggregations at the patient-level.

There is a growing interest in obtaining such datasets for medical image analysis applications. However, the impact of label noise has not received sufficient attention. Recent studies have shown that label noise can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models in many machine learning and computer vision applications. This is especially concerning for medical applications, where datasets are typically small, labeling requires domain expertise and suffers from high interand intra-observer variability, and erroneous predictions may influence decisions that directly impact human health. In this paper, we first review the state-of-theart in handling label noise in deep learning. Then, we review studies that have dealt with label noise in deep learning for medical image analysis. Our review shows that recent progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by the medical image analysis community. To help achieve a better understanding of the extent of the problem and its potential remedies, we conducted experiments with three medical imaging datasets with different types of label noise, where we investigated several existing strategies and developed new methods to combat the negative effect of label noise. Based on the results of these experiments and our review of the literature, we have made recommendations on methods that can be used to alleviate the effects of different types of label noise on deep models trained for medical image analysis. We hope that this article helps the medical image analysis researchers and developers in choosing and devising new techniques that effectively handle label noise in deep learning.

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and the artifacts in ultrasound images make it difficult to track targets accurately and robustly. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning model, called a Cascaded One-shot Deformable Convolutional Neural Network (COSD-CNN), to track landmarks in real time in long ultrasound sequences. Specifically, we design a cascaded Siamese network structure to improve the tracking performance of CNN-based methods. We propose a one-shot deformable convolution module to enhance the robustness of the COSD-CNN to appearance variation in a meta-learning manner. Moreover, we design a simple and efficient unsupervised strategy to facilitate the network's training with a limited number of medical images, in which many corner points are selected from raw ultrasound images to learn network features with high generalizability. The proposed COSD-CNN has been extensively evaluated on the public Challenge on Liver UltraSound Tracking (CLUST) 2D dataset and on our own ultrasound image dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FSYSU). Experiment results show that the proposed model can track a target through an ultrasound sequence with high accuracy and robustness.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 50 0 0 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 20 0 0 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 30 0 0 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( +/- 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

However, the manual analysis of bone scintigraphy images requires extensive experience and is exhausting and time-consuming. An automated diagnosis system for such images is therefore much desired. Although automatic or semi-automatic methods for the diagnosis of bone scintigraphy images have been widely studied, they employ various steps to classify the images, including segmentation of the entire skeleton, detection of hot spots, and feature extraction, which are complex and inadequately validated on small datasets, thereby resulting in low accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we describe the development of a deep convolutional neural network to determine the absence or presence of bone metastasis. This model consisting of three sub-networks that aim to extract, aggregate, and classify high-level features in a data-driven manner. There are two main innovations behind this method; First, the diagnosis is performed by jointly analyzing both anterior and posterior views, which leads to high accuracy. Second, a spatial attention feature aggregation operator is proposed to enhance the spatial location information. A large annotated bone scintigraphy image dataset containing 15,474 examinations from 13,811 patients was constructed to train and evaluate the model. The proposed method is compared with three human experts. The high classification accuracy achieved demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for the diagnosis of bone scintigraphy images, and that it can be applied as a clinical decision support tool.

Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables (e.g., stages and subtypes) as in cancer diagnosis, several prognosis prediction models basing on patients' survival information have been adopted to estimate the clinical outcome of cancer patients. However, most existing studies treat the diagnosis and prognosis tasks separately. In fact, the diagnosis information (e.g., TNM Stages) indicates the extent of the disease severity that is highly correlated with the patients' survival. While the diagnosis is largely made based on histopathological images, recent studies have also demonstrated that integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data can hold great promise for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. However, direct combination of these two types of data may bring redundant features that will negatively affect the prediction performance. Therefore, it is necessary to select informative features from the derived multi-modal data. Based on the above considerations, we propose a multi-task multi-modal feature selection method for joint diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. Specifically, we make use of the task relationship learning framework to automatically discover the relationships between the diagnosis and prognosis tasks, through which we can identify important image and genomics features for both tasks. In addition, we add a regularization term to ensure that the correlation within the multi-modal data can be captured. We evaluate our method on three cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, and the experimental results verify that our method can achieve better performance on both diagnosis and prognosis tasks than the related methods.

To minimize the potential risk, one way is to reduce the injected tracer. However, this will lead to poor image quality with conventional image reconstruction and processing. In this paper, we proposed a supervised deep learning model, CycleWGANs, to boost low-dose PET image quality. Validations were performed on a low dose dataset simulated from a real dataset with biopsy-proven primary lung cancer or suspicious radiological abnormalities. Low dose PET images were reconstructed on reduced PET raw data by randomly discarding events in the PET list mode data towards the count level of 1 million. Traditional image denoising methods (Non-Local Mean (NLM) and block-matching 3D(BM3D)) and two recently-published deep learning methods (RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN) were included for comparisons. At the count level of 1 million (true counts), the proposed model can accurately estimate full-dose PET image from low-dose input image, which is superior to the other four methods in terms of the mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax) bias for lesions and normal tissues. The bias of SUV (SUVmean, SUVmax) for lesions and normal tissues are (-2. 06 +/- 3 . 50% , -0. 84 +/- 6 . 94% ) and (-0. 45 +/- 5 . 59% , N/A) in the estimated PET images, respectively. However, the RED-CNN achieved the best score in traditional metrics, such as structure similarity (SSIM), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). Correlation and profile analyses have successfully explained this phenomenon and further suggested that our method could effectively preserve edge and also SUV values than RED-CNN, 3D-cGAN and NLM with a slightly higher noise.

They employ two-class supervised classifiers that work with feature sets containing representative variables taken from station inventory books that indicate the presence of leaks. Fuel leaks in petrol stations with underground tanks pose a serious problem from an environmental standpoint. Large leaks are very evident, and are therefore detected quickly without the need to use a specific procedure. Small leaks, however, tend to go unnoticed, and if no detection techniques are employed, they are only identified once environmental damage has been done. This makes detecting the leak in the shortest time possible as important as ascertaining when the leak started. The authors show how the use of time windows, which entails having the classifier work with information accumulated over several days, can be used to efficiently resolve the proposed problem, fully complying with the applicable regulation.","Machine learning,Two-class classifiers,Time windows,Fuel leaks,Inventory reconciliation",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Operations Research & Management Science",,5.252,STORAGE,SAFETY SCIENCE,,

The mechanisms underlying this asymmetric transfer have been investigated by psychophysical, neurophysiological, brain imaging, and computational modeling studies. One study (PNAS 113 (2016) 5724-5729) reported that rTMS stimulations of dorsal and ventral areas impair motion direction discrimination of moving dot stimuli at 40% coherent (""noisy"") and 100% coherent (zero-noise) levels, respectively. However, after direction training at 100% coherence, only rTMS stimulation of the ventral cortex is effective, disturbing direction discrimination at both coherence levels. These results were interpreted as learning-induced changes of functional specializations of visual areas. We have concerns with the behavioral data of this study. First, contrary to the report of highly location-specific motion direction learning, our replicating experiment showed substantial learning transfer (e.g., transfer/learning ratio = 81.9%. vs 14.8% at 100% coherence). Second and more importantly, we found complete transfer of direction learning from 40% to 100% coherence, a critical baseline that is missing in this study. The transfer effect suggests that similar brain mechanisms underlie motion direction processing at two coherence levels. Therefore, this study's conclusions regarding the roles of dorsal and ventral areas in motion direction processing at two coherence levels, as well as the effects of perceptual learning, are not supported by proper experimental evidence. It remains unexplained why distinct impacts of dorsal and ventral rTMS stimulations on motion direction discrimination were observed.","Perceptual learning,Motion direction,External noise,Location Specificity",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Neurosciences & Neurology,Ophthalmology,Psychology",,2.823,"ORIENTATION,IMPROVEMENT,MECHANISMS,TRANSFERS,NOISE",VISION RESEARCH,,

The method exploits subspace-structured features of each solution by projecting it onto a Grassmann manifold. This point-wise linear dimensionality reduction harnesses the structural information to assess the similarity between solutions at different points in the input parameter space. The method utilizes a solution clustering approach in order to identify regions of the parameter space over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be interpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order solutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold using the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the Karcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are projected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean using the exponential mapping. For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression model is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced solution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space. Using this Gaussian process model, the full-field solution can be efficiently predicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the solution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such cases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based spatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the Euclidean space. The proposed method is applied to two numerical examples. The first is a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation with uncertain initial conditions where the surrogate is used to predict the time history solution. The second involves modeling of plastic deformation in a model amorphous solid using the Shear Transformation Zone theory of plasticity, where the proposed surrogate is used to predict the full strain field of a material specimen under large shear strains.

Almost all production processes are multistage in nature, and so most digital twins involve multiple physical phenomena, process steps and different solvers for the simulations. Good interoperability between model solvers and processes are key to achieving a functional digital twin. Passing information between steps can be challenging, complex and time consuming, especially for material data, because the constitutive model interacts with the full modeling environment: material behavior is interdependent with the history of the process, the solver subroutines and the boundary conditions. This work proposes a flexible yet robust standardization approach, called FlexMM, for dealing with material data, constitutive models, measurement data or mathematical models to overcome part of the abovementioned complexity. The implementation of FlexMM consists of a general rule structure in which constitutive behavior is described, as well as its interaction with the subroutines used by the finite element solver. The definition of the constitutive model is stored in a separate file, in which the material behavior can be described in a user selected format, such as look-up tables, standard statistical models, machine learning or analytical expressions. After a calculation step, the new local material properties are mapped to a file to facilitate the next history-dependent step. In this way, the interaction between the different fabrication steps and processes can be incorporated. A material/process case study is presented to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of FlexMM.","FEM analysis,Digital twin,Multi stage modeling,User subroutines,Zero-defect manufacturing,Industry 4.0",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,7.187,"DIGITAL,TWIN,FLOW-STRESS,TIME-STEP,ELEMENT,MESHES,DISCRETE",ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advengsoft.2020.102876,

However, predicting the resultant crystal structure(s) ""in silico"" remains a major challenge. Previous studies have primarily used density functional theory to obtain correlated parameters and fit them to existing data, but this is impractical given the extensive regions of unexplored composition space and considerable computational cost. A rapidly developing area of materials science is the application of machine learning to accelerate materials discovery and reduce computational and experimental costs. Machine learning has inherent advantages over traditional modeling, owing to its flexibility as new data becomes available and its rapid ability to construct relationships between input data and target outputs. In this article, we propose a novel high-throughput approach, called ""ML-HEA"", for coupling thermodynamic and chemical features with a random forest machine learning model for predicting the solid solution forming ability. The model can be a primary tool or integrated into existing alloy discovery workflows. The ML-HEA method is validated by comparing the results with reliable experimental data for binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary systems. Comparison to other modeling approaches, including CALPHAD and the LTVC model, are also made to assess the performance of the machine learning model on labeled and unlabeled data. The uncertainty of the model in predicting the resultant phase of each composition is explored via the output of individual predictor trees. Importantly, the developed model can be immediately applied to explore material space in an unconstrained manner, and is readily updated to reflect the results of new experiments.

As a first step toward realizing the human-centered approach to artificial intelligence and expert systems, this paper lays the foundation for a data analytic approach to managing fatigue in physically-demanding workplaces. The proposed framework capitalizes on continuously collected human performance data from wearable sensor technologies, and is centered around four distinct phases of fatigue: (a) detection, where machine learning methodologies are deployed to detect the occurrence of fatigue; (b) identification, where key features relating to the fatigue occurrence is to be identified; (c) diagnosis, where the fatigue mode is identified based on the knowledge generated in the previous two phases; and (d) recovery, where a suitable intervention is applied to return the worker to mitigate the detrimental effects of fatigue on the worker. Moreover, the framework establishes criteria for feature and machine learning algorithm selection for fatigue management. Two specific application cases of the framework, for two types of manufacturing-related tasks, are presented. Based on the proposed framework and a large number of test sets used in the two case studies, we have shown that: (i) only one wearable sensor is needed for fatigue detection with an average accuracy of >= 0.850 and a random forest model comprised of < 7 features; and (ii) the selected features are task-dependent, and thus capturing different modes of fatigue. Therefore, this research presents an important foundation for future expert systems that attempt to quantify/predict changes in workers' performance as an input to prescriptive rest-break scheduling, job-rotation, and task assignment models. To encourage future work in this important area, we provide links to our data and code as Supplementary materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The multilevel thresholding method is more efficient for segmenting digital mammograms compared to the classic bi-level thresholding since it uses a higher number of intensities to represent different regions in the image. In the literature, there are different techniques for multilevel segmentation; however, most of these approaches do not obtain good segmented images. In addition, they are computationally expensive. Recently, statistical criteria such as Otsu, Kapur, and cross-entropy have been utilized in combination with evolutionary and swarm-based strategies to investigate the optimal threshold values for multilevel segmentation. In this paper, an efficient methodology for multilevel segmentation is proposed using the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm and the minimum cross-entropy as a fitness function. To substantiate the results and effectiveness of the HHO-based method, it has been tested over a benchmark set of reference images, with the Berkeley segmentation database, and with medical images of digital mammography. The proposed HHO-based solver is verified based on other comparable optimizers and two machine learning algorithms K-means and the Fuzzy IterAg. The comparisons were performed based on three groups. This first one is to provide evidence of the optimization capabilities of the HHO using the Wilcoxon test, and the second is to verify segmented image quality using the PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM metrics. Then, the third way is to verify the segmented image comparing it with the ground-truth through the metrics PRI, GCE, and VoI. The experimental results, which are validated by statistical analysis, show that the introduced method produces efficient and reliable results in terms of quality, consistency, and accuracy in comparison with the other methods. This HHO-based method presents an improvement over other segmentation approaches that are currently used in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying uncertain variables in these phenomena is key for developing cost-effective design formulae and efficient reliability analysis. This task however is challenging due to the scarcity of data and the large set of uncertain factors that contribute to the impact phenomenon. The present study performs a robust global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Sobol's indices on the response of a concrete panel impacted by a Schedule 40 pipe. A high-fidelity, nonlinear Finite Element (FE) model is developed using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation in LS-DYNA. The developed model was validated with the experiments conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Due to the high computational demand of the SPH model, a machine learning-based surrogate model called Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is applied to emulate the computational model. This surrogate model that is trained with a limited number of generated SPH simulations is capable of accurately predicting the behavior of concrete panels subjected to projectile impact over the space of predictors. The predictors here include uncertain variables associated with concrete and steel material properties. GSA is subsequently performed by integrating the constructed surrogate model into Sobol's algorithm. Results indicate that concrete tensile strength plays a significant role in panel damage, while concrete mass density and compressive strength and mass density of the steel pipe are also significant. These findings suggest that the development of new empirical design formulae and experimental studies on the impact of concrete panels should include the identified significant variables.","Wind-borne projectile,Reinforced concrete panels,Finite element modeling,Bayesian additive regression trees,Global sensitivity analysis",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mechanics",,4.768,"RELIABILITY,STRENGTH,DESIGN,ENERGY,MODELS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING,,

Firstly, 791 Ge-vacancy containing GeTe structures are studied and a large data set of the formation energy of the Ge-vacancy is obtained, which is helpful to understand the vacancy-induced issue of the amorphous GeTe including the resistance drift, etc. By using the ANN fitting based on the large energy data set, a bonding picture that is applicable to both the crystalline and the amorphous state of GeTe is predicted. In terms of the contribution to the formation energy of the vacancy, the weight ratio of the bond with length of 3.0-3.6 angstrom and 3.6-4.5 angstrom can be approximated as 6:1.

Multi-physics models that capture the deposition process at the smallest manufacturing scale are solved to accurately simulate local material accumulation. A surrogate model for the multiphysics simulation is used to practically simulate the material accumulation by locally varying the spatial distribution of material along the tool path. This generates a training set representing a variational class of as-manufactured shapes. Machine specific manufacturing uncertainty is then represented as a 3D kernel obtained by deconvolving the simulated as-printed shape with the tool path. This kernel provides a good estimate of the probability of local material accumulation independent of the chosen part and tool-path. Convolution of the kernel with a tool-path combined with an appropriate super-level-set of the resulting field provides a computationally efficient way to estimate the as-manufactured shape of AM parts. The efficiency results from the highly parallelized implementation of convolution on the GPU. We demonstrate high-resolution shape estimation and visualization of as-printed parts constructed using this approach. We validate the method using data generated by simulating a build process for droplet-based AM, by performing model order reduction of a system of partial differential equations for the 3D Navier-Stokes multiphase flows coupled with heat-transfer and phase change.

Often there are no object models, and especially with cluttered irregularly shaped objects, the robot cannot create a model of the scene due to occlusion. One of our key insights is that based on previous sensory input we are only interested in moving an object out of the disentanglement around obstacles. That is, we only need to know where the robot can successfully move in order to plan the disentangling. Due to the uncertainty we integrate information about blocked movements into a probability map. The map defines the probability of the robot successfully moving to a specific configuration. Using as cost the failure probability of a sequence of movements we can then plan and execute disentangling iteratively. Since our approach circumvents only previously encountered obstacles, new movements will yield information about unknown obstacles that block movement until the robot has learned to circumvent all obstacles and disentangling succeeds. In the experiments, we use a special probabilistic version of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for planning and demonstrate successful disentanglement of objects both in 2-D and 3-D simulation, and, on a KUKA LBR 7-DOF robot.

This work has studied the use of ultrasonic measurements and a range of different machine learning classification methods to monitor the fouling removal of food materials in plastic and metal cylindrical pipes. The experimental results showed that the developed techniques could predict the presence of fouling with prediction confidence as high as 100% for both plastic and metal pipes. The sensor technique performed marginally better in the plastic pipe and similar performance was found for the all of the machine learning methods studied. This work has demonstrated the potential of low-cost ultrasonic sensors to monitor and therefore optimise cleaning processes within pipes. It is discussed how new data set labelling strategies will be required for the techniques to be used effectively within production environments.","Ultrasonic measurements,Machine learning,Clean-in-Place,Sensors,Fouling monitoring,Food and drink manufacturing",Article; Proceedings Paper,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Food Science & Technology,,5.498,"IN-PLACE,PROCESSES,SYSTEM,SPECTROSCOPY,LINE",FOOD CONTROL,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/4348495/Author%20accepted%20manuscript-1.pdf,

In order to achieve this, a reactor was designed and built based on the reaction of BaCl2-NH3. Experimental data from this reactor were collected, where barium chloride was used as a solid absorbent and ammonia as a refrigerant. The neural network was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The correlation coefficient between experimental data and data simulated by the neural network wasr = 0.9957. In the neural network's sensitivity analysis, it was found that the inputs, reactor's heating temperature and sorption time, influence neural network's learning by 35% and 20%, respectively. It was also found that, by applying permutations to experimental data and using multibase mathematical symmetry groups, the neural network training algorithm converges faster.","BARIUM CHLORIDE-AMMONIA,EXPANDED GRAPHITE COMPOUND,PERFORMANCE PREDICTION,MASS-TRANSFER,HEAT,DESIGN",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mathematics",,1.27,"BARIUM,CHLORIDE-AMMONIA,EXPANDED,GRAPHITE,COMPOUND,PERFORMANCE,PREDICTION,MASS-TRANSFER,HEAT,DESIGN",MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/9098709.pdf,

Methods A literature review is conducted on the state-of-the-art techniques, which could be divided into five categories: (1) signal and image processing-based techniques to augment the needle, (2) modifications to the needle and insertion to help with needle-transducer alignment and visibility, (3) changes to ultrasound image formation, (4) motion-based analysis and (5) machine learning. Results Advantages, limitations and challenges of representative examples in each of the categories are discussed. Evaluation techniques performed in ex vivo, phantom and in vivo studies are discussed and summarized. Conclusion Greatest limitation of the majority of the literature is that they rely on original visibility of the needle in the static image. Need for additional/improved apparatus is the greatest limitation toward clinical utility in practice. Significance Ultrasound-guided needle placement is performed in many clinical applications, including biopsies, treatment injections and anesthesia. Despite the wide range and long history of this technique, an ongoing challenge is needle visibility in ultrasound. A robust technique to enhance ultrasonic needle visibility, especially for steeply inserted hand-held needles, and while maintaining clinical utility requirements is needed.","Needle detection,Ultrasound,Image-guidance,Machine learning,Needle visualization,Image processing",Review,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"TIP,LOCALIZATION,CURVILINEAR,ULTRASOUND,COLOR,DOPPLER,BIOPSY,TRACKING,VISIBILITY,GUIDANCE,SYSTEM,SEGMENTATION,STANDARD",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

A focus is on microstructure and temperature dependency of stresses and plastic strains in a structural panel under realistic loading conditions. Structural analysis is conducted using the recently developed uncertainty-quantified parametrically homogenized constitutive model (UQ-PHCM) for near-alpha Titanium alloys like Ti6242S. PHCMs exhibit explicit microstructural dependency and are developed from homogenization of crystal plasticity finite element simulation results with machine learning. Uncertainties due to model reduction, data sparsity and microstructural variability are accounted for in the model. Structural response with the UQ-PHCMs is compared to those predicted by isotropic elasticity and J(2) plasticity models without explicit microstructure information. Parametric studies illustrate how different uncertainties in the UQ-PHCM framework propagate to the structural response variables. The results also show the relative contribution of different microstructural features to the propagated uncertainty in structural response variables.

An important component of BCI, electroencephalography (EEG) is in general sensitive to noise and rich in all kinds of information from our brain. In this paper, we study the feature fusion problem in electroencephalography (EEG). We introduce (1) a discriminative feature extractor which can classify multi-labels from short-term EEG signals, and (2) a new strategy to filter out unwanted features from EEG signals based on our feature extractor. Filtering out signals relating to one property of the EEG signal while retaining another is similar to the way we can listen to just one voice during a party, which is known as the cocktail party problem in the machine learning area. Built based on the success of short-term EEG discriminative model, the feature filter is an end-to-end framework which is trained to map EEG signals with unwanted features directly to EEG signals without those features. Our experimental results on an alcoholism dataset show that our novel model can filter out over 90% of alcoholism information on average from EEG signals, with an average of only 4.2% useful feature accuracy lost, showing effectiveness for our proposed task.

Acquiring MR images is a slow process and acquiring multi scans of the same cross section for multi-echo imaging is even slower. In order to accelerate the scan, compressed sensing (CS) based techniques have been advocating partial K-space (Fourier domain) scans; the resulting images are reconstructed via structured CS algorithms. In recent times, it has been shown that instead of using off-the-shelf CS, better results can be obtained by adaptive reconstruction algorithms based on structured dictionary learning.

First, we identify the molecular crystals with molecular centroid arrangements that correspond to affine transformations of four basic cubic lattices, through topological analysis of the dataset of crystalline polycyclic aromatic molecules. The novelty of our method is that the topological data analysis is applied to arrangements of molecular centroids intead of those of atoms.

Methods The proposed method achieves high-speed T(2)mapping by highly sparsely sampling (k, TE)-space. Image reconstruction from the undersampled data was done by exploiting the low-rank structure and sparsity in the T-2-weighted image sequence and image priors learned from training data. The image priors for a single TE were generated from the public Human Connectome Project data using a tissue-based deep learning method; the image priors were then transferred to other TEs using a generalized series-based method. With these image priors, the proposed reconstruction method used a low-rank model and a sparse model to capture subject-dependent novel features. Results The proposed method was evaluated using experimental data obtained from both healthy subjects and tumor patients using a turbo spin-echo sequence.

Before the conceptualization of data lakes, former big data management platforms in the research fields of computational biology and biomedicine could not deal with many practical data management tasks very well. As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied, and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modeling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multimodal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, and sampling size. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multisided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.","data lake,DIKW,biological resources,unstructured data,XAI,explainability,interpretability",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,INFORMATION,FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552915,

Numerical experiments show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms, many of which are based on the accelerated proximal gradient method.for this article are available online.","Nonsmooth optimization,Penalized regression,Regularization",Article,"AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC, 732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",Mathematics,,3.347,"THEORETICAL,PROPERTIES,LINEARIZATION",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS,,
