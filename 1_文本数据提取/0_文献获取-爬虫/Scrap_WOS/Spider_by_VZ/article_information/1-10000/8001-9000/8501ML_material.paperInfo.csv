Further, with the identified causality, a neural network was provided to predict and directly lead to the original experimental discovery of new tadpole-shaped structures. An entropy-driven nucleation theory was developed to understand both the ligand and temperature dependent experimental data and the causal inference from the machine learning framework.

The aim of this research was to quantify the effects of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes on urban land surface temperature (LST) during a 25-year period (1993-2018) for the semiarid Shiraz City in southern Iran using Landsat data (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) and machine learning algorithms. Five main LU/LC classes, such as orchard, vegetation, bare surface, asphalt cover, and built-up areas, were identified using a support vector machine algorithm. Landsat images were used to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean LST over the entire study domain increased considerably between 1993 and 2018, due to urbanization, decrease of green areas, and increasing industrial areas. Built-up areas increased considerably by 25.8% from 80 to 100.6 km(2)between 1993 and 2018, while vegetation cover decreased dramatically by 69.3%. Mean LST increased from 38.4 to 40.2 degrees C during the 25-year period with a significant increase of 3.9 degrees C between 2013 and 2018.

In order to do that, a Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) neutralization simulator, and an adapted Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to automate the choice of RL hyperparameters were developed. The controller was developed and validated when it stabilized the effluent's pH in a neutral range in different scenarios during the regulatory and servo operations better than a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. The development of autonomous wastewater pH control systems in coated surface treatment units is a significant advancement, as it reduces human intervention and allows the monitoring of variability associated with the electroplating industry.

The lower level is concerned with servo tracking and regulation of the interface level against variances in ore quality by manipulating middlings flow rate. At the higher level, with the objective to optimize bitumen recovery rate, a supervisory interface level setpoint control is implemented. To prevent sanding, tailings density regulation using tailings withdrawal flow rate is proposed. For each case, an asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) based agent is chosen to interact with a high-fidelity PSV model to learn the near optimal control strategy through episodic interactions. Each of the three control loops is sequentially learnt. In the interface level control loop, a behavioral cloning based two-phase learning scheme to promote stable state space exploration is proposed.

These techniques were commonly used to collect, process, and interpret data from microplastic samples. This review outlined and critiques current approaches for analysis steps in image processing (color, thresholding, particle quantification), spectral processing (background and baseline subtraction, smoothing and noise reduction, data transformation), image classification (reference libraries, morphology, color, and fluorescence intensity), and spectral classification (reference libraries, matching procedures, and best practices for developing in-house reference tools). We highlighted opportunities to advance microplastic data analysis and interpretation by (i) quantifying colors, shapes, sizes, and surface topologies with image analysis software, (ii) identifying threshold values of particle characteristics in images that distinguish plastic particles from other particles, (iii) advancing spectral processing and classification routines, (iv) creating and sharing robust spectral libraries, (v) conducting double blind and negative controls, (vi) sharing raw data and analysis code, and (vii) leveraging readily available data to develop machine learning classification models. We identified analytical needs that we could fill and developed supplementary information for a reference library of plastic images and spectra, a tutorial for basic image analysis, and a code to download images from peer reviewed literature. Our major findings were that research on microplastics was progressing toward the use of multiple analytical methods and increasingly incorporating chemical classification. We suggest that new and repurposed methods need to be developed for high throughput screening using a diversity of approaches and highlight machine learning as one potential avenue toward this capability.","Microplastic,gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,GC-MS,fluorescence,microscopy,high throughput,automation,Fourier transform infrared,FT-IR,plastic,image analysis,machine learning,artificial intelligence,plastic pollution",Review,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Instruments & Instrumentation,Spectroscopy",,2.296,"MARINE-ENVIRONMENT,RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY,BACKGROUND,SUBTRACTION,SIZED,MICROPLASTICS,PLASTIC,PARTICLES,TEXTILE,FIBERS,SURFACE,WATERS,DEMERSAL,FISH,GREAT-LAKES,PYR-GC%2FMS",APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY,https://zenodo.org/record/5242722/files/Applied%20Spectroscopy%202020%2074%20989%20Cowger.pdf,

First-principles approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) provide the best possible accuracy on electronic properties but they are limited to systems up to a few hundreds, or at most thousands of atoms. On the other hand, classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and the finite element method (FEM) are extensively employed to study larger and more realistic systems, but conversely depend on empirical information. Here, we show that machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained over shortab initiomolecular dynamics trajectories enable first-principles multiscale modeling, in which DFT simulations can be hierarchically bridged to efficiently simulate macroscopic structures. As a case study, we analyze the lattice thermal conductivity of coplanar graphene/borophene heterostructures, recently synthesized experimentally (Sci. Adv., 2019,5, eaax6444), for which no viable classical modeling alternative is presently available. Our MLIP-based approach can efficiently predict the lattice thermal conductivity of graphene and borophene pristine phases, the thermal conductance of complex graphene/borophene interfaces and subsequently enable the study of effective thermal transport along the heterostructures at continuum level.

Methods The robustness to motion artifacts and retrospective motion correction capabilities of the PROPELLER (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction) trajectory were combined with prospective motion correction. The prospective correction was done using an intelligent marker attached to the subject. This marker wirelessly synchronizes to the pulse sequence to measure the directionality and magnitude of the magnetic fields present in the MRI machine during a short navigator, thus enabling it to determine its position and orientation in the scanner coordinate frame. Three approaches to incorporating the marker-navigator into the PROPELLER sequence were evaluated. The specific absorption rate, and subsequent scan time, of the T-1-weighted FLAIR PROPELLER sequence, was reduced using a variable refocusing flip-angle scheme. Evaluations of motion correction performance were done with 4 volunteers and 3 types of head motion. Results During minimal out-of-plane movement, retrospective PROPELLER correction performed similarly to the prospective correction. However, the prospective clearly outperformed the retrospective correction when there was out-of-plane motion. Finally, the combination of retrospective and prospective correction produced the sharpest images even during large continuous motion. Conclusion Prospective motion correction of a PROPELLER sequence makes it possible to handle continuous, large, and high-speed head motions with only minor reductions in image quality.","brain,motion correction,magnetic resonance imaging,PROPELLER,T-1-FLAIR,wireless radiofrequency triggered acquisition device",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"ATTENUATED,INVERSION-RECOVERY,SPIN-ECHO,SEQUENCES,SMOOTH,TRANSITIONS,T1-WEIGHTED,FLAIR,STEADY-STATES,BLADE,BRAIN,MRI,CALIBRATION,PARALLEL",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mrm.28477,

The proposed work consists of four modules namely, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and segmentation. Initially, the noise present in the input image is removed using the Median Filter because the noises present in the input images will affect the accuracy of the classification process. At once, the images are converted into 3 x 3 blocks. Then, the texture features are extracted from the pre-processed image. After the feature extraction process, the features are given to the adaptive k-nearest neighbor classifier to classify an image as normal or abnormal. Later, the tumor regions are segmented with the help of the optimal possibilistic fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. Both classification and the segmentation appearance technique are evaluated in terms of accuracy; sensitivity as well as specificity.

Recently, researchers have developed a new method for the instinctive analysis of AD based on machine learning and its subfield, deep learning. Recent state-of-the-art techniques consider multimodal diagnosis, which has been shown to achieve high accuracy compared to a unimodal prognosis. Furthermore, many studies have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain volumes and the volume of subregions, as well as to search for diffuse changes in white/gray matter in the brain. In this study, T1-weighted structural MRI was used for the early classification of AD. MRI results in high-intensity visible features, making preprocessing and segmentation easy. To use this image modality, we acquired four types of datasets from each dataset's server. In this work, we downloaded 326 subjects from the National Research Center for Dementia homepage, 123 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage, 121 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders homepage, and 131 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center homepage. In our experiment, we used the multiatlas label propagation with expectation-maximization-based refinement segmentation method. We segmented the images into 138 anatomical morphometry images (in which 40 features belonged to subcortical volumes and the remaining 98 features belonged to cortical thickness). The entire dataset was split into a 70 : 30 (training and testing) ratio before classifying the data. A principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction. Then, the support vector machine radial basis function classifier was used for classification between two groups-AD versus health control (HC) and early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI) versus late MCI (LMCI). The proposed method performed very well for all four types of dataset. For instance, for the AD versus HC group, the classifier achieved an area under curve (AUC) of more than 89% for each dataset. For the EMCI versus LMCI group, the classifier achieved an AUC of more than 80% for every dataset. Moreover, we also calculated Cohen kappa and Jaccard index statistical values for all datasets to evaluate the classification reliability.

Damage to any structural component of a bridge will negatively affect its safety, integrity, and longevity. Bridge decks are more susceptible to severe deterioration because they are exposed to harsh conditions including heavy traffic, varying temperatures, road salts, and abrasive forces. The ability to forecast the conditions of bridges in an accurate way has been a great challenge to transportation agencies. Many previous research studies highlighted the need to have a data-driven approach in predicting and evaluating the deterioration conditions of bridges. As such, this paper develops a computational data-driven asset management system to evaluate and predict bridge deck deterioration conditions. A multistep interdependent research methodology was utilized. First, the best set of variables affecting the conditions of bridge decks was identified. Second, two computational machine learning models were developed for the prediction of deck conditions using artificial neural networks (ANNs) andk-nearest neighbors (KNNs). Third, a comparison between the developed models is conducted to select the ultimate model with the highest accuracy. The result is a framework that is able to evaluate and predict deck conditions with a prediction accuracy of 91.44%. While this research is applied to bridges in Missouri, the technique can be used on any similarly available data set nationwide. This study adds to the body of knowledge by devising a computational data-driven framework that is valuable for transportation agencies as it allows them to evaluate and predict deck conditions with high accuracy.

20,Machine learning-based models for the concrete breakout capacity prediction of single anchors in shear,147,,,"Olalusi Oladimeji B.,Spyridis Panagiotis","Olalusi OB,Spyridis P",Olalusi OB,10.1016/j.advengsoft.2020.102832,University of Kwazulu Natal,"Proper functioning and safety of anchor elements are decisive for the overall performance of a structural system. A possible failure mode for anchor loaded in shear is the concrete breakout failure. Concrete related failure mode poses a significant safety issue, since they may develop abruptly/brittle, without preceding signs of damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of the concrete breakout strength of anchors in shear is crucial. This study proposes two machine learning models - a Gaussian process regression (GPR) and a support vector machine (SVM) model - for predicting the concrete breakout capacity of single anchors in shear. To this end, experimental strength of 366 tests on single anchors with concrete edge breakout failures were collected from literature to establish the experimental database to train and test the models. 70% of the data were used for the model training, and the rest were used for the model testing. Shear influence factors such as the concrete strength, the anchor diameter, the embedment depth (technically the influence length), and the concrete edge distance were taken as the model input variables. The generated GPR and SVM prediction models yielded a determination coefficient R-2= 0.99 for both the training and testing data sets. Predictions from the developed models were compared to that of the other existing models (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and Grosser) to validate their performance. The developed GPR and SVM models provided a better prediction of the experimentally observed shear strength, compared to the existing models. The predictions obtained from the GPR model are the most accurate, yielding a value of 5.6 mean absolute error when tested.","Machine learning,Artificial intelligence,Support vector machine,Gaussian process regression,Concrete breakout,Anchor,Fasteners,Shear Strength",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,7.187,"ADHESIVE,ANCHORS,NEURAL-NETWORKS,LARGE,DIAMETERS,HEADED,ANCHORS,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,CONE",ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE,,

Four GTB models are then proposed to predict the ultimate load-carrying capacity and displacement of the structure for safety evaluation of strength and serviceability. Both continuous and discrete input variables are considered. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, four popular ML methods including support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and deep learning (DL) are refereed in a comparison study. Three numerical examples of steel truss structures including a planar truss, a spatial truss, and a case study of planar truss bridge are considered in the comparative study.

Emerging matrix classifiers have been successfully applied to motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, but they belong to shallow classifiers, making powerful stacked generalization principle not exploited for automatically learning deep EEG features. To learn the high-level representation and abstraction, we proposed a novel deep stacked support matrix machine (DSSMM) to improve the performance of existing shallow matrix classifiers in EEG classification.
Methods: The main idea of our framework is founded on the stacked generalization principle, where support matrix machine (SMM) is introduced as the basic building block of deep stacked network. The weak predictions of all previous layers obtained via SMM are randomly projected to help move apart the manifold of the original input EEG feature, and then the newly generated features are fed into the next layer of DSSMM. The framework only involves an efficient feed-forward rather than parameter fine-tuning with backpropagation, each layer of which is a convex optimization problem, thus simplifying the objective function solving process.
Results: Extensive experiments on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected EEG dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our DSSMM outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods.
Conclusion: The proposed DSSMM inherits the characteristic of matrix classifiers that can learn the structural information of data as well as the powerful capability of deep representation learning, which makes it adapted to classify complex matrix-form EEG data.

It is, however, challenging to gather sufficient and representative data. Experiments are possible only in small numbers due to specialty materials, manufacturing, infrastructure, and testing involved. Simulation and numerical models need skills and appropriate validation. If the dataset at hand is too small in size to train ML, professionals tend to create synthetic data, which may not necessarily meet the quality required of the new data. A Knowledge-based Data Boosting (KDB) process, named COMPOSITES, that rationally addresses data sparsity without losing data quality is systematically discussed in this paper. A study on inter-ply fracture toughness of carbon nanotube (CNT)-engineered carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates is used to demonstrate the KDB process. This involved strengthening of inter-ply interfaces using CNT advocated for improving delamination resistance of the CFRP composites. It is demonstrated that the KDB process helped augment the dataset reliably and improved the best fit regression lines. The process also made it possible to define boundaries and limitations of the augmented dataset. Such sanitized dataset is certainly valuable for prognostic modeling.

The impact of such systems in clinical practice and in the society can be high, considering that they can contribute to the reduction of medical errors and the associated adverse events. Today, most of these systems are based on binary classification algorithms that are ""strongly"" supervised, in the sense that the abnormal training images need to be annotated in detail, i.e., with pixel-level annotations indicating the location of the abnormalities. However, this approach usually does not take into account the diversity of the image content, which may include a variety of structures and artifacts. In the context of gastrointestinal video-endoscopy, addressed in this study, the semantics of the normal contents of the endoscopic video frames include normal mucosal tissues, bubbles, debris and the hole of the lumen, whereas the abnormal video frames may include additional semantics corresponding to lesions or blood. This observation motivated us to investigate various multi-label classification methods, aiming to a richer semantic interpretation of the endoscopic images. Among them, an image-saliency enabled bag-of-words approach and a convolutional neural network architecture enabling multi-scale feature extraction (MM-CNN) are presented. Weakly-supervised learning is implemented using only semantic-level annotations, i.e., meaningful keywords, thus, avoiding the need for the resource demanding pixelwise annotation of the training images. Experiments were performed on a diverse set of wireless capsule endoscopy images. The results of the experiments validate that the weakly-supervised multi-label classification can provide enhanced discrimination of the gastrointestinal abnormalities, with MM-CNN method to provide the best performance.","Endoscopy,Video analysis,Lesion detection,Weakly supervised learning,Multi-label classification,Bag-of-words,Convolutional neural networks",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Computer Science,,1.827,"BOWEL,CAPSULE,ENDOSCOPY,PERFORMANCE",EVOLVING SYSTEMS,,

Automatic diagnosis of retinal images for early detection of glaucoma, stroke, and blindness is emerging in intelligent health care system. The method primarily depends on various abnormal signs, such as area of hard exudates, area of blood vessels, bifurcation points, texture, and entropies. The development of an automated screening system based on vessel width, tortuosity, and vessel branching are also used for grading. However, the automated method that directly can come to a decision by taking the fundus images got less attention.

Finally, the process of audiovisual cross-modal retrieval is realized by the system. The experimental results show that the proposed system has a good application effect on wood.

This paper proposes a novel method for heart disease diagnosis. Here, the pre-processing of medical data is done using log-transformation that converts the data to its uniform value range. Then, the feature selection process is performed using sparse fuzzy-c-means (FCM) for selecting significant features to classify medical data. Incorporating sparse FCM for the feature selection process provides more benefits for interpreting the models, as this sparse technique provides important features for detection, and can be utilized for handling high dimensional data. Then, the selected features are given to the deep belief network (DBN), which is trained using the proposed Taylor-based bird swarm algorithm (Taylor-BSA) for detection.

To counter this, biometric authentication has been proposed: the use of distinctive physiological and behavioral characteristics as a form of identification and access control. One of the recent developments is electroencephalography (EEG)-based authentication. It builds on the subject-specific nature of brain responses which are difficult to recreate artificially. We propose an authentication system based on EEG signals recorded in response to a simple motor paradigm. Authentication is achieved with a novel two-stage decoder. In the first stage, EEG signal features are extracted using an inception- and a VGG-like deep learning neural network (NN) both of which we compare with principal component analysis (PCA). In the second stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for binary classification to authenticate the subject based on the extracted features.

Fully automated segmentation of the prostate is a crucial step of CAD for prostate cancer, but visual inspection is still required to detect poorly segmented cases. The aim of this work was therefore to establish a fully automated quality control (QC) system for prostate segmentation based on T2-weighted MRI. Four different deep learning-based segmentation methods were used to segment the prostate for 585 patients. First order, shape and textural radiomics features were extracted from the segmented prostate masks. A reference quality score (QS) was calculated for each automated segmentation in comparison to a manual segmentation. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was trained and optimized on a randomly assigned training dataset (N = 1756, 439 cases from each segmentation method) to build a generalizable linear regression model based on the radiomics features that best estimated the reference QS. Subsequently, the model was used to estimate the QSs for an independent testing dataset (N = 584, 146 cases from each segmentation method). The mean +/- standard deviation absolute error between the estimated and reference QSs was 5.47 +/- 6.33 on a scale from 0 to 100. In addition, we found a strong correlation between the estimated and reference QSs (rho = 0.70).

Although widespread, its causes and progression modalities are complex and still not fully understood. Through neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion Magnetic Resonance (MR), more sophisticated and specific studies of the disease can be performed, offering a valuable tool for both its diagnosis and early detection. However, processing large quantities of medical images is not an easy task, and researchers have turned their attention towards machine learning, a set of computer algorithms that automatically adapt their output towards the intended goal. In this paper, a systematic review of recent machine learning applications on diffusion tensor imaging studies of Alzheimer's disease is presented, highlighting the fundamental aspects of each work and reporting their performance score. A few examined studies also include mild cognitive impairment in the classification problem, while others combine diffusion data with other sources, like structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (multimodal analysis). The findings of the retrieved works suggest a promising role for machine learning in evaluating effective classification features, like fractional anisotropy, and in possibly performing on different image modalities with higher accuracy.","Alzheimer's disease,mild cognitive impairment,diffusion tensor imaging,magnetic resonance imaging,machine learning,support vector machine",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,2.824,"MILD,COGNITIVE,IMPAIRMENT,STRUCTURAL,MRI,CONNECTIVITY,DIAGNOSIS,AMYGDALA,HIPPOCAMPUS,PREDICTION,CONVERSION,DEMENTIA,FEATURES",PROCESSES,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/9/1071/pdf,

Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic method for gas plume detection and segmentation by analyzing the characteristics of gas plumes in MWC images. This method is based on the AdaBoost cascade classifier, combining the Haar-like feature and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) feature. After obtaining the detected result from the above algorithm, a target localization algorithm, based on a histogram similarity calculation, is given to exactly localize the detected target boxes, by considering the differences in gas plume and background noise in the backscatter strength. On this basis, a real-time segmentation method is put forward to get the size of the detected gas plumes, by integration of the image intersection and subtraction operation. Through the shallow-water and deep-water experiment verification, the detection accuracy of this method reaches 95.8%, the precision reaches 99.35% and the recall rate reaches 82.7%. Integrated with principles and experiments, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed and discussed, and finally some conclusions are drawn.","multibeam water column (MWC) image,gas plume,automatic detection,background noise,image segmentation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Geology,Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,5.353,BACKSCATTER,REMOTE SENSING,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/18/3085/pdf,

The availability of low-cost camera hardware on the market today and recent advances in Machine Learning enable a wide range of clinical and health-related applications, such as patient monitoring or exercise recognition at home. In this study, we evaluated the motion tracking performance of the latest generation of the Microsoft Kinect camera, Azure Kinect, compared to its predecessor Kinect v2 in terms of treadmill walking using a gold standard Vicon multi-camera motion capturing system and the 39 marker Plug-in Gait model. Five young and healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at three different velocities while data were recorded simultaneously with all three camera systems. An easy-to-administer camera calibration method developed here was used to spatially align the 3D skeleton data from both Kinect cameras and the Vicon system. With this calibration, the spatial agreement of joint positions between the two Kinect cameras and the reference system was evaluated. In addition, we compared the accuracy of certain spatio-temporal gait parameters, i.e., step length, step time, step width, and stride time calculated from the Kinect data, with the gold standard system. Our results showed that the improved hardware and the motion tracking algorithm of the Azure Kinect camera led to a significantly higher accuracy of the spatial gait parameters than the predecessor Kinect v2, while no significant differences were found between the temporal parameters.

Thus, the performance of generic classification models that classify stress status is crude. Building a person-specific model leads to a reliable classification, but it requires the collection of new data to train a new model for every individual and needs periodic upgrades because stress is dynamic. In this paper, a new binary classification (called stressed and non-stressed) approach is proposed for a subject's stress state in which the inter-beat intervals extracted from a photoplethysomogram (PPG) were transferred to spatial images and then to frequency domain images according to the number of consecutive. Then, the convolution neural network (CNN) was used to train and validate the classification accuracy of the person's stress state. Three types of classification models were built: person-specific models, generic classification models, and calibrated-generic classification models. The average classification accuracies achieved by person-specific models using spatial images and frequency domain images were 99.9%, 100%, and 99.8%, and 99.68%, 98.97%, and 96.4% for the training, validation, and test, respectively.

In such a scenario, the wearability of the system is a significant factor affecting user comfort.

In this study, cognitive workload-related hemodynamic changes were acquired using an fNIRS system covering the whole forehead, which is the region of interest in most cognitive workload-monitoring studies. A machine learning approach was applied to explore how the mean accuracy of the cognitive workload classification accuracy varied across various sensing locations on the forehead such as the Left, Mid, Right, Left-Mid, Right-Mid and Whole forehead. The statistical significance analysis result showed that the Mid location could result in significant cognitive workload classification accuracy compared to Whole forehead sensing, with a statistically insignificant difference in the mean accuracy.

Several studies have utilized state of the art deep learning methods and combined physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram (EEG), electroencephalogram (ECG), skin temperature, along with facial expressions, voice, posture to name a few, in order to classify emotions. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent the third generation of neural networks and employ biologically plausible models of neurons. SNNs have been shown to handle Spatio-temporal data, which is essentially the nature of the data encountered in emotion recognition problem, in an efficient manner. In this work, for the first time, we propose the application of SNNs in order to solve the emotion recognition problem with the multimodal dataset. Specifically, we use the NeuCube framework, which employs an evolving SNN architecture to classify emotional valence and evaluate the performance of our approach on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset. The multimodal data used in our work consists of facial expressions along with physiological signals such as ECG, skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration signal, mouth length, and pupil size. We perform classification under the Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation mode. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 73.15% for classifying binary valence when applying feature-level fusion, which is comparable to other deep learning methods. We achieve this accuracy even without using EEG, which other deep learning methods have relied on to achieve this level of accuracy. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SNN can be successfully used for solving the emotion recognition problem with multimodal data and also provide directions for future research utilizing SNN for Affective computing. In addition to the good accuracy, the SNN recognition system is requires incrementally trainable on new data in an adaptive way. It only one pass training, which makes it suitable for practical and on-line applications.

Following FE simulation, eight geometrical features in each of 120 cross sections in the pre-stenting artery model, as well as the corresponding post-stenting lumen area, were extracted for training and testing the ML models.

Results showed that the SVR models provided better predictions than the linear regression model in terms of bias.

We propose an end-to-end trainable convolutional-deconvolutional deep neural network architecture that enables learning mapping from a single aerial imagery to a DSM for analysis of urban scenes. We perform multisensor fusion of aerial optical and aerial light detection and ranging (Lidar) data to prepare the training data for our pipeline. The dataset quality is key to successful estimation performance. Typically, a substantial amount of misregistration artifacts are present due to georeferencing/projection errors, sensor calibration inaccuracies, and scene changes between acquisitions. To overcome these issues, we propose a registration procedure to improve Lidar and optical data alignment that relies on Mutual Information, followed by Hough transform-based validation step to adjust misregistered image patches. We validate our building height estimation model on a high-resolution dataset captured over central Dublin, Ireland: Lidar point cloud of 2015 and optical aerial images from 2017. These data allow us to validate the proposed registration procedure and perform 3D model reconstruction from single-view aerial imagery.

In this work, we evaluate emotion in terms of low/high arousal and valence classification through Supervised Learning (SL), Decision Fusion (DF) and Feature Fusion (FF) techniques using multimodal physiological data, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Respiration (RESP), or Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). The main contribution of our work is a systematic study across five public datasets commonly used in the Emotion Recognition (ER) state-of-the-art, namely: (1) Classification performance analysis of ER benchmarking datasets in the arousal/valence space; (2) Summarising the ranges of the classification accuracy reported across the existing literature; (3) Characterising the results for diverse classifiers, sensor modalities and feature set combinations for ER using accuracy and F1-score; (4) Exploration of an extended feature set for each modality; (5) Systematic analysis of multimodal classification in DF and FF approaches. The experimental results showed that FF is the most competitive technique in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity.

Thus, it is of significance to real-time detect metal ions and control discharge in the metallurgical wastewater. We developed an accurate and rapid approach based on the singular perturbation spectrum estimator and extreme gradient boosting (SPSE-XGBoost) algorithms to simultaneously determine multi-metal ion concentrations by UV-vis spectrometry. In the approach, the spectral data is expanded by multi-order derivative preprocessing, and then, the sensitive feature bands in each spectrum are extracted by feature importance (VI score) ranking. Subsequently, the SPSE-XGBoost model are trained to combine multi-derivative features and to predict ion concentrations. The experimental results indicate that the developed ""Expand-Extract-Combine"" strategy can not only overcome problems of background noise and spectral overlapping but also mine the deeper spectrum information by integrating important features. Moreover, the SPSE-XGBoost strategy utilizes the selected feature subset instead of the full-spectrum for calculation, which effectively improves the computing speed. The comparisons of different data processing methods are conducted. It outcomes that the proposed strategy outperforms other routine methods and can profoundly determine the concentrations of zinc, copper, cobalt, and nickel with the lowest RMSEP. Therefore, our developed approach can be implemented as a promising mean for real-time and on-line determination of multi-metal ion concentrations in zinc hydrometallurgy.","zinc hydrometallurgy,metal ion measurement,UV-vis spectroscopy,feature selection and combination,singular perturbation spectrum estimator,extreme gradient boosting",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"PARTIAL,LEAST-SQUARES,QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS,VARIABLE,SELECTION,DERIVATIVE,SPECTRA,HEAVY-METALS,SPECTROSCOPY,COMBINATION,PERFORMANCE,CALIBRATION,SYSTEM",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/17/4936/pdf,

In olive trees, it causes olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS), which is currently a serious threat to the survival of hundreds of thousands of olive trees in the south of Italy and in other countries in the European Union. Controls and countermeasures are in place to limit the further spreading of the bacterium, but it is a tough war to fight mainly due to the invasiveness of the actions that can be taken against it. The most effective weapons against the spread ofXfinfection in olive trees are the detection of its presence as early as possible and attacks to the development of its vector insects. In this paper, image processing of high-resolution visible and multispectral images acquired by a purposely equipped multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed for fast detection ofXfsymptoms in olive trees. Acquired images were processed using a new segmentation algorithm to recognize trees which were subsequently classified using linear discriminant analysis. Preliminary experimental results obtained by flying over olive groves in selected sites in the south of Italy are presented, demonstrating a mean Sorensen-Dice similarity coefficient of about 70% for segmentation, and 98% sensitivity and 93% precision for the classification of affected trees. The high similarity coefficient indicated that the segmentation algorithm was successful at isolating the regions of interest containing trees, while the high sensitivity and precision showed that OQDS can be detected with a low relative number of both false positives and false negatives.","xylella fastidiosa,multi-spectral imaging,UAV,unmanned aerial vehicle,image processing,machine learning,precision agriculture",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"SUBSP,PAUCA,LEAF,SCORCH,APULIA,CULTIVARS,PLANT",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7506861,

In this proof-of-concept study, we thus used wearable inertial and electromyographic sensors for offline classification of different load positions (frontal vs. unilateral vs. bilateral side loads) and weights during gait. Ten participants performed 19 different carrying trials each while wearing the sensors, and data from these trials were used to train and evaluate classification algorithms based on supervised machine learning. The algorithms differentiated between frontal and other loads (side/none) with an accuracy of 100%, between frontal vs. unilateral side load vs. bilateral side load with an accuracy of 96.1%, and between different load asymmetry levels with accuracies of 75-79%. While the study is limited by a lack of electromyographic sensors on the arms and a limited number of load positions/weights, it shows that wearable sensors can differentiate between different load positions and weights during gait with high accuracy.

This automatic process has increased the accuracy of the classification at a reduced cost. The advancement in Convolution Neural Network (CNN) structure has outperformed the traditional approaches in biomedical imaging applications. One of the limiting factors of CNN is it uses spatial image features only for classification. The spectral features from the transform domain have equivalent importance in the complex image classification algorithm. This paper proposes a new CNN structure to classify the histopathological cancer images based on integrating the spectral features obtained using a multi-resolution wavelet transform with the spatial features of CNN. In addition, batch normalization process is used after every layer in the convolution network to improve the poor convergence problem of CNN and the deep layers of CNN are trained with spectral-spatial features. The proposed structure is tested on malignant histology images of the breast for both binary and multi-class classification of tissue using the BreaKHis Dataset and the Breast Cancer Classification Challenge 2015 Datasest. Experimental results show that the combination of spectral-spatial features improves classification accuracy of the CNN network and requires less training parameters in comparison with the well known models (i.e., VGG16 and ALEXNET).

We use three active learning algorithms, including least confidence, margin sampling, and entropy, as the selection criteria. Based on this framework, we further introduce an ""image pool"" to make full advantage of images generated by data augmentation. To prove the availability of the proposed framework, we present a case study on agricultural hyperspectral image classification.

The article presents how to transform individual ECG time series into spectral images for which two characteristics are determined, which are instantaneous frequency and spectral entropy. Feature extraction consists of converting the ECG signal into a series of spectral images using short-term Fourier transformation. Then the images were converted using Fourier transform again to two signals, which includes instantaneous frequency and spectral entropy.

A novel sex estimation method from three-dimensional shapes of the skull using machine learning technology is presented. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 skull shapes were obtained from post-mortem computed tomography data. Homologous models of the whole skull, the cranium only, and the mandible only were created and the coordinates of 40,962 vertices of the models were reduced in dimensionality by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression (PLS). Known sexes and the scores of the obtained components were supplied to the support vector machine, and the accuracy rates of sex estimation were obtained by a 10-fold double-looped cross-validation procedure., Lastly, the developed method was applied to six casework skulls with known sexes to validate the power of the estimation. Results and Conclusion: By reducing dimensionality with PLS, remarkably high accuracy rates were obtained in the estimation. The rates reached 100% in all parts examined, while the rates of parts reduced with PCA remained around 90%. Virtual shapes created from very large and small scores of the first and second components of PLS showed the clear sexual dimorphisms that have been proposed by many researchers.

Materials and methods: Dental visual assets were collected and labeled according to type, category, class, and modifiers. These dental visual assets contained radiographs and clinical images of patients' teeth and occlusion from different angles of view. A modified SqueezeNet architecture was implemented using the TensorFlow r1.10 framework. The model was trained using two NVIDIA Volta graphics processing units (GPUs).

Beyond traditional quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, heavy fermions, and multiferroics, the field has significantly expanded to encompass topological quantum matter, two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals heterostructures, Moire materials, Floquet time crystals, as well as materials and devices for quantum computation with Majorana fermions. In this Roadmap collection we aim to capture a snapshot of the most recent developments in the field, and to identify outstanding challenges and emerging opportunities. The format of the Roadmap, whereby experts in each discipline share their viewpoint and articulate their vision for quantum materials, reflects the dynamic and multifaceted nature of this research area, and is meant to encourage exchanges and discussions across traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is our hope that this collective vision will contribute to sparking new fascinating questions and activities at the intersection of materials science, condensed matter physics, device engineering, and quantum information, and to shaping a clearer landscape of quantum materials science as a new frontier of interdisciplinary scientific inquiry. We stress that this article is not meant to be a fully comprehensive review but rather an up-to-date snapshot of different areas of research on quantum materials with a minimal number of references focusing on the latest developments.","quantum materials,materials science,condensed matter,device engineering,topological materials,superconductors,2D materials,quantum technologies",Review,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,,"LIGHT-INDUCED,SUPERCONDUCTIVITY,TOPOLOGICAL,DIRAC,SEMIMETAL,PSEUDOGAP,CRITICAL-POINT,FERMI-SURFACE,ROOM-TEMPERATURE,FLOQUET-BLOCH,ELECTRON-GAS,INSULATOR,ULTRAFAST,STATES",JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02989038/file/2020_Roche_J._Phys._Mater._the%202020%20Quantum%20Materials%20Roadmap.pdf,

Most existing dFC modeling methods extract dynamic interaction information by using the sliding window-based correlation, whose performance is very sensitive to window parameters. Because few studies can convincingly identify the optimal combination of window parameters, sliding window-based correlation may not be the optimal way to capture the temporal variability of brain activity. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive dFC model, aided by a deep spatial-temporal feature fusion method, for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive Ultra-weighted-lasso recursive least squares algorithm to estimate the adaptive dFC, which effectively alleviates the problem of parameter optimization. Then, we extract temporal and spatial features from the adaptive dFC. In order to generate coarser multi-domain representations for subsequent classification, the temporal and spatial features are further mapped into comprehensive fused features with a deep feature fusion method. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of our proposed method is reached to 87.7%, which is at least 5.5% improvement than the state-of-the-art methods. These results elucidate the superiority of the proposed method for MCI classification, indicating its effectiveness in the early identification of brain abnormalities.","Time series analysis,Feature extraction,Diffusion tensor imaging,Adaptive systems,Topology,Diseases,Network topology,Adaptive dynamic functional connectivity,computer aided analysis,deep feature fusion,machine learning,spatial-temporal feature",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"MILD,COGNITIVE,IMPAIRMENT,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,WHITE-MATTER,NETWORK,PERFORMANCE,VALIDATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

However, it is difficult to precisely predict temperature trends when placing concrete because there are many influencing factors and uncontrollable ambient variables in the curing process. To forecast the short-term temperature trends reliably and automatically, this research proposes a temperature measurement and quality prediction (TMQP) system to proactively evaluate the development trajectory of concrete quality and the temperature changes at the center and surface of the cross section of concrete structural members. The TMQP system includes radio-frequency identification (RFID) temperature sensors for recording the temperature data and Big Data analytics (BDA) combined with the machine-learning method of classification and regression tree (CART) for measuring and predicting of temperature development. The results indicate that the system has over 98% reliability on the correlation coefficients between the predicted temperatures and actual temperatures based on 240 h of continuous experiments and 190 h of documented data.

Histomophometric techniques have been used to assess the glandular epithelium in automated detection and classification pipelines; however, they are often rigid in their implementation, and their performance suffers on large datasets where variation in staining, imaging, and preparation is difficult to control. The purpose of this study is to quantify performance of a pixelwise segmentation algorithm that was trained using different combinations of weak and strong stroma, epithelium, and lumen labels in a prostate histology dataset.
Approach: We have combined weakly labeled datasets generated using simple morphometric techniques and high-quality labeled datasets from human observers in prostate biopsy cores to train a convolutional neural network for use in whole mount prostate labeling pipelines. With trained networks, we characterize pixelwise segmentation of stromal, epithelium, and lumen (SEL) regions on both biopsy core and whole-mount H&E-stained tissue.
Results: We provide evidence that by simply training a deep learning algorithm on weakly labeled data generated from rigid morphometric methods, we can improve the robustness of classification over the morphometric methods used to train the classifier.
Conclusions: We show that not only does our approach of combining weak and strong labels for training the CNN improve qualitative SEL labeling within tissue but also the deep learning generated labels are superior for cancer classification in a higher-order algorithm over the morphometrically derived labels it was trained on.

Approach: Clinical imaging and postsurgical tissue from 48 recruited prospective patients were used in our study. Tissue was sliced to match the MRI orientation and whole-mount slides were stained and digitized. Data from 28 patients (n = 33 slides) were sent to five pathologists to be annotated. Slides from the remaining 20 patients (n = 123 slides) were annotated by one of the five pathologists. Interpathologist variability was measured using Krippendorff' s alpha. Pathologist-specific radiopathomic mapping models were trained using a partial least-squares regression using MRI values to predict epithelium density, a known marker for disease severity. An analysis of variance characterized intermodel means difference in epithelium density. A consensus model was created and evaluated using a receiver operator characteristic classifying high grade versus low grade and benign, and was statistically compared to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).
Results: Interobserver variability ranged from low to acceptable agreement (0.31 to 0.69). There was a statistically significant difference in mean predicted epithelium density values (p < 0.001) between the five models. The consensus model outperformed ADC (areas under the curve = 0.80 and 0.71, respectively, p < 0.05).
Conclusion: We demonstrate that radiopathomic maps of epithelium density are sensitive to the pathologist annotating the dataset; however, it is unclear if these differences are clinically significant. The consensus model produced the best maps, matched the performance of the best individual model, and outperformed ADC. (C) The Authors.

Adjunct screening with ultrasound may partially alleviate this issue but also increases false positives, resulting in unnecessary biopsies. Our study investigated the use of Google AutoML Vision (Mountain View, California), a commercially available machine learning service, to both identify and characterize indeterminate breast lesions on ultrasound.
Approach: B-mode images from 253 independent cases of indeterminate breast lesions scheduled for core biopsy were used for model creation and validation. The performances of two sub-models from AutoML Vision, the image classification model and object detection model, were evaluated, while also investigating training strategies to enhance model performances. Pathology from the patient's biopsy was used as a reference standard.
Results: The image classification models trained under different conditions demonstrated areas under the precision-recall curve (AUC) ranging from 0.85 to 0.96 during internal validation. Once deployed, the model with highest internal performance demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) of 73.5% to 100%], specificity of 83.3% (CI = 51.6% to 97.9%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.7% (CI = 62.9% to 95.5%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (CI non-evaluable) in an independent dataset. The object detection model demonstrated lower performance internally during development (AUC = 0.67) and during prediction in the independent dataset [sensitivity = 75% (CI = 42.8 to 94.5), specificity = 80% (CI = 51.9 to 95.7), PPV = 75% (CI = 50.8 to 90.0), and NPV = 80% (CI = 59.3% to 91.7%)], but was able to demonstrate the location of the lesion within the image.

However, the current diagnosis relies mainly on radiologists who spend time extracting features manually, which inevitably reduces the efficiency of diagnosis. Therefore, designing an automatic segmentation method is urgently necessary for the accurate segmentation of breast masses.
Approach: We propose an effective attention mechanism and multiscale pooling conditional generative adversarial network (AM-MSP-cGAN), which accurately achieves mass automatic segmentation in whole mammograms. In AM-MSP-cGAN, U-Net is utilized as a generator network by incorporating attention mechanism (AM) into it, which allows U-Net to pay more attention to the target mass regions without additional cost. As a discriminator network, a convolutional neural network with multiscale pooling module is used to learn more meticulous features from the masses with rough and fuzzy boundaries. The proposed model is trained and tested on two public datasets: CBIS-DDSM and INbreast.
Results: Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the AM-MSP-cGAN can achieve better segmentation results in terms of the dice similarity coefficient (Dice) and Hausdorff distance metrics, achieving top scores of 84.49% and 5.01 on CBIS-DDSM, and 83.92% and 5.81 on INbreast, respectively. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative experiments illustrate that the proposed model is effective and robust for the mass segmentation in whole mammograms.
Conclusions: The proposed deep learning model is suitable for the automatic segmentation of breast masses, which provides technical assistance for subsequent pathological structure analysis.

Even though low-dose CT scans are also highly desired in dental imaging, public-domain databases of dental CT image pairs have not been established yet. In this paper, we propose a dental CT image denoising method based on the transfer learning of a generative adversarial network (GAN) from the public-domain CT images. We trained a generative adversarial network with the Wasserstein loss function (WGAN) using 5,100 high- and low-dose medical CT image pairs of human chest and abdomen. For the generative network of GAN, we used the U-net structure of five stages to exploit its high computational efficiency. After training the proposed network, named U-WGAN, we fine-tuned the network with 3,006 dental CT image pairs of two different human skull phantoms. For the high- and low-dose scans of the phantoms, we set the tube current of the dental CT to 10 mA and 4 mA, respectively, with the tube voltage set to 90 kVp in both scans. We applied the trained network to denoising of low-dose dental CT images of dental phantoms and adult humans. The U-net processed images showed over-smoothing effects even though U-net had a good performance in the quantitative metrics. U-WGAN showed similar denoising performance to WGAN, but it reduced the computation time of WGAN by a factor of 10. The fine-tuning procedure in the transfer learning scheme enhanced the network performance in terms of the quantitative metrics, and it also improved visual appearance of the processed images. Even though the number of fine-tuning images was very limited in this study, we think the transfer learning scheme can be a good option for developing deep learning networks for dental CT image denoising.","image denoising,dental CT,generative adversarial network (GAN),Wasserstein distance,U-net,transfer learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"LOW-DOSE,CT,RECONSTRUCTION,REDUCTION,NOISE",BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,,

Ten additional corneas were imaged with GDOCM and compared with specular microscopy (SM) to determine performance of the combined GDOCM and CNN to achieve automated endothelial counts relative to current procedural standards.
Results: Cells could be imaged over a larger area with GDOCM than SM, and more cells could be delineated via automatic cell segmentation than via manual methods. ECD obtained from automatic cell segmentation of GDOCM images yielded a correlation of 0.94 (p < 0.001) with the manual segmentation on the same images, and correlation of 0.91 (p < 0.001) with the corresponding manually counted SM results.
Conclusions: Automated endothelial cell counting on GDOCM images with large field of view eliminates selection bias and reduces sampling error, which both affect the gold standard of manual counting on SM images.
