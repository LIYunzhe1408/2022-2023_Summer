In this study we investigate the potential benefit of applying a deep learning (DL) approach for suppressing the elevated imaging noise in low-dose SPECT-MPI studies. We adopt a supervised learning approach to train a neural network by using image pairs obtained from full-dose (target) and low-dose (input) acquisitions of the same patients. In the experiments, we made use of acquisitions from 1,052 subjects and demonstrated the approach for two commonly used reconstruction methods in clinical SPECT-MPI: 1) filtered backprojection (FBP), and 2) ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) with corrections for attenuation, scatter and resolution. We evaluated the DL output for the clinical task of perfusion-defect detection at a number of successively reduced dose levels (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 of full dose). The results indicate that the proposed DL approach can achieve substantial noise reduction and lead to improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of low-dose data. In particular, at 1/2 dose, DL yielded an area-under-the-ROC-curve (AUC) of 0.799, which is nearly identical to the AUC = 0.801 obtained by OSEM at full-dose (p-value = 0.73); similar results were also obtained for FBP reconstruction. Moreover, even at 1/8 dose, DL achieved AUC = 0.770 for OSEM, which is above the AUC = 0.755 obtained at full-dose by FBP. These results indicate that, compared to conventional reconstruction filtering, DL denoising can allow for additional dose reduction without sacrificing the diagnostic accuracy in SPECT-MPI.","Noise reduction,Three-dimensional displays,Single photon emission computed tomography,Image reconstruction,Training,SPECT-MPI,dose reduction,deep learning,convolutional neural networks",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"RISK,STRATIFICATION,NEURAL-NETWORK,CT,REDUCTION,TOMOGRAPHY,PROTOCOLS,PET",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,
2,Multi-Task Siamese Network for Retinal Artery/Vein Separation via Deep Convolution Along Vessel,39,9,2904-2919,"Wang Zhiwei,Jiang Xixi,Liu Jingen,Cheng Kwang-Ting,Yang Xin","Wang ZW,Jiang XX,Liu JG,Cheng KT,Yang X",Yang X,10.1109/TMI.2020.2980117,Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Vascular tree disentanglement and vessel type classification are two crucial steps of the graph-based method for retinal artery-vein (A/V) separation. Existing approaches treat them as two independent tasks and mostly rely on ad hoc rules (e.g. change of vessel directions) and hand-crafted features (e.g. color, thickness) to handle them respectively. However, we argue that the two tasks are highly correlated and should be handled jointly since knowing the A/V type can unravel those highly entangled vascular trees, which in turn helps to infer the types of connected vessels that are hard to classify based on only appearance. Therefore, designing features and models isolatedly for the two tasks often leads to a suboptimal solution of A/V separation. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-task siamese network which aims to learn the two tasks jointly and thus yields more robust deep features for accurate A/V separation. Specifically, we first introduce Convolution Along Vessel (CAV) to extract the visual features by convolving a fundus image along vessel segments, and the geometric features by tracking the directions of blood flow in vessels. The siamese network is then trained to learn multiple tasks: i) classifying A/V types of vessel segments using visual features only, and ii) estimating the similarity of every two connected segments by comparing their visual and geometric features in order to disentangle the vasculature into individual vessel trees. Finally, the results of two tasks mutually correct each other to accomplish final A/V separation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy values of 94.7%, 96.9%, and 94.5% on three major databases (DRIVE, INSPIRE, WIDE) respectively, which outperforms recent state-of-the-arts.","Task analysis,Visualization,Image segmentation,Feature extraction,Convolution,Retina,Machine learning,Siamese network,artery-vein separation,deep learning,multi-task learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"VEIN,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,DEMENTIA",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,

The visual evaluation of OA still suffers from subjectivity. Recently, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems based on learning methods showed potential for improving knee OA diagnostic accuracy. However, learning discriminative properties can be a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex data such as X-ray images, typically used for knee OA diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a Discriminative Regularized Auto Encoder (DRAE) that allows to learn both relevant and discriminative properties that improve the classification performance. More specifically, a penalty term, called discriminative loss is combined with the standard Auto-Encoder training criterion. This additional term aims to force the learned representation to contain discriminative information.

Since the theoretical concepts are rather abstract in this subject, and students often find them too technical and difficult to understand, many authors attempt to answer the question on how to improve students' motivation and interest for the complex teaching material of CN. In this work, we follow a rigorous paper collection methodology and extract a large number of previous studies that relate to the stated research questions. Also, we find that there is no review article in the current literature that would provide a clear systematization or a guided study on this topic. Hence, this work provides a literature overview by binding all the previously used methods for teaching CN in one place, and brings contribution by classifying the existing approaches into four basic classes: methods based on using visualization objects such as network simulators, multimedia applications, packet-tracing tools or visual analogies; methods based on using the virtualization techniques; methods precipitating active learning paradigm and methods based on the practical hands-on laboratory exercises. Moreover, the research in this article goes beyond the proposed classification. The classes of methods and tools are compared and contrasted based on the findings from the literature. Methods are evaluated by a detailed cross-comparison based on their advantages, disadvantages and challenges in the perspective of both teachers and students. The review is additionally strengthened by comparing the educational effectiveness of the classified methods. We examine, classify, and contrast the usual approaches used in teaching CN, provide useful insights on how appropriate they are in achieving specific educational goals and determine the future research directions.","Computer networks,literature survey,network simulators,teaching methods",Review,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",Education & Educational Research,,2.173,"EFFECTIVE,TOOL,MENTAL,MODELS,DESIGN,COMMUNICATION,EXPERIENCES,SUPPORT",ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION,,

However, the integration of wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices can aid in monitoring home exercise by analyzing exercise biomechanics. The objective of this study is to evaluate machine learning models for classifying nine different upper extremity exercises, based upon kinematic data captured from an IMU-based device. Fifty participants performed one compound and eight isolation exercises with their right arm. Each exercise was performed ten times for a total of 4500 trials. Joint angles were calculated using IMUs that were placed on the hand, forearm, upper arm, and torso. Various machine learning models were developed with different algorithms and train-test splits. Random forest models with flattened kinematic data as a feature had the greatest accuracy (98.6%). Using triaxial joint range of motion as the feature set resulted in decreased accuracy (91.9%) with faster speeds. Accuracy did not decrease below 90% until training size was decreased to 5% from 50%. Accuracy decreased (88.7%) when splitting data by participant. Upper extremity exercises can be classified accurately using kinematic data from a wearable IMU device. A random forest classification model was developed that quickly and accurately classified exercises. Sampling frequency and lower training splits had a modest effect on performance. When the data were split by subject stratification, larger training sizes were required for acceptable algorithm performance. These findings set the basis for more objective and accurate measurements of home-based exercise using emerging healthcare technologies.","Extremities,Biomedical measurement,Kinematics,Machine learning,Measurement units,Monitoring,Cameras,Biomechanics,classification,inertial measurement units,machine learning,physical therapy",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"RECOGNITION,CLASSIFICATION,ADHERENCE,REHABILITATION,OSTEOARTHRITIS,ACCURACY",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/9186373/09108597.pdf,

Extracting powerful features from raw ECG signals for fine-grained diseases classification is still a challenging problem today due to variable abnormal rhythms and noise distribution. For ECG analysis, the previous research works depend mostly on heartbeat or single scale signal segments, which ignores underlying complementary information of different scales. In this paper, we formulate a novel end-to-end Deep Multi-Scale Fusion convolutional neural network (DMSFNet) architecture for multi-class arrhythmia detection. Our proposed approach can effectively capture abnormal patterns of diseases and suppress noise interference by multi-scale feature extraction and cross-scale information complementarity of ECG signals. The proposed method implements feature extraction for signal segments with different sizes by integrating multiple convolution kernels with different receptive fields. Meanwhile, joint optimization strategy with multiple losses of different scales is designed, which not only learns scale-specific features, but also realizes cumulatively multi-scale complementary feature learning during the learning process. In our work, we demonstrate our DMSFNet on two open datasets (CPSC_2018 and PhysioNet/CinC_2017) and deliver the state-of-art performance on them. Among them, CPSC_2018 is a 12-lead ECG dataset and CinC_2017 is a single-lead dataset. For these two datasets, we achieve the F1 score 82.8% and 84.1% which are higher than previous state-of-art approaches respectively. The results demonstrate that our end-to-end DMSFNet has outstanding performance for feature extraction from a broad range of distinct arrhythmias and elegant generalization ability for effectively handling ECG signals with different leads.","Deep learning,ECG,multi-scale fusion,convolutional neural network",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"ECG,SIGNALS,CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION,MORPHOLOGY",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6221020/9186373/09064540.pdf,

Automated detection of these symptoms could offer clues as to the early onset of the disease, thus improving the expected clinical outcomes of the patients via appropriately targeted interventions. This potential has led many researchers to develop methods that use widely available sensors to measure and quantify the presence of PD symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and braykinesia. However, most of these approaches operate under controlled settings, such as in lab or at home, thus limiting their applicability under free-living conditions. In this work, we present a method for automatically identifying tremorous episodes related to PD, based on IMU signals captured via a smartphone device. We propose a Multiple-Instance Learning approach, wherein a subject is represented as an unordered bag of accelerometer signal segments and a single, expert-provided, tremor annotation. Our method combines deep feature learning with a learnable pooling stage that is able to identify key instances within the subject bag, while still being trainable end-to-end. We validate our algorithm on a newly introduced dataset of 45 subjects, containing accelerometer signals collected entirely in-the-wild. The good classification performance obtained in the conducted experiments suggests that the proposed method can efficiently navigate the noisy environment of in-the-wild recordings.","Accelerometers,artificial neural networks,medical diagnosis,smart devices,supervised learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHMS,DISEASE",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,https://zenodo.org/record/3676557/files/alpapado2019jbhi.pdf,

Most current works on this issue require a subject-specific adaptation step before applied to a new user. Thus the research of directly extending a pre-trained model to new users is particularly desired and indispensable. As brain dynamics fluctuate considerably across different subjects, it is challenging to design practical hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge. Regarding this gap, this paper proposes a Graph-based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Model (G-CRAM) to explore EEG features across different subjects for motor imagery classification. A graph structure is first developed to represent the positioning information of EEG nodes. Then a convolutional recurrent attention model learns EEG features from both spatial and temporal dimensions and emphasizes on the most distinguishable temporal periods. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark EEG datasets of motor imagery classification on the subject-independent testing. The results show that the G-CRAM achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods regarding recognition accuracy and ROC-AUC. Furthermore, model interpretation studies reveal the learning process of different neural network components and demonstrate that the proposed model can extract detailed features efficiently.","Electroencephalography,Brain modeling,Synchronous motors,Deep learning,Task analysis,Feature extraction,Informatics,EEG,Motor Imagery,Deep Learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,BRAIN-COMPUTER,INTERFACE,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,BCI,SELECTION,PATTERNS",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,,

The SPP is the main contributor to surface mounting technology (SMT) soldering defects. The prediction of abnormal conditions is necessary to enhance the first-pass yield and reduce the reworking costs of the printed circuit board (PCB) assembly line. In this research, a novel multiphase intelligent abnormality prognosis (IAP) framework is proposed. The model comprises two phases: the abnormality detection phase and the abnormality prediction phase. The first phase is to develop the random forest-based exponential weighted moving average (RF-based EWMA) control chart. The goal is to properly monitor the highly autocorrelated SPP process and effectively recognize the existing patterns. In the second phase, the accurate prediction of anomalies within the SPP before they arise is achieved. The integration of adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) predictive modeling and a moving recognition window approach is proposed. To discriminate the different patterns from each other, features are extracted using the sliding window, and then, the AdaBoost model is adopted to predict the occurrence of abnormal patterns in the SPP. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed framework in early and accurate prediction of abnormal patterns within the SPP process to prevent solder paste printing defects and reduce the high reworking costs for large-scale production.","Control charts,Printing,Predictive models,Process control,Manufacturing,Apertures,Packaging,Anomaly diagnosis,anomaly prognosis,ensemble learning,regression control chart,stencil printing process (SPP)",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Materials Science",,1.796,"DMAIC,APPROACH,CONTROL,CHART",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS PACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,

Here, the nanotomography setup at the imaging beamline P05 at PETRA III is presented, which offers high time resolution not only in absorption but for the first time also in Zernike phase contrast. Two test samples are used to evaluate the image quality in both contrast modalities based on the quantitative analysis of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and spatial resolution. High-quality scans can be recorded in 15 min and fast scans down to 3 min are also possible without significant loss of image quality. At scan times well below 3 min, the CNR values decrease significantly and classical image-filtering techniques reach their limitation. A machine-learning approach shows promising results, enabling acquisition of a full tomography in only 6 s. Overall, the transmission X-ray microscopy instrument offers high temporal resolution in absorption and Zernike phase contrast, enabling in situ experiments at the beamline.","nanotomography,full-field X-ray microscopy,in situ experiments,image quality,time resolution,Zernike phase contrast",Article,"INT UNION CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, 2 ABBEY SQ, CHESTER, CH1 2HU, ENGLAND","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,2.904,"RAY,TOMOGRAPHY,MICROTOMOGRAPHY,MICROSTRUCTURE,CONDENSER,NETWORK,OPTICS",JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION,https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/30080/-IUCr-Pushing-the-temporal-resolution-in-absorption-and-Zernike-phase-contrast-nanotomography_-enabling-fast-in-situ-experiments.pdf,

For this purpose, DFT modeling is performed to calculate basic electronic properties of various organic compounds, namely redox potential, electron affinity, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which are used in conjunction with basic molecular descriptors to train three machine learning models (ML): artificial neural networks (ANN), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), and kernel ridge regression (KRR) through three different protocols. These three protocols, or pipelines, are developed in order to enhance each model's capability to learn the data and make predictions. The first two pipelines utilize the original features only, while the third pipeline utilizes composite features which are screened by a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Particularly, the second and third pipelines employ a Pearson correlation analysis in conjunction with recursive feature elimination (RFE). From this study, the most important features to predict redox potential are identified as the electron affinity and the number of bound Li atoms. After optimizing machine learning models in each pipeline, it is found that KRR predicts the redox potential with the highest accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This work concentrates on the Physionet challenge database that stores PCG recordings for more than one thousand subjects, including healthy and pathological records. A complete methodology is provided to analyze and classify PCG data. The PCG signals are first filtered and segmented into different parts, then analyzed by applying a feature extraction process, followed by classifying the signal as that of a healthy or unhealthy person. The extracted optimal features subset includes statistical components, such as the mean and standard deviation from different parts of the signal, in addition to wavelet-based features. The classification mainly relies on bagging and boosting algorithms, as well as adequately preparing the data in order to yield an enhanced ensemble classifier. The work further provides the approach to combine multiple classification models to improve accuracy. The effect of segmenting the different beats of the PCG on classification scores is also addressed, and the results are shown to be of high precision with an accuracy score of 86.6% on the hidden test, in comparison with recent and best performing literature that achieved 86%. Also, the proposed methodology is extended to the Pascal heart sounds challenge with accurate results that exceed previous works confirming the performance and robustness of the work since it can be applied to multiple databases and sources.

Using established external-beam knowledge-based dose-volume histogram (DVH) estimation methods, we sought to predict bladder, rectum, and sigmoid D-2cc for tandem and ovoid treatments.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 136 patients with loco-regionally advanced cervical cancer treated with 456 (356:100 training:validation ratio) CT-based tandem and ovoid brachytherapy fractions were analyzed. Single fraction prescription doses were 5.5-8 Gy with dose criteria for the high-risk clinical target volume, bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. DVH estimations were obtained by subdividing training set organs-at-risk into high-risk clinical target volume boundary distance subvolumes and computing cohort-averaged differential DVHs. Full DVH estimation was then performed on the training and validation sets. Model performance was quantified by Delta D-2cc = D-2cc(actual)-D-2cc(predicted) (mean and standard deviation). Delta D-2cc between training and validation sets were compared with a Student's t test (p < 0.01 significant). Categorical variables (physician, fraction-number, total fractions, and case complexity) that might explain model variance were examined using an analysis of variance test (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01 threshold).
RESULTS: Training set deviations were bladder Delta D-2cc = -0.04 +/- 0.61 Gy, rectum Delta D-2cc = 0.02 +/- 0.57 Gy, and sigmoid Delta D-2cc = -0.05 +/- 0.52 Gy. Model predictions on validation set did not statistically differ: bladder Delta D-2cc = -0.02 +/- 0.46 Gy (p = 0.80), rectum Delta D-2cc = -0.007 +/- 0.47 Gy (p = 0.53), and sigmoid Delta D-2cc = -0.07 +/- 0.47 Gy (p = 0.70). The only significant categorical variable was the attending physician for bladder and rectum Delta D-2cc.
CONCLUSION: A simple boundary distance-driven knowledge-based DVH estimation exhibited promising results in predicting critical brachytherapy dose metrics. Future work will examine the utility of these predictions for quality control and automated brachytherapy planning. (C) 2020 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, Consistency based Feature Selection method is applied to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features. This method yields that substrate material does not affect the UWB characteristics of the antenna. Classification process is repeated for the reduced feature set, reaching to 97.44% accuracy rate.

This research combines ultrasonic measurements and machine learning methods to determine when fouling has been removed from a test section of pipework for a range of different food materials. The results show that the proposed methodology is successful in predicting when fouling is present on the test section with accuracies up to 99% for the range of different machine learning algorithms studied. Various aspects relating to the training data set and input data selection were studied to determine their effect on the performance of the different machine learning methods studied.

Capturing the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern unobtrusively of the patient or the potential patient has great significance. In the current work, we attempt to capitalize on depth camera and deep learning architecture to achieve the accurate and unobtrusive measurement of abnormal respiratory patterns, and the whole system can classify multiple people's respiratory patterns in a real-time manner. The challenges in this task are threefold: 1) the real-time online system means that the Region of Interest (ROI) needs to be located and tracked automatically; 2) the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to obtain the robust deep neural network; and 3) the intraclass variation is large and the outer class variation is small. Consequently, human joints tracking is applied to determine the location of subjects shoulder and chest. Based on the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient respiratory simulation model (RSM) is proposed to generate abundant and high-quality training data. Finally, we apply a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify six clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes, and Central-Apnea). The performance of the obtained BI-AT-GRU is tested by the data that is actually measured by the depth camera. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can classify six different respiratory patterns with the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 of 94.5%, 94.4%, 95.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. In comparative experiments, the obtained BI-AT-GRU specific to respiratory pattern classification outperforms the existing state-of-the-art, viz., BI-AT-LSTM, GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), and BI-AT-GRU. Moreover, other experimental results indicate that the proposed online measuring system, deep neural network, and the modeling ideas have the potential to be extended to the large-scale applications, such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.

The method was tested on experimental data set available on the Open Guided Waves platform. The qualitative comparison was performed on full wavefield data, whereas quantitative comparison was made directly on signals of propagating Lamb waves registered by piezoelectric transducers. In both cases, good agreement between numerical and experimental results was achieved. The proposed method is particularly useful for structural health monitoring algorithms in which signal parameters are required such as wave velocity dependence on the angle of propagation. Moreover, it enables model-assisted damage size estimation in which the damage influence curve is estimated based on large numerical data sets and sparse experimental data.

Efficient and precise diagnosis is quite critical for the subsequent therapeutic treatment of patients. So far, computer-aided diagnosis has not been widely applied in pathological field yet as currently well-addressed tasks are only the tip of the iceberg. Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a quite challenging problem. First, the scarcity of annotations heavily impedes the pace of developing effective approaches. Pixelwise delineated annotations on WSIs are time consuming and tedious, which poses difficulties in building a large-scale training dataset. In addition, a variety of heterogeneous patterns of tumor existing in high magnification field are actually the major obstacle. Furthermore, a gigapixel scale WSI cannot be directly analyzed due to the immeasurable computational cost. How to design the weakly supervised learning methods to maximize the use of available WSI-level labels that can be readily obtained in clinical practice is quite appealing. To overcome these challenges, we present a weakly supervised approach in this article for fast and effective classification on the whole slide lung cancer images. Our method first takes advantage of a patch-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to retrieve discriminative blocks and provides representative deep features with high efficiency. Then, different context-aware block selection and feature aggregation strategies are explored to generate globally holistic WSI descriptor which is ultimately fed into a random forest (RF) classifier for the image-level prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to exploit the potential of image-level labels along with some coarse annotations for weakly supervised learning. A large-scale lung cancer WSI dataset is constructed in this article for evaluation, which validates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method that surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin with an accuracy of 97.3%. In addition, our method also achieves the best performance on the public lung cancer WSIs dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We highlight that a small number of coarse annotations can contribute to further accuracy improvement. We believe that weakly supervised learning methods have great potential to assist pathologists in histology image diagnosis in the near future.","Cancer,Lung,Feature extraction,Tumors,Task analysis,Supervised learning,Image analysis,Deep learning,histology image analysis,weakly supervised learning,whole slide images (WSIs)",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,11.507,"PATHOLOGY,IMAGES,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,HISTOLOGY,FEATURES",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS,,

To address this issue, a new ETR energy calculation method for learning the EEG patterns of brain activities using a convolutional neural network is reported. It is able to customize temporal ETR training and recognize multiple objects within a common learning model. Specifically, an open-access dataset from the 2008 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV-2a is used for classification of five classes containing four Motor Imagery actions and one relax action. The proposed classification framework outperforms the best state-of-the-art classification method by 10.11% in average subject accuracy.

However, in real scenarios, image data is often partially or even incorrectly labeled. Particularly, in cell detection, this becomes a thorny issue since the labelling of the dataset is incomplete and inaccurate. To address this issue, we propose a data-augmentation algorithm that can generate full labeled cell image data from incomplete labeled ones.

However, empirical APT data often contain significant biases that lead to erroneous chemical concentration and isotopic abundance measurements. The present study explores the accuracy of quantitative isotopic analyses performed via atom probe mass spectrometry. A machine learning-based adaptive peak fitting algorithm was developed to provide a reproducible and mathematically defensible means to determine peak shapes and intensities in the mass spectrum for specific ion species. The isotopic abundance measurements made with the atom probe are compared directly with the known isotopic abundance values for each of the materials. Even in the presence of exceedingly high numbers of multi-hit detection events (up to 80%), and in the absence of any deadtime corrections, our approach produced isotopic abundance measurements having an accuracy consistent with values limited predominantly by counting statistics.","Atom probe,Mass spectrometry,Isotopic analysis,Peak fitting,Multi-hit detection events",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Microscopy,,2.771,"FIELD,EVAPORATION,TOMOGRAPHY,DETECTOR,EVENTS,DECONVOLUTION,OPTIMIZATION,PERFORMANCE,BORON,SIMS,TIME",ULTRAMICROSCOPY,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.113018,

Materials and Methods: A total of 59 digital images have been acquired from the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the prostatic tissue. In these 59 images, 169 regions were marked as sites of hyperplasia of the prostatic glandular component. The entire dataset has been divided into three classes, which included the training set containing 41 images (70% of the total images), that had 109 marked regions as prostatic hyperplasia, validation set contained 6 images (10% of total images), that had 19 marked regions as prostatic hyperplasia and Testing set contained 12 images (20% of total images), that had 41 marked regions as the hyperplasia of the glandular component of the prostatic tissue.
Results: A total of fifty-nine digital images containing one hundred and sixty-nine marked regions of glandular hyperplasia of prostatic tissue are used in which 70% were employed for training, 10 % for validation, and 20% for testing. The computer vision-based system has diagnosed correctly with 96.3% f1-score.
Discussion: The application of artificial intelligence with the help of computer is emerging an important technique that will improve the diagnostic accuracy and will reduce the chance of human errors. The development of pattern recognition algorithms may be of great help in the histopathological diagnosis in the near future.

Encoder-decoder architectures, such as U-Net, can be used in state-of-the-art models with powerful designs that are achieved by implementing skip connections that propagate local information from an encoder path to a decoder path to retrieve detailed spatial information lost by pooling operations. Despite their effectiveness for segmentation, these naive skip connections still have some disadvantages. First, multi-scale skip connections tend to use unnecessary information and computational sources, where likable low-level encoder features are repeatedly used at multiple scales. Second, the contextual information of the low-level encoder feature is insufficient, leading to poor performance for pixel-wise recognition when concatenating with the corresponding high-level decoder feature. In this study, we propose a novel spatial-channel attention gate that addresses the limitations of plain skip connections. This can be easily integrated into an encoder-decoder network to effectively improve the performance of the image segmentation task. Comprehensive results reveal that our spatial-channel attention gate remarkably enhances the segmentation capability of the U-Net architecture with a minimal computational overhead added.

Although a lot of research works have been proposed to improve CSP, most of these works have the problems of large computation costs and long feature extraction time. To this end, three new feature extraction methods based on CSP and a new feature selection method based on non-convex log regularization are proposed in this paper. Firstly, EEG signals are spatially filtered by CSP, and then three new feature extraction methods are proposed. We called them CSP-wavelet, CSP-WPD and CSP-FB, respectively. For CSP-Wavelet and CSP-WPD, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the spatially filtered signals, and then the energy and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients are extracted as features. For CSP-FB, the spatially filtered signals are filtered into multiple bands by a filter bank (FB), and then the logarithm of variances of each band are extracted as features. Secondly, a sparse optimization method regularized with a non-convex log function is proposed for the feature selection, which we called LOG, and an optimization algorithm for LOG is given. Finally, ensemble learning is used for secondary feature selection and classification model construction. Combing feature extraction and feature selection methods, a total of three new EEG decoding methods are obtained, namely CSP-Wavelet+LOG, CSP-WPD+LOG, and CSP-FB+LOG. Four public motor imagery datasets are used to verify the performance of the proposed methods. Compared to existing methods, the proposed methods achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 88.86, 83.40, 81.53, and 80.83 in datasets 1-4, respectively. The feature extraction time of CSP-FB is the shortest. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively improve the classification accuracy and reduce the feature extraction time.

Secondly, they undergo complex interactions in the machining zone.

Regarding self-monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long-term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers.","wearable activity trackers,disease flares,remote monitoring,rheumatic disease",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"INCREASE,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,PEDOMETER-DRIVEN,WALKING,AXIAL,SPONDYLOARTHRITIS,KNEE,OSTEOARTHRITIS,ARTHRITIS,FLARE,OLDER-ADULTS,E-HEALTH,EXERCISE,BEHAVIOR,BARRIERS",SENSORS,https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02954539/file/sensors-20-04797-v3.pdf,

In this paper, a novel neuromorphic vision-based tactile sensing approach for robotic sorting application is proposed. This approach has low latency and low power consumption when compared to conventional vision-based tactile sensing techniques. Two Machine Learning (ML) methods, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Dynamic Time Warping-K Nearest Neighbor (DTW-KNN), are developed to classify material hardness, object size, and grasping force. An Event-Based Object Grasping (EBOG) experimental setup is developed to acquire datasets, where 243 experiments are produced to train the proposed classifiers. Based on predictions of the classifiers, objects can be automatically sorted. If the prediction accuracy is below a certain threshold, the gripper re-adjusts and re-grasps until reaching a proper grasp. The proposed ML method achieves good prediction accuracy, which shows the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the developed SVM model outperforms the DTW-KNN model in term of accuracy and efficiency for real time contact-level classification.","robotics sorting,contact-level classification,neuromorphic vision,haptics,machine learning,dynamic vision sensor",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,SENSOR,SENSORS,https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/id/eprint/46847/1/Zweiri-Y-46847-VoR.pdf,

In this study, we proposed a time-advanced feature and utilized long short-term memory (LSTM) with a root mean square (RMS) feature and its time-advanced feature (RMSTAF; collectively referred to as RRTAF) of sEMG to estimate the knee joint angle. To evaluate the effect of joint angle estimation, we used root mean square error (RMSE) and cross-correlation coefficient rho between the estimated angle and actual angle. We also compared three methods (i.e., LSTM using RMS, BPNN (back propagation neural network) using RRTAF, and BPNN using RMS) with LSTM using RRTAF to highlight its good performance. Five healthy subjects participated in the experiment and their eight muscle (i.e., rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), gracilis (GC), semimembranosus (SM), sartorius (SR), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and tibialis anterior (TA)) sEMG signals were taken as algorithm inputs. Moreover, the knee joint angles were used as target values. The experimental results showed that, compared with LSTM using RMS, BPNN using RRTAF, and BPNN using RMS, the average RMSE values of LSTM using RRTAF were respectively reduced by 8.57%, 46.62%, and 68.69%, whereas the average rho values were respectively increased by 0.31%, 4.15%, and 18.35%.

System Realization Using Information Matrix (SRIM) method is performed in short duration sweeping time windows for identification of state matrices, and then, modal parameters with enhanced automation. Stable modal poles collected from stability diagrams are clustered and fed into the Gaussian distribution-based anomaly detection platform. Different anomaly thresholds are examined both on frequency and damping ratio terms taking two testbed bridge structures as application means, and simplistic Boolean Operators are performed to merge univariate anomalies. The first bridge is a reinforced concrete bridge subjected to incremental damage through a series of seismic shake table experiments conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno. The second bridge is a steel arch structure at Columbia University Morningside Campus, which reflects no damage throughout the measurements, unlike the first one. Two large-scale implementations indicate the realistic performance of automated modal analysis and anomaly recognition with minimal human intervention in terms of parameter extraction and learning supervision. Anomaly detection performance, presented in this paper, shows variation according to the designated thresholds, and hence, the information retrieval metrics being considered. The methodology is well-fitted to SHM problems which require sole data-driven, scalable, and fully autonomous perspectives.","system identification,structural health monitoring,system realization using information matrix,automated modal analysis,seismic damage assessment,anomaly detection",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"STATISTICAL,PATTERN-RECOGNITION,STABILIZATION,DIAGRAMS,IDENTIFICATION,INFORMATION",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/17/4752/pdf,

However, the complexity of PM distributions and the difficulty of reaching PM in deep soils prevent its detailed assessment. Proximal sensors, such as the por table X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF), might ease this process. This work attempts to prove the potential of pXRF to predict different PMs from analyses of soil samples. The study encompassed five Brazilian states representing 1,541,309.409 km(2), from where 310 soil samples of various soil classes derived from 12 different PMs were collected and analyzed by PXRF. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were used for modeling. Modeling comprised three datasets: one containing all data (310 samples), a dataset with younger soils (151 samples) and one with older soils, conceptually less influenced by their PM (159 samples), to understand how soil-PM chemical proximity affects prediction performance, assessed via overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Data distribution showed pXRF can discriminate PM types via their resulting soils, regardless of the degree of weathering. Prediction results were prominent: RF and SVM achieved roughly 0.9 Kappa and overall accuracy predicting all data. For the remaining datasets, SVM achieved 0.96 Kappa and RF nearly 0.92 for younger soils, and 0.87 and 0.9, respectively, for older soils, confirming that PMs of younger soils are slightly easier to predict, but even soils heavily altered by pedogenetic processes can be accurately predicted. Results confirm the pXRF potential to predict PM from soil data, which might help in soil mapping and its consequent activities in tropical conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To counteract the wear of the lining, gunning is used as a common procedure in steelmaking to prolong the usability of the lining. During gunning, a concretelike, moist refractory mass is applied to the lining surface by pumping it through a nozzle and pointing the spouting mass jet at the desired area. The optimal machine settings, e.g., pressure levels and mixture ratio, are crucial to the maintenance quality. These parameters are reflected in the gunning jet appearance and can be observed and interpreted by experienced operators. Video tracking of the gunning jet facilitates remote observation and is key to automated feature analysis. In this article, we focus on tracking the jet using infrared images. In particular, we use a particle filter with online learning to update the reference template. Template matching is used for tracker stabilization and object verification.

To achieve this goal, an embedded system has been equipped with an end-to-end deep-learning algorithm that does not require manual parameter tuning to perform a diagnosis. The proposed deep convolutional model, named BrightNet, is based on a single-shot detector neural network, modified to estimate the brightness of the detected fluorescent spots in a low-density protein or DNA microarray and finalize the diagnosis. Several optimization steps are presented to compress the inference model size, which is required for the deployment into a portable resource-constrained device. The resulting inference time is about 66 [ms] on an i7 3770K desktop CPU and is estimated to be lower than 5 [s] on an ARM-Cortex M7 considering 1.1 x 10(9) multiply-accumulate operations.

We here report that immune-related genes (IRGs) could effectively distinguish prognostically different HNSCC patients.
Materials and methods: MRNA levels of 1333 IRGs that from ImmPort database in HNSCC samples were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). H2o, a machine learning-based R package, was used for screening the top most representative genes from the IRGs. Univariate Cox-regression analysis was performed to identify prognostically-related genes based on the randomly generated training samples from TCGA set. LASSO Cox-regression analysis was applied for the construction of prognostic model for HNSCC. A total of six IRGs were finally retained for their prognostic significance and used for LASSO Cox-regression analysis.
Key findings: Samples from exclusive training and testing set that randomly generated from TCGA, and another independent validation set from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to the prognostic model. HNSCC samples within high-risk groups have significantly inferior overall survival (OS) compared with those within low-risk groups. Differences in genomic mutation landscape and tumor infiltration immune cells also exist between the two sample groups. What's more, risk score was proved to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC by stratification analysis.

Our model can take full advantage of features from the first stage network and make the cascaded structure more efficient. We also combine stacked small and large kernels with an inception-like structure to help our model to learn more patterns, which produces superior results for multi-organ segmentation. In addition, some small organs are commonly occluded by large organs and have unclear boundaries with other surrounding tissues, which makes them hard to be segmented. We therefore first locate the small organs through a multi-class network and crop them randomly with the surrounding region, then segment them with a single-class network.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-nine patients with AIP (65 men, 24 women; mean age, 59.7 +/- 13.9 [SD] years; range: 21-83 years) and 93 patients with PDAC (68 men, 25 women; mean age, 60.1 +/- 12.3 [SD] years; range: 36-86 years) were retrospectively included. All patients had dedicated dual-phase pancreatic protocol CT between 2004 and 2018. Thin-slice images (0.75/0.5 mm thickness/increment) were compared with thick-slices images (3 or 5 mm thickness/increment). Pancreatic regions involved by PDAC or AIP (areas of enlargement, altered enhancement, effacement of pancreatic duct) as well as uninvolved parenchyma were segmented as three-dimensional volumes. Four hundred and thirty-one radiomics features were extracted and a random forest was used to distinguish AIP from PDAC. CT data of 60 AIP and 60 PDAC patients were used for training and those of 29 AIP and 33 PDAC independent patients were used for testing.
Results: The pancreas was diffusely involved in 37 (37/89; 41.6%) patients with AIP and not diffusely in 52 (52/89; 58.4%) patients.

Materials and methods: A total of 147 patients were included in this retrospective single-center study. There were 12 men and 135 women with a mean age of 56.88 +/- 10.6 (SD) years (range: 28-87 years). For each patient, seven regions including four lumbar and three femoral including trochanteric, intertrochanteric and neck were segmented on bone mineral densitometry images and 54 texture features were extracted from the regions. The performance of four feature selection methods, including classifier attribute evaluation (CLAE), one rule attribute evaluation (ORAE), gain ratio attribute evaluation (GRAE) and principal components analysis (PRCA) along with four classification methods, including random forest (RF), random committee (RC). K-nearest neighbor (KN) and logit-boost (LB) were evaluated. Four classification categories, including osteopenia vs. normal, osteoporosis vs. normal, osteopenia vs. osteoporosis and osteoporosis + osteopenia vs. osteoporosis were examined for the defined seven regions. The classification model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The AUC values ranged from 0.50 to 0.78. The combination of methods RF + CLAE, RF + ORAE and RC + ORAE yielded highest performance (AUC = 0.78) in discriminating between osteoporosis and normal state in the trochanteric region. The combinations of RF + PRCA and LB + PRCA had the highest performance (AUC = 0.76) in discriminating between osteoporosis and normal state in the neck region.

Creating deep learning models also requires appropriately labeling x-ray positions and hardware presence. Our purpose is to train and test deep learning models to detect pelvic radiograph position, hardware presence, and pelvic and acetabular fractures in addition to hip fractures.
Material and methods: Data was retrospectively acquired between 8/2009-6/2019. A subset of the data was split into 4 position labels and 2 hardware labels to create position labeling and hardware detecting models. The remaining data was parsed with these trained models, labeled based on 6 ""separate"" fracture patterns, and various fracture detecting models were created. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and other output metrics were evaluated.
Results: The position and hardware models performed well with AUC of 0.99-1.00. The AUC for proximal femoral fracture detection was as high as 0.95, which was in line with previously published research. Pelvic and acetabular fracture detection performance was as low as 0.70 for the posterior pelvis category and as high as 0.85 for the acetabular category with the ""separate"" fracture model.

Methods and materials: Both, public and private datasets were used to train and validate DCNN. A combination of two DCNN and quantitative thresholding was used to classify axial CT slices to the abdominal region, classify voxels as fat and muscle and to differentiate between subcutaneous and visceral fat. For validation, patients undergoing repetitive examination (+/- 21 days) and patients who underwent concurrent bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were analyzed. Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), linear regression and Bland-Altman-Analysis were used as statistical tests.
Results: Results provided from the algorithm toolkit were visually validated. The automated classifier was able to extract slices of interest from the full body scans with an accuracy of 98.7 %. DCNN-based segmentation for subcutaneous fat reached a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.95. CCCs were 0.99 for both muscle and subcutaneous fat and 0.98 for visceral fat in patients undergoing repetitive examinations (n = 48).

The current prevailing methods to measure the strength of 2D materials normally involve sophisticated testing facilities and complicated procedures of sample preparation, which are usually costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective and rapid approach to characterizing the strength of 2D materials by processing optical microscope images of the mechanically exfoliated 2D materials. Specifically, a machine learning-based model is developed to automate the identification of 2D material flakes of different layers from the optical microscope images, followed by the determination of their lateral size. The statistical distribution of the flakes' size is obtained and used to estimate the strength of the associated 2D material based on a distribution-property relationship we developed before. A case study with graphene indicates that the present machine learning-based method, as compared to the previous manual one, enhances the efficiency of characterization by more than one order of magnitude with no sacrifice of the accuracy.

An approach is presented which attempts to overcome current shortcomings in the theoretical understanding of stopping power, as well as the methods used to interpret and exploit measured data. This is a considerable challenge, however the use of a novel machine learning methodology is shown to hold great promise in this endeavour: the ultimate aim being the ability to correctly predict the stopping value for any energy, ion and target combination, having no preexisting experimental data.
A random forest regression algorithm is trained using over 34,000 experimental measurements, representing stopping power values for 522 ion-target combinations across the energy range 10(-)3 to 10(2) MeV/amu, and ion and target atomic masses 1 to > 240. Evaluation is carried out using several fundamental error metrics, over the whole dataset as well as for individual combinations, to provide the most comprehensive understanding of performance when tested under strict cross-validation criteria. The resulting model is shown to yield predicted stopping power curves corresponding closely to those of the true experimental values, with an ability to generalise across target elements, compounds, mixtures, alloys and polymers, irrespective of phase, and for a wide range of ion masses.","Machine learning,Random forest,Stopping power,SRIM",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Nuclear Science & Technology,Physics",,1.312,"QSAR,VALIDATION,PARTICLES,MODELS,RANGE",NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10101647/7/Jackman_Manuscript.pdf,

We do so without engineering which transformations are useful allowing for arbitrary modifications of the visual input. As an instantiation of this idea we tackle a problem that affects and hurts millions worldwide: photosensitivity. Any time an affected person opens a website, video, or some other medium that contains an adverse visual stimulus, either intended or unintended, they might experience a seizure with potentially significant consequences. We show how a deep network can learn a video-to-video transformation rendering such stimuli harmless while otherwise preserving the video. This approach uses a specification of the adverse phenomena, the forward transformation, to learn the inverse transformation. We show how such a network generalizes to real-world videos that have triggered numerous seizures, both by mistake and in politically-motivated attacks. A number of complimentary approaches are demonstrated including using a hand-crafted generator and a GAN using a differentiable perceptual metric.

70,A Neural Element Method,17,7,,Liu G. R.,Liu GR,Liu GR,10.1142/S0219876220500218,University of Cincinnati,"Methods of artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to solve various science and engineering problems. TrumpetNets and TubeNets were recently proposed by the author for creating two-way deepnets using the standard finite element method (FEM) and smoothed FEM (S-FEM) as trainers. The significance of these specially configured ANNs is that the solutions to inverse problems have been, for the first time, analytically derived in explicit formulae.
This paper presents a novel neural element method (NEM) with a focus on mechanics problems. The key idea is to use artificial neurons to form elemental units called neural-pulse-units (NPUs), using which the shape functions can then be constructed, and used in the standard weak and weakened-weak (W2) formulations to establish discrete stiffness matrices, similar to the standard FEM and S-FEM. Theory, formulation and codes in Python are presented in detail. Numerical examples are then used to demonstrate this novel NEM. For the first time, we have made a clear connection in theory, formulations and coding, between ANN methods and physical-law-based computational methods. We believe that this novel NEM fundamentally changes the way of approaching mechanics problems, and opens a window of opportunity for a range of applications. It offers a new direction of research on unconventional computational methods. It may also have an impact on how the well-established weak and W2 formulations can be introduced to machine learning processes, for example, creating well-behaved loss functions with preferable convexity.","Artificial intelligence,artificial neural network,neural element,physic-law-based method,computational mechanics,computational method",Article,"WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD, 5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","Engineering,Mathematics",,1.861,"INVERSE,IDENTIFICATION,ELASTIC-WAVES,MATERIAL,CONSTANTS,TISSUE",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS,,

However, the parameters of laser systems used in surgical operations need to be adjusted very precisely. Otherwise, irreversible situations may occur especially in the operation of sensitive organs such as the brain. In order to avoid such undesirable situations, artificial intelligence algorithms are used in the fields of engineering, aerospace and automotive, especially in medicine and biomedical. In this study, it was aimed to automatically detect Coagulation (Co) and Carbonization (Ca) states using a total of 140 data obtained as a result of LITT experimental applications (1070 nm and seven different power density values) onex vivoliver tissue. In the first part of the study, which consists of two main stages, the data set was presented to seven different expert systems based on artificial intelligence (C4.5, KNN, ANN, RF, MLR, SMO-SVM and LWLDS), and automatically Co and Ca formations were determined. Among the proposed expert systems, the C4.5 algorithm showed the best performance with 100% accuracy and 0% error rate. In the second stage of the study, the same data set was given to Attribute Information Gain (AIG) ranking system, which was used to determine the minimum number of feature that would provide the maximum performance, and the gain values of the attributes were calculated. As a result of this application, the most effective feature was found to be Normalized Depth of Thermal Damage (NDeTD) with 100% accuracy rate. Thus, the purpose of using the AIG system has been successfully achieved. As a result, thanks to the expert systems presented within the scope of the study, Co and Ca formations were determined automatically with 100% success rate according to the required parameters without laser application onex vivoliver tissue. The fact that the aim of the study was realized with the highest success rate is thought to be the first in terms of contributing to the literature. Through this study, as a result of the laser treatment to be applied on cancerous tissue, it can be predicted whether the tissue will suffer irreversible damage and necessary precautions can be taken beforehand.","laser-induced thermal therapy,liver,ex vivo,artificial intelligence,machine learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Optics,Physics",,1.157,"HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA,MORPHOLOGICAL,FEATURES,ABLATION,STATISTICS,THERAPY,SYSTEM",LASER PHYSICS,,

During the accident, liquidation materials contaminated by radioactive fallout (e.g., contaminated soil and trees) were buried in so-called Radioactive Waste Temporary Storage Places (RWTSPs). The exact locations of these burials were not always sufficiently documented. However, for safety management, including eventual remediation works, it is crucial to know their locations and rely on precise hazard maps. Over the past 34 years, most of these so-called trenches and clamps have been exposed to natural processes. In addition to settlement and erosion, they have been overgrown with dense vegetation. To date, more than 700 burials have been thoroughly investigated, but a large number of burial sites (approximately 300) are still unknown. In the past, numerous burials were identified based on settlement or elevation in the decimeter range, and vegetation anomalies that tend to appear in the immediate vicinity. Nevertheless, conventional detection methods are time-, effort- and radiation dose-intensive. Airborne gamma spectrometry and visual ground inspection of morphology and vegetation can provide useful complementary information, but it is insufficient for precisely localizing unknown burial sites in many cases. Therefore, sensor technologies, such as UAV-based lidar and multispectral imagery, have been identified as potential alternative solutions. This paper presents a novel method to detect radioactive waste sites based on a set of prominent features generated from high-resolution remote sensing data in combination with a random forest (RF) classifier. Initially, we generate a digital terrain model (DTM) and 3D vegetation map from the data and derive tree-based features, including tree density, tree height, and tree species. Feature subsets compiled from normalized DTM height, fast point feature histograms (FPFH), and lidar metrics are then incorporated. Next, an RF classifier is trained on reference areas defined by visual interpretation of the DTM grid. A backward feature selection strategy reduces the feature space significantly and avoids overfitting. Feature relevance assessment clearly demonstrates that the members of all feature subsets represent a final list of the most prominent features. For three representative study areas, the mean overall accuracy (OA) is 98.2% when using area-wide test data. Cohens' kappa coefficient kappa ranges from 0.609 to 0.758. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of a trained classifier to an adjacent study area (OA = 93.6%, kappa = 0.452). As expected, when utilizing the classifier on geometrically incorrect and incomplete reference data, which were generated from old maps and orthophotos based on visual inspection, the OA decreases significantly to 65.1% (kappa = 0.481). Finally, detection is verified through 38 borings that successfully confirm the existence of previously unknown buried nuclear materials in classified areas. These results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is applicable to detecting area-wide unknown radioactive biomass burials in the ChEZ.","UAV,Lidar,Multispectral imagery,Radioactive waste sites,3D vegetation mapping,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Physical Geography,Geology,Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,9.948,"TREE,SPECIES,CLASSIFICATION,RANDOM,FOREST,CLASSIFIER,INTENSITY,DATA,CONTAMINATION,SEGMENTATION,IRRADIATION,EXTRACTION,TRENCH,RANGE",ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,,

Numerous applications of X-ray CT in medical diagnosis and materials characterization have been reported, many involving field-specific innovations in the imaging technology itself. Yet, quantitative summarization to link image features to properties of interest has been rare. We address this issue by employing state-of-the-art technics in scalar field topology for the summarization of X-ray CT images of an example biphasic system. By varying processing-parameters we create different microstructures, evolve them through accelerated thermal aging, CT-image them pre- and post-aged, and demonstrate the ability of our image summarization method to systematically track process- and age-related changes, which can often be very subtle. A novel aspect of the algorithm involves recognition over multiple resolution levels, which provides deeper insight into the pattern relationship between grain-like features and their neighbors. The method is general, adaptable to diverse image reconstruction methods and materials systems, and particularly useful in applications where practical constraints on the sample-size limits the reliable use of more complex models, e.g., convolutional neural networks.","Computed Tomography,Processing-Structure relationship,Structure-Function correlation,Topological Descriptor,Age-related changes",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.222,TOMOGRAPHY,COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0927025620302731,

Starting from a conventional return-mapping scheme, the algorithmic description of von Mises plasticity with isotropic hardening is mathematically reformulated such that the relationship between the strain and stress histories may be modeled through a neural network function. In essence, the neural network provides an estimate of the instantaneous elasto-plastic tangent matrix as a function of the current stress and plastic work density. For plane stress conditions, it thus describes a non-linear mapping from R-4 to R-6. The neural network function is first developed for uniaxial stress conditions including loading histories with tension-compression reversal. Special attention is paid to the identification of the network architecture and artifacts related to overfitting. Furthermore, the performance of networks featuring the same number of total parameters, but different levels of non-linearity, is compared. It is found that a fully-connected feedforward network with five hidden layers and 15 neurons per layer can describe the plane stress plasticity problem with good accuracy. The results also show that a high density of training data (of the order of ten to hundred thousand points) is needed to obtain reasonable estimates for arbitrary loading paths with strains of up to 0.2. The final neural network model is implemented into finite element software through the user material subroutine interface. A simulation of a notched tension experiment is performed to demonstrate that the neural network model yields the same (heterogeneous) mechanical fields as a conventional J2 plasticity model. The present work demonstrates that it is feasible to describe the stress-strain response of a von Mises material through a neural network model without any explicit representation of the yield function, flow rule, hardening law or evolution constraints. It is emphasized that the demonstration of feasibility is the focus of the present work, while the assessment of potential computational advantages is deferred to future research.","J2 plasticity,Machine learning,Elasto-plastic tangent modulus,Return mapping",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science,Mechanics",,7.389,"DYNAMIC,RECRYSTALLIZATION,DISLOCATION,DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,BEHAVIOR,TEMPERATURE,EVOLUTION,METALS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY,,

To avoid the use of parametric models (such as the lognormal model) to estimate fragility curves from a reduced number of numerical calculations, a methodology based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) coupled with an active learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. In practice, input excitation is reduced to some relevant parameters and then SVMs are used for a binary classification of the structural responses relative to a limit threshold of exceedance. Since the output is not binary but a real-valued score, a probabilistic interpretation of the output is exploited to estimate very efficiently fragility curves as score functions or as functions of classical seismic intensity measures.","Fragility curve,Active Learning,Support Vector Machines,Seismic intensity measure indicator",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Engineering,,5.628,"INTENSITY,MEASURES,TIME-HISTORIES,EARTHQUAKE,SIMULATION,UNCERTAINTY,VARIABILITY,PERFORMANCE,DESIGN,MODELS,STEEL",STRUCTURAL SAFETY,,

Vickers hardness is an important mechanical property for selection of a material. In this work, we develop an alternate approach, which uses the microstructures to estimate the hardness of a Co- and Ni- based superalloys. Advanced image processing techniques coupled with data-driven machine learning (ML) are used to predict the Vickers hardness of these superalloys. Complex image derived properties such as 2-point correlations and compositions of superalloys are utilized as a feature to develop highly accurate ML model. The ML model trained through Gaussian process regression (GPR) using microstructure and compositional features show unprecedented accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 and R-2 of 0.98. Further analysis of the model is done to establish a relationship between the Vickers hardness with microstructural and compositional parameters. Addition of certain compounds such as iron and titanium can in general lead to increase in Vickers hardness, while addition of elements such as aluminium, tantalum and hafnium negatively affect the Vickers hardness. Most importantly, the developed ML model is trained on experimental data, as opposed to simulated data, making our approach directly applicable for accurate prediction of Vickers hardness.

In this study, passive, active, and combined passive/active solutions in PCMs systems have been comprehensively reviewed, when being applied in heating, cooling and electrical systems, together with a dialectical analysis on advantages and disadvantages. In addition to novel system designs, interdisciplinary applications of machine learning have been reviewed and formulated, from perspectives of reliable structures, smart operational controls, and stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction. Furthermore, a generic methodology with a systematic and hierarchical procedure has been proposed, with the implementation of machine-learning based technique for optimisations during both design and operation periods.

Existing motion correction algorithms rely on the assumption that no information is missing during motions. However, this assumption does not hold when out-of-FOV motion happens. Currently available algorithms are not able to correct for image artifacts introduced by out-of-FOV motion. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating convolutional neural network (CNN) derived prior image into solving the out-of-FOV motion problem.
Methods and materials: A modified U-net network was proposed to correct out-of-FOV motion artifacts by incorporating motion parameters into the loss function. A motion model based data fidelity term was applied in combination with the CNN prediction to further improve the motion correction performance. We trained the CNN on 1113 MPRAGE images with simulated oscillating and sudden motion trajectories, and compared our algorithm to a gradient-based autofocusing (AF) algorithm in both 2D and 3D images. Additional experiment was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of transferring the networks to different dataset. We also evaluated the robustness of this algorithm by adding Gaussian noise to the motion parameters. The motion correction performance was evaluated using mean square error (NMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM).
Results: The proposed algorithm outperformed AF-based algorithm for both 2D (NMSE: 0.0066 +/- 0.0009 vs 0.0141 +/- 0.008, P < .01; PSNR: 29.60 +/- 0.74 vs 21.71 +/- 0.27, P < .01; SSIM: 0.89 +/- 0.014 vs 0.73 +/- 0.004, P < .01) and 3D imaging (NMSE: 0.0067 +/- 0.0008 vs 0.070 +/- 0.021, P < .01; PSNR: 32.40 +/- 1.63 vs 22.32 +/- 2.378, P < .01; SSIM: 0.89 +/- 0.01 vs 0.62 +/- 0.03, P < .01). Robust reconstruction was achieved with 20% data missed due to the out-of-FOV motion.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the proposed CNN-based motion correction algorithm can significantly reduce out-of-FOV motion artifacts and achieve better image quality compared to AF-based algorithm.","Motion correction,Machine learning,Convolutional neural networks,Out-of-FOV motion,Prior image",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"NAVIGATOR,ECHOES,RECONSTRUCTION,MRI,AUTOCORRECTION,IMAGES,FETAL",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,,

Written with modern simulation and data analysis workflows in mind, freud provides a Python interface to fast, parallelized C++ routines that run efficiently on laptops, workstations, and supercomputing clusters. The package provides the core tools for finding particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using these tools. As such, freud users can access standard methods such as the radial distribution function as well as newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of mean force and torque and local crystal environment analysis with equal ease. Rather than providing its own trajectory data structure, freud operates either directly on NumPy arrays or on trajectory data structures provided by other Python packages. This design allows freud to transparently interface with many trajectory file formats by leveraging the file parsing abilities of other trajectory management tools. By remaining agnostic to its data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any particle simulation, regardless of the original data representation or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as HOOMD-blue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to the current state of the system, allowing users to study phenomena such as nucleation and growth.

For safety evaluation of FGM structures, the volume fraction of FGM has been modelled through spatially dependent uncertainty as random field for the concerned composite. In order to solve the complex stochastic elastoplastic problem, a further developed machine learning aided technique called the extended support vector regression (X-SVR) with a generalized Dirichlet feature mapping function has been introduced and then, the corresponding probabilistic features, including the statistical moments, probability density functions (PDFs), and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), of the concerned structural responses can be effectively established for assessing the reliability of FGM structures. Moreover, the proposed approach is competent to deliver critical information regarding the uncertain system inputs which can be beneficial for subsequent safety assessment and structural designs for the FGM.

This motivates the development of an approach for the estimation of the volume of material transported in field operations by loader trucks. The proposed methodology employs a three-dimensional point cloud representation of the volume and is tested using a skid-steer loader. The volume estimation process involves the segmentation of the loader's bucket from the raw point cloud using machine learning techniques. The segmented point cloud is associated with a pre-constructed reference model of the empty bucket. The volume is computed from a surface model built using the alpha shape algorithm applied to the Delaunay triangulation of the segmented point cloud. Several field experiments were carried out using a stereo camera for five different volumes of material and the bucket at different heights. A 95% accuracy was obtained on average. The encouraging results suggest that effective volume estimation for different bucket types would be possible using the proposed methodology.","PRODUCTIVITY,LIDAR",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,8.0,"PRODUCTIVITY,LIDAR",AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,,

The current single-objective optimization models are not applicable to multi-objective optimization (MOO). This study proposes an MOO method based on machine learning (ML) and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize concrete mixture proportions. First, the performances of different ML models in the prediction of concrete objectives are compared on data sets collected from the published literature. The winner is selected as the objective function for the optimization procedure. In the optimization step, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize mixture proportions to achieve optimal objectives. The results show that the backpropagation neural network has better performance on continuous data (e.g., strength), whereas the random forest algorithm has higher prediction accuracy on more discrete data (e.g., slump). The Pareto fronts of a bi-objective mixture optimization problem for high-performance concrete and a tri-objective mixture optimization problem for plastic concrete are successfully obtained by the MOO model. The MOO model can serve as a design guide to facilitate decision-making before the construction phase. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Planning for this modality of treatment is both fundamental, time-consuming and prone to human-errors, leading to potentially avoidable delays in start of treatment. A fundamental step in radiotherapy planning is contouring of radiation targets, where medical specialists contouring, i.e., segment, the boundaries of the structures to be irradiated. Automating this step can potentially lead to faster treatment planning without a decrease in quality, while increasing time available to physicians and also more consistent treatment results. This can be framed as an image segmentation task, which has been studied for many decades in the fields of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. With the advent of Deep Learning, there have been many proposals for different network architectures achieving high performance levels. In this review, we searched the literature for those methods and describe them briefly, grouping those based on Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This is a booming field, evidenced by the date of the publications found. However, most publications use data from a very limited number of patients, which presents an obstacle to deep learning models training. Although the performance of the models has achieved very satisfactory results, there is still room for improvement, and there is arguably a long way before these models can be used safely and effectively in clinical practice.","Computer vision,Medical imaging,Machine learning,Segmentation,Radiotherapy",Review,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,3.951,RADIOTHERAPY,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/129011/3/415537.pdf,

For cubic perovskites, the lattice constant, a, representing the size of the unit cell, has a significant impact on the structural stability, bandgap structure, and thus materials performance. In this study, we develop the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model to shed light on the relationship among ionic radii, electronegativities, and lattice constants for cubic perovskite A(2)XY(6) compounds. A total of 79 samples with lattice constants ranging from 8.109 to 11.790 angstrom are examined. The model has a high degree of accuracy and stability, contributing to fast, robust, and low-cost estimations of lattice constants.","Lattice constant,Halide,Perovskite,Semiconductor,Machine learning,Gaussian process regression",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Materials Science,Mineralogy",,1.467,"CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,STRUCTURAL,REFINEMENT,SOLAR-CELL,POTASSIUM,POWDER,EFFICIENCY,PALLADIUM,AMMONIUM,RUBIDIUM,HALIDES",PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF MINERALS,,

In this study, measured data (the compressive strength of rubberized concrete and its impacting factors) were collected by literature review (457 samples). In order to accurately predict the compressive strength of rubberized concrete, four machine learning models [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), regression trees (RT), and random forests (RF)] were developed and compared to estimate the compressive strength of rubberized concrete, and the modeling results were compared with two traditional expressions. The model performance was evaluated using three performance indicators: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC), the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the RT model performs the best, followed by the ANN and RF in the model training phase. In the model testing phase, the ANN model performs the best, followed by the RT, RF, and KNN. The overall results indicated that the ANN model performs the best, followed by RT and RF, and the KNN model performs the worst. The ANN and RT models outperformed the two traditional expressions. The tree-based models (RT and RF) and KNN model may not be applicative to estimate the compressive strength of rubberized concrete due to the generally poor performances in the model testing phase compared with that in the model training phase. The results showed that the traditional ANN model is sufficient for the accurate estimation of the compressive strength of rubberized concrete when the model is properly trained. The results in the present research can provide reference for the prediction of the compressive strength of rubberized concrete, which will benefit engineering management and safety as well.","CRUMB RUBBER CONCRETE,TYRE RUBBER,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TIRE RUBBER,WASTE TIRES,PERFORMANCE,COMPOSITES,MIXTURES,WATER",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Physics,,3.304,"CRUMB,RUBBER,CONCRETE,TYRE,RUBBER,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TIRE,RUBBER,WASTE,TIRES,PERFORMANCE,COMPOSITES,MIXTURES,WATER",EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS,,

Therefore, the development of an AF detection system is of great significance to detect critical illnesses. In this paper, we proposed an automatic recognition method named CNN-LSTM to automatically detect the AF heartbeats based on deep learning. The model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract local correlation features and uses long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to capture the front-to-back dependencies of electrocardiogram (ECG) sequence data. The CNN-LSTM is feeded by processed data to automatically detect AF signals. Our study uses the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database to verify the validity of the model. We achieved a high classification accuracy for the heartbeat data of the test set, with an overall classification accuracy rate of 97.21%, sensitivity of 97.34%, and specificity of 97.08%.
