Researchers usually use image-processing algorithms to extract material features from that and then characterise the material microstructure. However, the microscopic images obtained by a microscope often have random damaged regions, which will cause the loss of information and thus inevitably influence the accuracy of microstructural characterisation, even lead to a wrong result. To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model. We evaluate our method on Al-La alloy microscopic images, which indicates that our method can achieve promising performance on inpainted and material microstructure characterisation results compared to other image inpainting software for both accuracy and time consumption. Lay Description A basic goal of materials data analysis is to extract useful information from materials datasets that can in turn be used to establish connections along the composition-processing-structure-properties chain. The microscopic images obtained by a microscope is the key carrier of material microstructural information. Researchers usually use image analysis algorithms to extract regions of interest or useful features from microscopic images, aiming to analyse material microstructure, organ tissues or device quality etc. Therefore, the integrity and clarity of the microscopic image are the most important attributes for image feature extraction. Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop various technologies to obtain perfect microscopic images. However, in practice, some extrinsic defects are often introduced during the preparation and/or shooting processes, and the elimination of these defects often requires mass efforts and cost, or even is impossible at present. Take the microstructure image of metallic material for example, samples prepared to microstructure characterisation often need to go through several steps such as cutting, grinding with sandpaper, polishing, etching, and cleaning. During the grinding and polishing process, defects such as scratches could be introduced. During the etching and cleaning process, some defects such as rust caused by substandard etching, stains etc. may arise and be persisted. These defects can be treated as damaged regions with nonfixed positions, different sizes, and random shapes, resulting in the loss of information, which seriously affects subsequent visual observation and microstructural feature extraction. To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model. We evaluate our method on Al-La alloy microscopic images, which indicates that our method can achieve promising performance on inpainted and material microstructure characterisation results compared to other image inpainting software for both accuracy and time consumption.","Deep learning,image inpainting,microscopic image processing",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Microscopy,,1.855,,JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY,,

Current practice involves an expert to inspect each piece of leather individually and detect defects manually. However, such a manual inspection is highly subjective and varies quite considerably from one assorter to another. Computer vision system for natural material like leather is a challenging research problem. This study describes the application of computer vision system to capture leather surface images and use of a novel Fast Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization (FCPSO) algorithm on a set of handcrafted texture features viz., GLCM and classified using supervised classifiers viz., Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), SVM, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). FCPSO using modified fitness function by selective band Shannon entropy is implemented to segment industrial leather images. Segmentation efficiency of the proposed FCPSO algorithm is evaluated and its performance is compared with other optimization algorithms. Efficiency of the segmentation algorithms is evaluated using performance measures such as average difference (AD), Area Error Rate (AER), Edge-based structural similarity index (ESSIM), F-Score, Normalized correlation coefficient (NK), Overlap Error (OE), structural content (SC), Structural similarity index (SSIM) and Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI). Correlation of the segmented area using FCPSO with the experts' ground truth is found to be high with R value of 0.84. Feature extraction is carried out using GLCM texture features and the most prominent features were selected using statistical t-test and correlation coefficient. Experimental results showed encouraging results for random forest classifier confirming the potential of the proposed system for automatic leather defect classification.","Image analysis,Leather surface defect detection,segmentation,Fast convergence particle swarm optimization,Ensemble classifier",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,"IMAGE,ALGORITHM,SEGMENTATION,STANDARD,FEATURES,BRAIN",MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

However, the widespread application of this data-driven technology is still challenged by the requirement of large training data, poor model interpretability, and hard-to-detect errors that undermine the soundness of conclusion. Here, we performed a systematic study for the modeling of the formation energies of inorganic compounds using deep learning. Our results proved the advantage of deep learning methods over several non-deep learning methods in this specific task and demonstrated the abstraction of knowledge using deep learning, which was a unique ability compared to non-deep learning methods. Several aspects that critically affected the conclusion were also highlighted, including the importance to rigorously compare model performance with the same dataset, the design of input representation, and the careful selection of model architecture. Findings from the current study demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning solving complicated problems in materials research and serve as new guidelines for future practicing of deep learning in this field.

Past studies have proven the feasibility of using vibrational measurements to detect damage but have not explored the full capabilities and limitations of vibrational testing. Here, we use a finite element model of a composite plate to characterize the natural frequency, mode shape, and mode curvature tests for a variety of delamination scenarios. We find that the mode curvature test is resource-intensive to conduct but provides the best resolution in both identifying and localizing delamination. On the other hand, the natural frequency test is simple and inexpensive to conduct but can only reliably identify the presence of delamination. Additionally, a machine learning model is implemented to augment the natural frequency test, allowing both localization of damage and quantification of its severity with only the natural frequencies of modes 1-6. We are able to interpret our model and discover a phase transition for natural frequencies with different sized delaminations. This testing framework allows rapid non-destructive analysis for the iterative design of composites, accelerating the development of novel delamination-resistant materials.

However, further progress in ORR activity requires evaluation of precursors and synthesis approaches. In response to this challenge, we generated a first of its kind experimental data set of 36 samples using high-throughput synthesis and activity measurements. Several control parameters (e.g., Fe precursor identity, the precursor content, and pyrolysis temperature) were varied. We then developed several state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based regression models to predict ORR activity, dependent on selected synthesis variables. Through an iterative algorithm, higher prediction accuracy (smaller root-mean-square error) was achieved. We identified that gradient boosting regression (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR), among several methods, work best for this data set. Aided by our ML-based surrogate models, we decided to alter catalyst synthesis conditions, which resulted in a 36% increase in measured ORR activity in comparison to the maximum ORR mass activity value of 21.9 A/g(catalyst) in the original data set.

However, fully automatic LV segmentation remains challenging due to the complex structure of cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) and the morphological changes of LV caused by various cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) for LV segmentation. Our network consists of two interactive subnetworks which utilize essentially identical but formally different labels in the hope that they can learn segmentation from different perspectives. The two subnetworks take the same cardiac MRI as input and output a pair of segmentation maps in different forms. After averaging the two segmentation maps obtained from the two subnetworks, we get the final contours of the endocardium (endo) and epicardium (epi) simultaneously. The proposed method is evaluated on the dataset provided by the Left Ventricle Full Quantification Challenge of MICCAI 2019. The average Dice scores on epi, endo, and myocardium (myo) reach 0.961, 0.949, and 0.867 respectively which outperform the other methods.

Deep learning-based diagnosis of nodules in lung CT images, however, is time-consuming and less accurate due to redundant structure and the lack of adequate training data. In this paper, a novel diagnosis method based on Deep Transfer Convolutional Neural Network (DTCNN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is explored, which merges the synergy of two algorithms to deal with benign-malignant nodules classification. An optimal DTCNN is first adopted to extract high-level features of lung nodules, which has been trained with the ImageNet dataset beforehand. After that, an ELM classifier is further developed to classify benign and malignant lung nodules. Two datasets, including the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) public dataset and a private dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China (FAH-GMU), have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. For LIDC-IDRI dataset, the experimental results show that our novel DTCNN-ELM model achieved the performance with an accuracy of 94.57%, a sensitivity of 93.69%, a specificity of 95.15%, an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 94.94%, and testing time per nodule of 0.5 ms, which has the most reliable results compared with current state-of-the-art methods.

11,Topology optimization under uncertainty using a stochastic gradient-based approach,62,5,2255-2278,"De Subhayan,Hampton Jerrad,Maute Kurt,Doostan Alireza","De S,Hampton J,Maute K,Doostan A",Doostan A,10.1007/s00158-020-02599-z,University of Colorado System,"Topology optimization under uncertainty (TOuU) often defines objectives and constraints by statistical moments of geometric and physical quantities of interest. Most traditional TOuU methods use gradient-based optimization algorithms and rely on accurate estimates of the statistical moments and their gradients, e.g., via adjoint calculations. When the number of uncertain inputs is large or the quantities of interest exhibit large variability, a large number of adjoint (and/or forward) solves may be required to ensure the accuracy of these gradients. The optimization procedure itself often requires a large number of iterations, which may render TOuU computationally expensive, if not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we here propose an optimization approach that generates a stochastic approximation of the objective, constraints, and their gradients via a small number of adjoint (and/or forward) solves, per optimization iteration. A statistically independent (stochastic) approximation of these quantities is generated at each optimization iteration. The total cost of this approach is only a small factor larger than that of the corresponding deterministic topology optimization problem. We incorporate the stochastic approximation of objective, constraints, and their design sensitivities into two classes of optimization algorithms. First, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and a number of its variants, which have been successfully applied to large-scale optimization problems for machine learning. Second, we study the use of the proposed stochastic approximation approach within conventional nonlinear programming methods, focusing on the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA). The performance of these algorithms is investigated with structural design optimization problems utilizing a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP), as well as an explicit level set method. These investigations, conducted on both two- and three-dimensional structures, illustrate the efficacy of the proposed stochastic gradient approach for TOuU applications.","Topology Optimization,Optimization under Uncertainty,Robust Design,Stochastic Gradient,Adam,AdaGrad",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Computer Science,Engineering,Mechanics",,4.715,"GEOMETRIC,UNCERTAINTIES,STRUCTURAL,OPTIMIZATION,SHAPE,MINIMIZATION,FILTERS,DESIGN",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04562,

Here, we challenge the Molecular Transformer model to predict reactions on carbohydrates where regio- and stereoselectivity are notoriously difficult to predict. We show that transfer learning of the general patent reaction model with a small set of carbohydrate reactions produces a specialized model returning predictions for carbohydrate reactions with remarkable accuracy. We validate these predictions experimentally with the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide involving regioselective protections and stereoselective glycosylations. The transfer learning approach should be applicable to any reaction class of interest. Organic reactions can readily be learned by deep learning models, however, stereochemistry is still a challenge.

Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics-such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)-and brain tissue deformation-based metrics-such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS).

To create a predictive machine learning model of neurodevelopmental outcomes using cerebral PASL perfusion. Materials and Methods:A total of 73 full-term neonates were evaluated. The cerebral perfusion values were compared by permutation test to identify brain regions with significant perfusion changes among 18 controls, 40 HIE/MRI circle minus patients, and 15 HIE/MRI circle plus patients. A machine learning model was developed to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes using the averaged perfusion in those identified brain regions. Results:Significantly decreased PASL perfusion in HIE/MRI circle minus group, when compared with controls, were found in the anterior corona radiata, caudate, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus. Both significantly increased and decreased cerebral perfusion changes were detected in HIE/MRI circle plus group, when compared with HIE/MRI circle minus group. There were no significant perfusion differences in the cerebellum, brainstem and deep structures of thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus among the three groups. The machine learning model demonstrated significant correlation (p< 0.05) in predicting language(r= 0.48) and motor(r= 0.57) outcomes in HIE/MRI circle minus patients, and predicting language(r= 0.76), and motor(r= 0.53) outcomes in an additional group combining HIE/MRI circle minus and HIE/MRI circle plus. Conclusion:Perfusion MRI can play an essential role in detecting HIE regardless of findings on conventional MRI and predicting language and motor outcomes in HIE survivors. The perfusion changes may also reveal important insights into the reperfusion response and intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms.

The present study examines the feasibility of measuring hemodynamic activity in the PFC in response to the structure of practice and during treatment. This multiple-baseline single case-design study involving two individuals with chronic acquired apraxia of speech measured the hemodynamic changes in PFC activity during treatment across the intervention period using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Two models-a generalized linear model and a spatial varying coefficient model-are used to distinguish the repeated measures of PFC activity differences corresponding to the stage of practice and time of intervention. There were significant differences in the pattern of PFC activity associated with the structure of practice and the time of intervention. The outcomes from this pilot study demonstrate the utility of fNIRS to identify cognitive effort during speech motor learning.

However, this large degree of freedom has hindered the deterministic design of disordered systems for target functionalities. Here, we employ a machine learning approach for predicting and designing wave-matter interactions in disordered structures, thereby identifying scale-free properties for waves. To abstract and map the features of wave behaviors and disordered structures, we develop disorder-to-localization and localization-to-disorder convolutional neural networks, each of which enables the instantaneous prediction of wave localization in disordered structures and the instantaneous generation of disordered structures from given localizations. We demonstrate that the structural properties of the network architectures lead to the identification of scale-free disordered structures having heavy-tailed distributions, thus achieving multiple orders of magnitude improvement in robustness to accidental defects. Our results verify the critical role of neural network structures in determining machine-learning-generated real-space structures and their defect immunity.

When a structure suffers from damage, it is necessary to implement maintenance programs for returning the structural performance and integrity to its initial normal condition. An important challenge is that the structure of interest may be damaged even after a sophisticated maintenance program. This conveys the great necessity of performing the second level of structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures. To achieve this aim, this article proposes a novel methodology using the concept of supervised learning. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to train various supervised learning classifiers using a training dataset that consists of features regarding both the undamaged and damaged states of the structure before the maintenance program in the first level. Once the classifiers have been trained, one attempts to predict the class labels of test samples associated with the current state of the structure after the maintenance program during the second level. According to the predefined class labels of the training and test samples in the first stage, it is feasible to recognize the current state of the maintained structure in the second level and detect potential damage. The major contribution of this article is to introduce the concept of supervised learning for damage detection in an innovative manner. A numerical concrete beam and an experimental laboratory frame are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results show that this methodology is a practical and reliable tool for structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures.","Structural health monitoring,Damage detection,Statistical pattern recognition,Supervised learning,Classification,Maintained civil structures",Article,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,1.476,"PRINCIPAL,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,DAMAGE,DETECTION,SENSITIVITY,DIAGNOSIS,MODELS",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,,

Our results reveal that, beyond Vonnegut's connection with the lattice match to ice, three new microscopic factors help to predict the ice nucleating ability. These are: local ordering induced in liquid water, density reduction of liquid water near the surface and corrugation of the adsorption energy landscape felt by water. With this we take a step towards quantitative understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation and the in silico design of materials to control ice formation. Heterogenous ice nucleation is a ubiquitous phenomenon, but predicting the ice nucleation ability of a substrate is challenging.

Though, image segmentation using deep learning techniques is achieving remarkable results, it leverages on large-scale labeled datasets. But, in the field of medical imaging, it is challenging to acquire large labeled datasets. Hence, this article proposes a novel deep learning model to automatically segment the optic disc in retinal fundus images by using the concepts of semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. Initially, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is trained to automatically learn features from a large number of unlabeled fundus images available from the Kaggle's diabetic retinopathy (DR) dataset. The autoencoder (AE) learns the features from the unlabeled images by reconstructing the input images and becomes a pre-trained network (model). After this, the pre-trained autoencoder network is converted into a segmentation network. Later, using transfer learning, the segmentation network is trained with retinal fundus images along with their corresponding optic disc ground truth images from the DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets. The trained segmentation network is then tested on retinal fundus images from the test set of DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods achieving a 0.967 and 0.902 dice score coefficient on the test set of the DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets respectively. The proposed method also shows that transfer learning and semi-supervised learning overcomes the barrier imposed by the large labeled dataset.

In this study, we propose the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and automated deep learning to non-invasively evaluate hair and follicle counts that may be used to monitor the success of hair growth therapy more accurately and efficiently. Study Design/Materials and Methods We collected 70 OCT scans from 14 patients with alopecia and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically count all follicles present in the scans. The model is based on a dual approach of both detecting hair follicles and estimating the local hair density in order to give accurate counts even for cases where two or more adjacent hairs are in close proximity to each other. Results We evaluate our system on 70 OCT manually labeled scans taken at different scalp locations from 14 patients, with 20 of those redundantly labeled by two human expert OCT operators. When comparing the individual human predictions and considering the exact locations of hair and follicle predictions, we find that the two human raters disagree with each other on approximately 22% of hairs and follicles. Overall, the deep learning (DL) system predicts the number of follicles with an error rate of 11.8% and the number of hairs with an error rate of 18.7% on average on the 70 scans. The OCT system can capture one scalp location in three seconds, and the DL model can make all predictions in less than a second after processing the scan, which takes half a minute using an unoptimized implementation. Conclusion This approach is well-positioned to become the standard for non-invasive evaluation of hair growth treatment progress in patients, saving significant amounts of time and effort compared with manual evaluation.

Retinal blood vessels are the most easily visible vessels in the whole body, and therefore, play a key role in the diagnosis of numerous diseases and eye disorders. Systematic and eye diseases cause morphologic variations, such as the growing, narrowing or branching of retinal blood vessels. Imaging-based screening of retinal blood vessels plays an important role in the identification and follow-up of eye diseases. Therefore, automatic retinal vessel segmentation can be used to diagnose and monitor those diseases. Computer-aided algorithms are required for the analysis of progression of eye diseases. This study proposes a hybrid method that provides a combination of pre-processing and data augmentation methods with a deep learning model. Pre-processing was used to solve the irregular clarification problems and to form a contrast between the background and retinal blood vessels. After pre-processing step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and then trained for the extraction of retinal blood vessels. In the training phase, data augmentation was performed to improve training performance. The CNN was trained and tested in the DRIVE database, which is commonly used in retinal blood vessel segmentation and publicly available for studies in this area. Results showed that the proposed system extracted vessels with a sensitivity of 77.78%, specificity of 97,84%, precision of 84.17% and accuracy of 95.27%.

Materials and methods In total, 11 789 patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy from three clinical trials, RENAAL (n = 1513), IDNT (n = 1715) and ALTITUDE (n = 8561), were used in this study. Eighteen baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were used as predictors to train machine-learning models to predict ESRD (doubling of serum creatinine and/or ESRD). We used the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) to assess the prediction performance of models and compared this with traditional Cox proportional hazard regression and kidney failure risk equation models. Results The feed forward neural network model predicted ESRD with an AUC of 0.82 (0.76-0.87), 0.81 (0.75-0.86) and 0.84 (0.79-0.90) in the RENAAL, IDNT and ALTITUDE trials, respectively. The feed forward neural network model selected urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, serum albumin, uric acid and serum creatinine as important predictors and obtained a state-of-the-art performance for predicting long-term ESRD. Conclusions Despite large inter-patient variability, non-linear machine-learning models can be used to predict long-term ESRD in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy using baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.

The recent advancements in deep learning techniques increase the computational powers to extract vital features without human intervention. The automatic detection and segmentation of subtle tissue such as the internal auditory canal (IAC) and its nerves is a challenging task, and it can be improved using deep learning techniques. Methods The main scope of this research is to present an automatic method to detect and segment the IAC and its nerves like the facial nerve, cochlear nerve, inferior vestibular nerve, and superior vestibular nerve. To address this issue, we propose a Mask R-CNN approach driven with U-net to detect and segment the IAC and its nerves. The Mask R-CNN with its backbone network of the RESNET50 model learns a background-based localization policy to produce an actual bounding box of the IAC. Furthermore, the U-net segments the structure related information of IAC and its nerves by learning its features. Results The proposed method was experimented on clinical datasets of 50 different patients including adults and children. The localization of IAC using Mask R-CNN was evaluated using Intersection of Union (IoU), and segmentation of IAC and its nerves was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient. Conclusions The localization result shows that mean IoU of RESNET50, RESNET101 are 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. The Dice similarity coefficient of IAC and its nerves using region growing, PSO and U-net method scored 92%, 94%, and 96%, respectively. The result shows that the proposed method outperform better in localization and segmentation of IAC and its nerves. Thus, AI aids the radiologists in making the right decisions as the localization and segmentation of IAC is accurate.","Mask R-CNN,U-net,Localization,Segmentation,Internal auditory canal",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,U-NET,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

The image analysis method utilizes a plugin for FIJI, built around Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) Segmentation. After cross-validation of this automated image analysis with manual shape tracing, the assay was applied to primary human lung fibroblasts including cells isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. In the absence of any exogenous stimuli, the analysis showed significantly faster and more extensive contraction of the diseased cells compared to the healthy ones. Upon stimulation with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), fibroblasts from the healthy donor showed significantly more contraction throughout the observation period while differences in the response of diseased cells was subtle and could only be detected during a smaller window of time.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the melt crystallization mechanism remains poor. This is because the molecular-scale structures of melts are difficult to clarify experimentally. Computer simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD), are often used to investigate melt structures. However, the time evolution of the structural order in a melt during crystallization must be analyzed properly. In this study, dimensional reduction (DR), which is an unsupervised machine learning technique, is used to evaluate the time evolution of structural order. The DR is performed for high-dimensional data representing an atom-atom pair distribution function and the distribution function of the angle formed by three nearest neighboring atoms at each period during crystallization, which are obtained by an MD simulation of a supercooled Lennard-Jones melt. The results indicate that crystallization occurs via the following activation processes: nucleation of a crystal with a distorted structure and reconstruction of the crystal to a more stable structure. The time evolution of the local structures during crystallization is also evaluated with this method. The present method can be applied to studies of the mechanism of crystallization from a disordered system for real materials, even for complicated multicomponent materials.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION,CALCIUM-CARBONATE,CLATHRATE HYDRATE,GROWTH-KINETICS,MAGNESIUM-IONS,EQUILIBRIUM,INTERFACES,ANISOTROPY,SURFACE,WATER",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,CALCIUM-CARBONATE,CLATHRATE,HYDRATE,GROWTH-KINETICS,MAGNESIUM-IONS,EQUILIBRIUM,INTERFACES,ANISOTROPY,SURFACE,WATER",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508891,

The objective of this study was to construct a procedural planning tool to optimize the proximal junction angle (PJA) to prevent postoperative proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) for each scoliosis patient. Methods. Twelve patients (9 patients without PJK and 3 patients with PJK) who have been followed up for at least 2 years after surgery were included. After calculating the loading force on the cephalad intervertebral disc of upper instrumented vertebra of each patient, the finite-element method (FEM) was performed to calculate the stress of each element. The stress information was summarized into the difference value before and after operation in different regions of interest. A two-layer fully connected neural network method was applied to model the relationship between the stress information and the risk of PJK.

In recent years, many of the bimetallic alloy catalysts with (100) as the predominant facet have shown outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, alloying effects on the activity at (100) were less explored, compared to the well-studied close-packed surfaces. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the catalytic activity of bimetallic alloy (100) surfaces for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The ensemble and compositional effects of (100) facets alloyed by strong- (Pd and Pt) and weak-binding (Ag, Au, and Cu) transition metals were studied. Based on DFT calculations, the catalytic activities of bimetallic alloys for the HER were systematically investigated using H binding energy as the reaction descriptor, at all of the typical surface ensembles on (100). Our results suggest that PdxAg1-x and PdxAu1-x(100) have promising theoretical HER activity in acidic media, due to the presence of highly active four-fold ensembles which reach the peak of the HER volcano activity plot. The electronic structure and stability of the alloys with predicted promising HER activities were studied. Furthermore, based on the DFT-calculated database, we performed feature analysis and developed a machine learning model which can help to predict HER activities of those out-of-sample alloys. Most importantly, this study provides helpful guidelines for the design of (100) dominated bimetallic alloys towards promising HER activity.","TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,ELECTROCATALYTIC MATERIALS,NANOPARTICLES,ADSORPTION,REDUCTION,ENSEMBLE,LIGAND,NANOCRYSTALS,ACTIVATION,NANOSHEETS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Energy & Fuels,Materials Science",,11.995,"TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,ELECTROCATALYTIC,MATERIALS,NANOPARTICLES,ADSORPTION,REDUCTION,ENSEMBLE,LIGAND,NANOCRYSTALS,ACTIVATION,NANOSHEETS",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A,,

Various studies have shown a significant dependence of the welding quality on the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. Frequently, an inappropriate setting of these parameters can be detected through an examination of the resulting surface defects, such as increased flash formation or surface galling. In this work, two different learning-based algorithms were applied to improve the surface topography of friction stir welds. For this purpose, the surface topographies of 262 welds, which were performed as part of ten studies, were evaluated offline. The aim was to use reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization approaches to determine the most appropriate settings for the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. The optimization problem was solved using reinforcement learning, specifically value iteration. However, the value iteration algorithm was not efficient, since all actions and states had to be iterated over, i.e., each possible parameter combination had to be evaluated, to find the best policy. Instead, it was better to solve the optimization problem directly using the Bayesian optimization. Two approaches were applied: both an approach in which the information from the other studies was not used and an approach in which the information from the other studies was used. On average, both the Bayesian optimization approaches found suitable welding parameters significantly faster than a random search algorithm, and the latter approach improved the result even further compared with the former approach. Future research will aim to show that optimization of the surface topography also leads to an increase in the ultimate tensile strength.","Artificial intelligence,Friction stir welding,Reinforcement learning,Bayesian optimization,Surface quality",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,PARAMETERS,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00170-020-05696-x.pdf,

In this study, the deep transfer learning strategy based on a fully 3D patch-based U-Net was investigated on a(18)F-fluoromisonidazole (F-18-FMISO) dataset using single-bed scanning and a(68)Ga-DOTATATE dataset using whole-body scanning. The datasets of(18)F-FDG by single-bed scanning and whole-body scanning were used to obtain pre-trained U-Nets separately for subsequent cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning. The full-dose PET images were used as the labels while low-dose PET images from 10% counts were used as the inputs. Three types of U-Nets were obtained: a U-Net trained by FDG dataset, a pre-trained FDG U-Net fine-tuned by another less-available tracer (FMISO/DOATATE), and a U-Net completely trained by a large number of less-available tracer datasets (FMISO/DOATATE), used as the reference U-Net. The denoising performance of the three types of U-Nets was evaluated on single-bed(18)F-FMISO and whole-body(68)Ga-DOTATATE separately and compared using normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and relative bias of region of interest (ROI). For cross-tracer transfer learning, all the U-Nets provided denoised images with similar quality for both tracers. There was no significant difference in terms of NRMSE and SNR when comparing the former two U-Nets with the reference U-Net. The ROI biases for these U-Nets were similar. For cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning, the pre-trained single-bed FDG U-Net fine-tuned by whole-body DOTATATE data provided the most consistent images with the reference U-Net. Fine-tuning significantly reduced the NRMSE and the ROI bias and improved the SNR when comparing the fine-tuned U-Net with the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG only (NRMSE: 96.3% +/- 21.1% versus 120.6% +/- 18.5%, ROI bias: -10.5% +/- 13.0% versus -14.7% +/- 6.4%, SNR: 4.2 +/- 1.4 versus 3.9 +/- 1.6, for fine-tuned U-Net and the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG, respectively, withp< 0.01 in all cases). This work demonstrated that it is feasible to utilize existing networks well-trained by FDG datasets to reduce the noise for other less-available tracers and other scanning protocols by using the fine-tuning strategy.","deep transfer learning,noise reduction,cross tracer,cross protocol,low-dose PET",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"IMAGE,SNR",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

To improve the prediction accuracy of respiratory signals by adapting the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) model to changing respiratory signals. We have previously developed an MLP-NN to predict respiratory signals obtained from a real-time position management (RPM) device. Preliminary testing results indicated that poor prediction accuracy may be observed after several seconds for irregular breathing patterns as only a set of fixed data was used in one-time training. To improve the prediction accuracy, we introduced a continuous learning technique using the updated training data to replace one-time learning using the fixed training data. We carried on this new prediction using an adaptation approach with dual MLP-NNs rather than single MLP-NN. When one MLP-NN was performing prediction of the respiratory signals, another one was being trained using the updated data and vice versa. The predicted performance was evaluated by root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the predicted and true signals from 202 patients' respiratory patterns each with 1 min recording length. The effects of adding an additional network, training parameter, and respiratory signal irregularity on the performance of the new predictor were investigated based on four different network configurations: a single MLP-NN, high-computation dual MLP-NNs (U1), two different combinations of high- and low-computation dual MLP-NNs (U2 and U3). The RMSEs using U1 method were reduced by 34%, 19%, and 10% compared to those using MLP-NN, U2 and U3 methods, respectively. Continuous training of an MLP-NN based on a dual-network configuration using updated respiratory signals improved prediction accuracy compared to one-time training of an MLP-NN using fixed signals.","radiation therapy,dynamic tracking,artificial neural network,respiratory motion prediction,multi-layer perceptron neural network",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"TUMOR,MOTION,AVERAGE,MODEL",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670491,

It spreads quickly at a frightening pace to all parts of the body and early detection of such diseases may help reduce the risks. Many methods have been used to classify and predict the outcome of cancer, such as image processing techniques, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. Out of these methods, artificial intelligence techniques have played an essential role and have provided satisfying results from different investigations in various fields. Considering that cancer is a genetic disease, electron-ion interaction pseudo potential can be used to convert DNA sequences from string shape into number values so that genomic signal processing can be applied for the feature extraction step. In this paper, 51 healthy and 51 cancer genes from multiple cells obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genbank were used for analysis. Then, 7 invariant moments were extracted into 2 types of learning machine methods: supervised and unsupervised learning.

These tests, a resemblance to machine learning algorithm were required to examine the sequential shock of unobserved features of series not reported in traditional Granger-causality tests. The empirical results found a short-run relationship between renewables and economic growth, suggesting a strong effect of wealth on renewable energy consumption. We confirmed a strong and long-term metallurgical coal-controlled metal footprint through steelmaking, and coal-driven energy-based economic structure. The feedback hypothesis was validated between biomass consumption and economic growth. There was evidence that metal ore consumption predicts economic growth, income level and renewable energy consumption while it causes ambient air pollution.

In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to the color fundus images for the automatic detection of glaucoma. Compared to the existing automatic screening methods, CNNs have the ability to extract the distinct features directly from the fundus images. In this paper, a deep learning architecture based on a CNN is designed for the classification of glaucomatous and normal fundus images. An 18-layer CNN is designed and trained to extract the discriminative features from the fundus image. It comprises of four convolutional layers, two max pooling layers, and one fully connected layer. A two-stage tuning approach is proposed for the selection of suitable batch size and initial learning rate. The proposed network is tested on DRISHTI-GS1, ORIGA, RIM-ONE2 (release 2), ACRIMA, and large-scale attention-based glaucoma (LAG) databases. Rotation data augmentation technique is employed to enlarge the dataset. Randomly selected 70% of images are used for training the model and remaining 30% images are used for testing.

The use of machine vision technology to automatically detect the defects of products has become an indispensable means for better quality control. A machine vision-based surface quality inspection system is usually composed of two processes: image acquisition and automatic defect detection.

In the proposed approach, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) that realizes fast defect detection while maintaining high accuracy is designed. Our proposed approach makes four contributions. First, we introduce the depthwise separable convolution to reduce the calculation time. Second, we improve the squeeze-and-excitation block to improve network performance. Third, we introduce the squeeze-and-expand mechanism to reduce the computation cost. Fourth, we employ a smoother activation function (Mish) to allow improved information flow. The proposed network is compared with the benchmark CNNs (including Inception, ResNet and MobileNet). The experimental results show that compared with the benchmark networks, our proposed network has achieved the best results regarding the accuracy and suboptimal results in terms of the speed compared with the benchmark networks.

The goal of this paper is to provide context for the application of machine learning to materials processing. The general landscapes of data science and materials processing are presented, using the foundry and the metal casting industry as an exemplar. The challenges that exist with typical foundry data are that the data are unbalanced, semi-supervised, heterogeneous, and limited in sample size. Data science methods to address these issues are presented and discussed. The elements of a data science project are outlined and illustrated by a case study using sand cast foundry data.

The visual analysis of a patient's X-ray chest radiograph by an experienced doctor takes about 5 to 15 minutes. When cases are concentrated, this will undoubtedly put tremendous pressure on the doctor's clinical diagnosis. Therefore, relying on the naked eye of the imaging doctor has very low efficiency. Hence, the use of artificial intelligence for clinical image diagnosis of pneumonia is a necessary thing. In addition, artificial intelligence recognition is very fast, and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved better performance than human beings in terms of image identification. Therefore, we used the dataset which has chest X-ray images for classification made available by Kaggle with a total of 5216 train and 624 test images, with 2 classes as normal and pneumonia.

Identification of these defects has the potential to improve cell performance and reliability. The impact of bulk defects on minority carrier lifetime is commonly measured using temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy and the defect parameters, such as its energy level and capture cross-section ratio, are usually extracted by fitting the Shockley-Read-Hall equation. We propose an alternative extraction approach by using machine learning trained on more than a million simulated lifetime curves, achieving coefficient of determinations between the true and predicted values of the defect parameters above 99%. In particular, random forest regressors, show that defect energy levels can be predicted with a high precision of +/- 0.02 eV, 87% of the time. The traditional approach of fitting to the Shockley-Read-Hall equation usually yields two sets of defect parameters, one in each half bandgap. The machine learning model is trained to predict the half bandgap location of the energy level, and successfully overcome the traditional approach's limitation. The proposed approach is validated using experimental measurements, where the machine learning predicts defect energy level and capture cross-section ratio within the uncertainty range of the traditional fitting method.

Generally, in the Superpave design system asphalt binder is selected based on the binder PG grade required for the climate. However, to implement performance control through the traditional Superpave PG system during mix design faces more challenges due to the changes of oil refinery, asphalt binder modification, and the use of recycled materials in the mixture. This paper aims to investigate the role of asphalt binders and mix designs in the rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures. A total of 22 plant-produced mixtures from 10 states and 5 laboratory-produced mixtures were investigated for their rutting performance in this study. Those tested mixtures include various binder grades, aggregate sources, RAP contents, and mix designs. The Superpave binder rutting parameter G*/sin delta and Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery (MSCR) grade parameter Jnr3.2 are correlated with the mixture dynamic modulus and Hamburg Wheel Tracking (HWT) rutting parameters. In addition, the effects of other mix design variables on the rutting resistance are evaluated using a statistical analysis. The results show that by incorporating the binder properties and mix design variables, the stepwise regression fitting provides a much better prediction for HWT rutting parameters as compared to using only the binder properties. This indicates the importance of proper selection of the binder grade for mixture performance, and it also calls for justifying more focus on including mixture design variables to ensure acceptable mixture rutting performance. The statistical analysis can provide an insight into the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by generating mathematical models for evaluating which mixture design variables are needed for better prediction of rutting performance.","Rutting resistance,Hamburg Wheel Tracking,dynamic modulus,Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery,stepwise regression",Article; Early Access,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Materials Science",,3.858,"DYNAMIC,MODULUS,HMA",ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN,,

Electronic nose sensors S2, S5, S8, S10 were determined as feature sensors by principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The univariate linear model of NMR parameters and electronic nose characteristic sensors show high correlation. Furthermore, ANN and PLS garlic flavor prediction model were established, although the PLS model was not as good as the BP-ANN model (R(P)(2)of 0.9713 and 0.9975) to monitor flavor changes, it also yields relatively accurate prediction performance with R(P)(2)of 0.9418 and 0.9633 for mid-shortwave infrared drying and microwave vacuum drying, respectively.","LF-NMR,garlic,flavor,artificial neural network,partial least squares",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Engineering,,4.034,"ALLIUM-SATIVUM,L.,LF-NMR,INTELLIGENT,DETECTION,MOISTURE-CONTENT,COLOR,CHANGES,MICROWAVE,WATER,QUALITY,KINETICS,ULTRASOUND",DRYING TECHNOLOGY,,

The proposed strategy provides a generic measure that describes the distortion score of local atomic environments. This score facilitates automatic defect localization and enables a stratified description of defects, which allows to distinguish the zones with different levels of distortion within the structure. This work proposes applications for advanced materials modelling ranging from the surrogate concept for the energy per atom to the relevant information selection for evaluation of energy barriers from the mean force. Moreover, this concept can serve for design of robust interatomic machine learning potentials and high-throughput analysis of their databases. The proposed definition of defects opens up many perspectives for materials design and characterization, promoting thereby the development of novel techniques in materials science.","OUTLIER DETECTION,NOVELTY DETECTION,SUPPORT,IMPURITIES,POTENTIALS",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"OUTLIER,DETECTION,NOVELTY,DETECTION,SUPPORT,IMPURITIES,POTENTIALS",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://zenodo.org/record/4133748/files/s41467-020-18282-2.pdf,

To this end, a database was compiled from the available literature, composed of 11 input variables. The input variables for predicting tensile strength of nanocomposites were selected for the following main reasons: (i) type of polymer matrix, (ii) mechanical properties of polymer matrix, (iii) physical characteristics of CNTs, (iv) mechanical properties of CNTs and (v) incorporation parameters such as CNT weight fraction, CNT surface modification method and processing method. As the problem of prediction is highly dimensional (with 11 dimensions), the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was selected and optimized by means of a parametric study. The correlation coefficient (R), Willmott's index of agreement (IA), slope of regression, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were employed as error measurement criteria when training the GPR model. The GPR model exhibited good performance for both training and testing parts (RMSE = 5.982 and 5.327 MPa, MAE = 3.447 and 3.539 MPa, respectively). In addition, uncertainty analysis was also applied to estimate the prediction confidence intervals. Finally, the prediction capability of the GPR model with different ranges of values of input variables was investigated and discussed. For practical application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed in Matlab for predicting the tensile strength of nanocomposites.","Carbon nanotubes,nanocomposites,machine learning,tensile strength,Gaussian process regression",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,2.552,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATIONS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,UNCERTAINTY,QUANTIFICATION,GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES,ELASTIC,PROPERTIES,INTERPHASE,BEHAVIOR,MODEL,NANOCOMPOSITES,FIBERS",JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS,,

But mostly, it has been focusing on the performance of the prediction modeling for disease-related entity, but not on the clinical implication of the feature itself. Here we analyzed liver imaging features of abdominal CT images collected from 2019 patients with stage I - III colorectal cancer (CRC) using convolutional neural network (CNN) to elucidate its clinical implication in oncological perspectives.ResultsCNN generated imaging features from the liver parenchyma. Dimension reduction was done for the features by principal component analysis. We designed multiple prediction models for 5-year metachronous liver metastasis (5YLM) using combinations of clinical variables (age, sex, T stage, N stage) and top principal components (PCs), with logistic regression classification. The model using ""1(st) PC (PC1) + clinical information"" had the highest performance (mean AUC=0.747) to predict 5YLM, compared to the model with clinical features alone (mean AUC=0.709). The PC1 was independently associated with 5YLM in multivariate analysis (beta=-3.831, P<0.001). For the 5-year mortality rate, PC1 did not contribute to an improvement to the model with clinical features alone. For the PC1, Kaplan-Meier plots showed a significant difference between PC1 low vs. high group. The 5YLM-free survival of low PC1 was 89.6% and the high PC1 was 95.9%. In addition, PC1 had a significant correlation with sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and fatty liver status.ConclusionThe imaging features combined with clinical information improved the performance compared to the standardized prediction model using only clinical information. The liver imaging features generated by CNN may have the potential to predict liver metastasis. These results suggest that even though there were no liver metastasis during the primary colectomy, the features of liver imaging can impose characteristics that could be predictive for metachronous liver metastasis.","Radiomics,Colorectal cancer,Convolutional neural network,Artificial intelligence",Article; Proceedings Paper,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"RESECTION,HETEROGENEITY,BIOMARKER,SURVIVAL",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-020-03686-0,

Emotion is commonly associated with logical decision making, perception, human interaction, and to a certain extent, human intelligence itself. With the growing interest of the research community towards establishing some meaningful ""emotional"" interactions between humans and computers, the need for reliable and deployable solutions for the identification of human emotional states is required. Recent developments in using electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition have garnered strong interest from the research community as the latest developments in consumer-grade wearable EEG solutions can provide a cheap, portable, and simple solution for identifying emotions. Since the last comprehensive review was conducted back from the years 2009 to 2016, this paper will update on the current progress of emotion recognition using EEG signals from 2016 to 2019. The focus on this state-of-the-art review focuses on the elements of emotion stimuli type and presentation approach, study size, EEG hardware, machine learning classifiers, and classification approach. From this state-of-the-art review, we suggest several future research opportunities including proposing a different approach in presenting the stimuli in the form of virtual reality (VR). To this end, an additional section devoted specifically to reviewing only VR studies within this research domain is presented as the motivation for this proposed new approach using VR as the stimuli presentation device. This review paper is intended to be useful for the research community working on emotion recognition using EEG signals as well as for those who are venturing into this field of research.","SELF-ASSESSMENT MANNEQUIN,MIXED REALITY,ARTIFACTS,SYSTEM,SIGNALS,BRAIN,CLASSIFICATION,DATABASE,REMOVAL,FACE",Review,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Mathematical & Computational Biology,Neurosciences & Neurology",,3.278,"SELF-ASSESSMENT,MANNEQUIN,MIXED,REALITY,ARTIFACTS,SYSTEM,SIGNALS,BRAIN,CLASSIFICATION,DATABASE,REMOVAL,FACE",COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,http://eprints.ums.edu.my/26384/2/EEG-Based%20Emotion%20Recognition%20A%20State-of-the-Art%20Review%20of%20Current%20Trends%20and%20Opportunities2.pdf,

At the same time, skin cancer is a commonly available type of cancer that exists all over the globe. This study projects a new segmentation based classification model for skin lesion diagnosis by combining a GrabCut algorithm and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy classifier (ANFC) model. The proposed method involves four main steps: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, the preprocessing step is carried out using a Top hat filter and inpainting technique. Then, the Grabcut algorithm is used to segment the preprocessed images. Next, the feature extraction process takes place by the use of a deep learning based Inception model. Finally, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier (ANFC) system gets executed to classify the dermoscopic images into different classes. The proposed model is simulated using a benchmark International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset and the results are examined interms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed model exhibits better identification and classification of skin cancer. For examining the effective outcome of the projected technique, an extensive comparison of the presented method with earlier models takes place.

An automatic extraction algorithm with the time-intensity curve (TIC) was proposed based on Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) in this study, and was applied to the framework of automatic analysis of cervical cancer tumors based on the deep belief networks, to assist doctors in the analysis of cervical cancer tumors. The framework was applied to the real clinical diagnostic data, and the feasibility of the method was verified by comparing the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Later, the parameters of patients' time to peak (TP), peak intensity (PI), mean transit time (MTT), and area under the curve (AUC) were obtained by drawing TICs, and the changes of p53 protein and ki-67 protein obtained by pathological section staining were analyzed to evaluate the therapeutic effect in the patients. It was found that the proposed model of tumor feature extraction based on the DBN had the higher accuracy (86.36%), sensitivity (83.33%), and specificity (87.50%). The related parameters of TIC curve obtained based on SNMF showed that there was a significant difference in p53 content between tissues with different degrees of disease (p < 0.05), the PI of poorly differentiated tissues was significantly higher than that of those with high to medium differentiation (p < 0.05). In addition, PI and AUC of patients after chemotherapy were significantly lower than that before chemotherapy (p < 0.05), while MTT was significantly higher than that before chemotherapy (p < 0.05). Therefore, the proposed TIC feature extraction of CEUS images based on SNMF and the automatic tumor classification based on deep learning can be used in the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of cervical cancer patients.","Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization,Deep belief networks,Time-intensity curve,Feature extraction,Cervical cancer",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.344,"CONTRAST,EXPRESSION,KI-67,P16",JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,,

Currently, the gold standard method requires incubation for 1824 h and subsequent inspection for growth by a trained medical technologist. We demonstrate an automated, cost-effective optical system that delivers early AST results, minimizing incubation time and eliminating human errors, while remaining compatible with standard phenotypic assay workflow. The system is composed of cost-effective components and eliminates the need for optomechanical scanning. A neural network processes the captured optical intensity information from an array of fiber optic cables to determine whether bacterial growth has occurred in each well of a 96-well microplate. When the system was blindly tested on isolates from 33 patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections, 95.03% of all the wells containing growth were correctly identified using our neural network with an average of 5.72 h of incubation time required to identify growth. Ninety percent of all wells (growth and no-growth) were correctly classified after 7 h, and 95% after 10.5 h. Our deep learning-based optical system met the FDA-defined criteria for essential and categorical agreements for all 14 antibiotics tested after an average of 6.13 and 6.98 h, respectively. Furthermore, our system met the FDA criteria for major and very major error rates for 11 of 12 possible drugs after an average of 4.02 h, and 9 of 13 possible drugs after an average of 9.39 h, respectively.

Bimetallic systems, in particular, often adopt very different compositions and morphologies at surfaces compared to the bulk. For the first time, we reveal a detailed atomistic picture of long-time scale restructuring of Pd deposited on Ag using microscopy, spectroscopy, and novel simulation methods. By developing and performing accelerated machine-learning molecular dynamics followed by an automated analysis method, we discover and characterize previously unidentified surface restructuring mechanisms in an unbiased fashion, including Pd-Ag place exchange and Ag pop-out as well as step ascent and descent. Remarkably, layer-by-layer dissolution of Pd into Ag is always preceded by an encapsulation of Pd islands by Ag, resulting in a significant migration of Ag out of the surface and a formation of extensive vacancy pits within a period of microseconds. These metastable structures are of vital catalytic importance, as Ag-encapsulated Pd remains much more accessible to reactants than bulk-dissolved Pd. Our approach is broadly applicable to complex multimetallic systems and enables the previously intractable mechanistic investigation of restructuring dynamics at atomic resolution.","ADSORBATE-INDUCED CHANGES,FINDING SADDLE-POINTS,SELECTIVE HYDROGENATION,CO ADSORPTION,PD,SEGREGATION,CATALYST,AU,REARRANGEMENT,ARCHITECTURE",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,15.801,"ADSORBATE-INDUCED,CHANGES,FINDING,SADDLE-POINTS,SELECTIVE,HYDROGENATION,CO,ADSORPTION,PD,SEGREGATION,CATALYST,AU,REARRANGEMENT,ARCHITECTURE",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/itempdf74155353254prod/11811660/Evolution_of_Metastable_Structures_at_Bimetallic_Surfaces_from_Microscopy_and_Machine-Learning_Molecular_Dynamics_v4.pdf,

Differing from previous works, this paper proposes a peak load shifting model to smooth the net load curve of an integrated electricity and natural gas system by coordinating the operations of the power-to-gas unit and generators. Moreover, the study aims to achieve multi-objective optimization while considering the economy of the system. A dynamic energy conversion and management strategy is proposed, which coordinates both the economic cost target and the peak load shifting target by adjusting an economic coefficient. To illustrate the complex energy conversion process, deep reinforcement learning is used to formulate the dynamic energy conversion and management problem as a discrete Markov decision process, and a deep deterministic policy gradient is adopted to solve the decision-making problem. By using the deep reinforcement learning method, the system operator can adaptively determine the conversion ratio of wind power, power-to-gas and gas turbine operations, and generator output through an online process, where the flexibility of wind power generation, wholesale gas price, and the uncertainties of energy demand are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can increase the profit of the system operator, reduce wind power curtailment, and smooth the net load curves effectively in real time.","Renewable energy accommodation,Dynamic energy conversion and management,Deep reinforcement learning",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Thermodynamics,Energy & Fuels,Mechanics",,8.954,"POWER-GENERATION,STORAGE,OPTIMIZATION,NETWORK",ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,,

Methods For each patient CT scan, our automated approach 1) segmented spinal canal using a convolutional-neural network (CNN), 2) formed sagittal and coronal intensity projection pairs, 3) labeled vertebral levels with X-Net, and 4) detected irregular intervertebral spacing using an analytic methodology. The spinal canal CNN was trained via fivefold cross validation using 1,966 simulation CT scans and evaluated on 330 CT scans. After labeling vertebral levels (S2-C1) in 897 palliative radiotherapy simulation CT scans, a volume of interest surrounding the spinal canal in each patient's CT scan was converted into sagittal and coronal intensity projection image pairs. Then, intensity projection image pairs were augmented and used to train X-Net to automatically label vertebral levels using fivefold cross validation (n = 803). Prior to testing upon the final test set (n = 94), CT scans of patients with anatomical abnormalities, surgical implants, or other atypical features from the final test set were placed in an outlier group (n = 20), whereas those without these features were placed in a normative group (n = 74). The performance of X-Net, X-Net Ensemble, and another leading vertebral labeling architecture (Btrfly Net) was evaluated on both groups using identification rate, localization error, and other metrics. The performance of our approach was also evaluated on the MICCAI 2014 test dataset (n = 60). Finally, a method to detect irregular intervertebral spacing was created based on the rate of change in spacing between predicted vertebral body locations and was also evaluated using the final test set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to investigate the performance of the method to detect irregular intervertebral spacing. Results The spinal canal architecture yielded centroid coordinates spanning S2-C1 with submillimeter accuracy (mean +/- standard deviation, 0.399 +/- 0.299 mm;n = 330 patients) and was robust in the localization of spinal canal centroid to surgical implants and widespread metastases. Cross-validation testing of X-Net for vertebral labeling revealed that the deep learning model performance (F(1)score, precision, and sensitivity) improved with CT scan length. The X-Net, X-Net Ensemble, and Btrfly Net mean identification rates and localization errors were 92.4% and 2.3 mm, 94.2% and 2.2 mm, and 90.5% and 3.4 mm, respectively, in the final test set and 96.7% and 2.2 mm, 96.9% and 2.0 mm, and 94.8% and 3.3 mm, respectively, within the normative group of the final test set. The X-Net Ensemble yielded the highest percentage of patients (94%) having all vertebral bodies identified correctly in the final test set when the three most inferior and superior vertebral bodies were excluded from the CT scan. The method used to detect labeling failures had 67% sensitivity and 95% specificity when combined with the X-Net Ensemble and flagged five of six patients with atypical vertebral counts (additional thoracic (T13), additional lumbar (L6) or only four lumbar vertebrae). Mean identification rate on the MICCAI 2014 dataset using an X-Net Ensemble was increased from 86.8% to 91.
3% through the use of transfer learning and obtained state-of-the-art results for various regions of the spine. Conclusions We trained X-Net, our unique convolutional neural network, to automatically label vertebral levels from S2 to C1 on palliative radiotherapy CT images and found that an ensemble of X-Net models had high vertebral body identification rate (94.2%) and small localization errors (2.2 +/- 1.8 mm). In addition, our transfer learning approach achieved state-of-the-art results on a well-known benchmark dataset with high identification rate (91.3%) and low localization error (3.3 mm +/- 2.7 mm). When we pre-screened radiotherapy CT images for the presence of hardware, surgical implants, or other anatomic abnormalities prior to the use of X-Net, it labeled the spine correctly in more than 97% of patients and 94% of patients when scans were not prescreened. Automatically generated labels are robust to widespread vertebral metastases and surgical implants and our method to detect labeling failures based on neighborhood intervertebral spacing can reliably identify patients with an additional lumbar or thoracic vertebral body.","automatic vertebral labeling,deep learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"RADIATION-THERAPY,BONE,SEGMENTATION,METASTASIS",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7756475,

With K-class problem exhaustively decomposed into all uniform binary partitions of K classes, EPHAH parallelly arranges the corresponding binary classifiers and aggregates their outputs to obtain the multi-class prediction using max-wins voting strategy. Based on orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) with feature selection using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, EPHAH is investigated by GC-MS urinary metabolomics data among healthy controls and 9 most common IMDs. The results show that EPHAH enables a complete learning of the complex multi-class decision boundaries of 10 classes, exhibiting significant superiority in classification accuracies over OAA, OAO and traditional HAH. Meanwhile, compared with OAO using the same max-wins voting strategy, EPHAH gives an effective break of the fie problem in classification and enhanced resolution in votes.","Metabolomics,Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs),Multi-class classification,Exhaustive and parallel half-against-half (EPHAH) decomposition,Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Automation & Control Systems,Chemistry,Computer Science,Instruments & Instrumentation,Mathematics",,3.839,"MS,URINARY,METABOLOMICS,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,INBORN-ERRORS,ORTHOGONAL,PROJECTIONS,IMPROVEMENT,TREE",CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS,,

This evolutionary field is mainly lead by wireless sensor network, radio frequency identification, and smart mobile technologies. Among others, the IoT plays a key role in the form of smart medical devices and wearables, with the ability to collect varied and longitudinal patient-generated health data, and at the same time also offering preliminary diagnosis options. In terms of efforts made for helping the patients using IoT-based solutions, experts exploit capabilities of the machine learning algorithms to provide efficient solutions in hemorrhage diagnosis. To reduce the death rates and propose accurate treatment, this paper presents a smart IoT-based application using machine learning algorithms for the human brain hemorrhage diagnosis. Based on the computerized tomography scan images for intracranial dataset, the support vector machine and feedforward neural network have been applied for the classification purposes. Overall, classification results of 80.67% and 86.7% are calculated for the support vector machine and feedforward neural network, respectively. It is concluded from the resultant analysis that the feedforward neural network outperforms in classifying intracranial images. The output generated from the classification tool gives information about the type of brain hemorrhage that ultimately helps in validating expert's diagnosis and is treated as a learning tool for trainee radiologists to minimize the errors in the available systems.","INFORMATION-CENTRIC INTERNET,MAC",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Mathematics,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,2.8,"INFORMATION-CENTRIC,INTERNET,MAC",COMPLEXITY,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3047869,

Additionally, the super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF) approach can further improve the imaging resolution of SDCM in 3D imaging at the cost of imaging time due to the large amounts of data acquisition and the increased risk of photo-bleaching and photo-toxicity due to the multiple excitations. Here, we propose a deep learning-based method for 3D SDCM, where the neighboring pixels in z-scanning slices are taken into account for 3D reconstruction. Consequently, high-quality imaging slices can be reconstructed directly from the SDCM stacks with a single scan. The image quality achievable with this SRRF-Deep method is comparable with the SRRF method, whereas it achieves image reconstruction about 30 times faster using 100 times fewer images. Thus, practicality of the SDCM system can be significantly improved in 3D imaging.","Three-dimensional displays,Microscopy,Training,Spatial resolution,Image reconstruction,Convolutional neural networks,confocal microscopy,super-resolution radial fluctuations",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Optics,Physics",,2.314,"FLUORESCENCE,MICROSCOPY",IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,,

Here we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the SMR sensor is uniquely suited for eddy current testing applications because both the coil and sensor utilize AC current as the excitation source. The use of SMR sensor effectively eliminates the necessity of any demodulation or lock-in technique for detecting the eddy current, which greatly simplifies the detection system. Furthermore, we show that the combination of principal component analysis and decision tree model is effective in classifying the metal cracks. The relatively clean signals obtained by the SMR sensor greatly facilitates the subsequent signal analysis and ensures high accuracy in the classification of different types of crack features.","Magnetic sensors,Eddy currents,Sensitivity,Probes,Anisotropic magnetoresistance,Eddy current testing,spin Hall magnetoresistance sensor,principal component analysis,decision tree model",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"DEFECT,DETECTION,SQUID",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04387,

In computational physics, chemistry and materials science, it can be as simple as making a scatter plot or as straightforward as looking through the snapshots of atomic positions manually. However, as a result of the ""big data"" revolution, these conventional approaches are often inadequate. The widespread adoption of high-throughput computation for materials discovery and the associated community-wide repositories have given rise to data sets that contain an enormous number of compounds and atomic configurations. A typical data set contains thousands to millions of atomic structures, along with a diverse range of properties such as formation energies, band gaps, or bioactivities.
It would thus be desirable to have a data-driven and automated framework for visualizing and analyzing such structural data sets. The key idea is to construct a low-dimensional representation of the data, which facilitates navigation, reveals underlying patterns, and helps to identify data points with unusual attributes. Such data-intensive maps, often employing machine learning methods, are appearing more and more frequently in the literature. However, to the wider community, it is not always transparent how these maps are made and how they should be interpreted. Furthermore, while these maps undoubtedly serve a decorative purpose in academic publications, it is not always apparent what extra information can be garnered from reading or making them.
This Account attempts to answer such questions. We start with a concise summary of the theory of representing chemical environments, followed by the introduction of a simple yet practical conceptual approach for generating structure maps in a generic and automated manner. Such analysis and mapping is made nearly effortless by employing the newly developed software tool ASAP. To showcase the applicability to a wide variety of systems in chemistry and materials science, we provide several illustrative examples, including crystalline and amorphous materials, interfaces, and organic molecules. In these examples, the maps not only help to sift through large data sets but also reveal hidden patterns that could be easily missed using conventional analyses.
The explosion in the amount of computed information in chemistry and materials science has made visualization into a science in itself. Not only have we benefited from exploiting these visualization methods in previous works, we also believe that the automated mapping of data sets will in turn stimulate further creativity and exploration, as well as ultimately feed back into future advances in the respective fields.",,Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,22.732,,ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6dedc85a-061b-407e-92c8-959efab91ec4/download_file?safe_filename=Cheng_et_al_2020_Mapping_materials_molecules.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article,

Current observational scales regard either only leg movement or discrete overall parameters, neglecting dysfunctions in the trunk and arms. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new multiple-cue observational scale, called the stroke mobility score (SMS).
Material/Methods: In a group of 131 patients, we developed a 1-page manual involving 6 subscores by Delphi method using the video-based SMS: trunk posture, leg movement of the most affected side, arm movement of the most affected side, walking speed, gait fluency and stability/risk of falling. Six medical raters then validated the SMS on a sample of 60 additional stroke patients. Conventional scales (NIHSS, Timed-Up-And-Go-Test, 10-Meter-Walk-Test, Berg Balance Scale, FIM-Item L, Barthel Index) were also applied.
Results: (1) High consistency and excellent inter-rater reliability of the SMS were verified (Cronbach's alpha >0.9). (2) The SMS subscores are non-redundant and reveal much more nuanced whole-body dysfunction details than conventional scores, although evident correlations as e.g. between 10-Meter-Walk-Test and subscore ""gait speed"" are verified. (3) The analysis of cross-correlations between SMS subscores unveils new functional interrelationships for stroke profiling.
Conclusions: The SMS proves to be an easy-to-use, tele-applicable, robust, consistent, reliable, and nuanced functional scale of gait impairments after stroke. Due to its sensitivity to whole-body motion criteria, it is ideally suited for machine learning algorithms and for development of new therapy strategies based on instrumented gait analysis.","Gait Disorders, Neurologic,Stroke,Symptom Assessment,Treatment Outcome",Article,"INT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION, INC, 150 BROADHOLLOW RD, STE 114, MELVILLE, NY 11747 USA",Research & Experimental Medicine,,2.637,"MEDICAL,DIAGNOSIS,BOTULINUM-TOXIN,REHABILITATION,WALKING,IMPROVEMENT,POSTURE",MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518021,

Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm-namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given similar to 10(4) or greater data points.

Instead, it allows to distinguish CT artifacts from real defects introduced in the production process. To this end, a three-step workflow was developed, in which any deviations from a reference part are detected and subsequently classified and segmented, to allow automatic decision whether the part fulfills given quality requirements.

Patients believe in the correct diagnosis of a deformity/defect improper functioning before the commencement of actual treatment. Presentation of imaging strategies makes ease in doctors' life. Now, they can provide satisfactory treatment to patients without performing hit and preliminary trials. The 2-Dimensional (2-D) imaging techniques give a clear idea of simple bone fractures but fail in visualising multiple fractures in a bone. 3-Dimensional (3-D) techniques overcome the challenges of 2-D imaging. In case of any injury such as fracture, arthritis, etc, doctor's mainly recommended Computerised Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the affected part for the correct diagnosis. Computed Tomography scan is a collection of multiple image slices of a target body part. These slices provide a fair idea of intra-articular fractures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging deals with soft tissues for the correct diagnosis of defects. Computed Tomography scan exposes a patient with high ionising radiations of X-Rays, which make a patient more prone to cancer. Moreover, Computerised Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are unaffordable for the economically weaker section of society due to their high cost. The drawback of 3-Dimaging techniques motivates researchers to develop a model that accept X-Ray image as an input and yields 3-D view at all possible angels from 0 degrees to 360 degrees for a fed image.
