Methods A literature review is conducted on the state-of-the-art techniques, which could be divided into five categories: (1) signal and image processing-based techniques to augment the needle, (2) modifications to the needle and insertion to help with needle-transducer alignment and visibility, (3) changes to ultrasound image formation, (4) motion-based analysis and (5) machine learning. Results Advantages, limitations and challenges of representative examples in each of the categories are discussed. Evaluation techniques performed in ex vivo, phantom and in vivo studies are discussed and summarized. Conclusion Greatest limitation of the majority of the literature is that they rely on original visibility of the needle in the static image. Need for additional/improved apparatus is the greatest limitation toward clinical utility in practice. Significance Ultrasound-guided needle placement is performed in many clinical applications, including biopsies, treatment injections and anesthesia. Despite the wide range and long history of this technique, an ongoing challenge is needle visibility in ultrasound. A robust technique to enhance ultrasonic needle visibility, especially for steeply inserted hand-held needles, and while maintaining clinical utility requirements is needed.","Needle detection,Ultrasound,Image-guidance,Machine learning,Needle visualization,Image processing",Review,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"TIP,LOCALIZATION,CURVILINEAR,ULTRASOUND,COLOR,DOPPLER,BIOPSY,TRACKING,VISIBILITY,GUIDANCE,SYSTEM,SEGMENTATION,STANDARD",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

A focus is on microstructure and temperature dependency of stresses and plastic strains in a structural panel under realistic loading conditions. Structural analysis is conducted using the recently developed uncertainty-quantified parametrically homogenized constitutive model (UQ-PHCM) for near-alpha Titanium alloys like Ti6242S. PHCMs exhibit explicit microstructural dependency and are developed from homogenization of crystal plasticity finite element simulation results with machine learning. Uncertainties due to model reduction, data sparsity and microstructural variability are accounted for in the model. Structural response with the UQ-PHCMs is compared to those predicted by isotropic elasticity and J(2) plasticity models without explicit microstructure information. Parametric studies illustrate how different uncertainties in the UQ-PHCM framework propagate to the structural response variables. The results also show the relative contribution of different microstructural features to the propagated uncertainty in structural response variables. The studies establish the UQ-PHCM as an effective tool for reliable structural analysis with consequences in material design.","Structural analysis,Microstructure-integrated constitutive relations,Parametric homogenization,Crystal plasticity,Titanium alloys,Uncertainty quantification",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Materials Science",,4.423,"POLYCRYSTALLINE,MICRO,STRUCTURES,STATISTICALLY,EQUIVALENT,RVES,PLASTICITY,FE,SIMULATIONS,FATIGUE-CRACK,NUCLEATION,RESPONSE,PREDICTION,AUTOMATED-ANALYSIS,PART,2,FRAMEWORK,PHCMS,PROPAGATION",INTEGRATING MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING INNOVATION,,

An important component of BCI, electroencephalography (EEG) is in general sensitive to noise and rich in all kinds of information from our brain. In this paper, we study the feature fusion problem in electroencephalography (EEG). We introduce (1) a discriminative feature extractor which can classify multi-labels from short-term EEG signals, and (2) a new strategy to filter out unwanted features from EEG signals based on our feature extractor. Filtering out signals relating to one property of the EEG signal while retaining another is similar to the way we can listen to just one voice during a party, which is known as the cocktail party problem in the machine learning area. Built based on the success of short-term EEG discriminative model, the feature filter is an end-to-end framework which is trained to map EEG signals with unwanted features directly to EEG signals without those features. Our experimental results on an alcoholism dataset show that our novel model can filter out over 90% of alcoholism information on average from EEG signals, with an average of only 4.2% useful feature accuracy lost, showing effectiveness for our proposed task.

Acquiring MR images is a slow process and acquiring multi scans of the same cross section for multi-echo imaging is even slower. In order to accelerate the scan, compressed sensing (CS) based techniques have been advocating partial K-space (Fourier domain) scans; the resulting images are reconstructed via structured CS algorithms. In recent times, it has been shown that instead of using off-the-shelf CS, better results can be obtained by adaptive reconstruction algorithms based on structured dictionary learning.

However, it remains a challenging problem due to the nucleus occlusion or overlapping, shape variation, and image background complexity. Recently, deep learning techniques are widely used in analyzing digital histopathology. We present a computerized image-based method for automatically segmenting nuclei using an integration of a deep learning model and an improved concave point detection algorithm. A modified atrous spatial pyramid pooling U-Net (ASPPU-Net) is derived to capture multi-scale nuclei features and obtain nuclei context information without reducing the spatial resolution of feature map. A weighted binary cross entropy loss function with Dice loss function is used to better handle the data unbalance problem. An accelerated concave point detection method allows to effectively and accurately segmenting highly overlapping nuclei. Our ASPPU-Net based method was tested on four independent data cohorts and achieved the highest Dice similarity coefficient of 0.83, and pixel wise accuracy of 0.95.

Text mining refers to the process of extracting interesting and significant patterns or knowledge from text documents. YouTube is known for its free provision of video sharing service. The content of YouTube videos may sometimes comprise of images or sequence(s) of images with unwanted material, such as aggression, which is the reason of emergence of many social problems, particularly among children such as demonstration of aggressive behavior and bullying at home, school and public places. The research work reports performance of machine learning classifiers that were applied on video transcripts of YouTube videos to detect aggression.

Various experiments were performed on the dataset using different machine learning (ML) classifiers with different text preprocessing settings in RapidMiner and Python environments and thus predictive classifier models were constructed and tested. In RapidMiner environment, the SVM classifier model outperformed the other classifiers achieving highest accuracy of 79% after preprocessing step of removal of stop words. In Python programming environment, NB classifier outperformed the other classifiers in majority of experiments with different preprocessing settings, achieving highest accuracy of 82.5%, when stemming was performed in preprocessing stage along with other preprocessing steps.

It is computationally exhaustive to identify molecular conformations and arrangements in organic molecular crystals due to complexity in intra- and inter-molecular interactions.

In particular, we focus on aromatic systems which are important for organic semiconductor materials. In this study, we aim to estimate the ellipsoidal molecular shapes of such crystals and predict them from single molecular descriptors. First, we identify the molecular crystals with molecular centroid arrangements that correspond to affine transformations of four basic cubic lattices, through topological analysis of the dataset of crystalline polycyclic aromatic molecules. The novelty of our method is that the topological data analysis is applied to arrangements of molecular centroids intead of those of atoms. For each of the identified crystals, we estimate the intracrystalline molecular shape based on the ellipsoid packing assumption.

Methods The proposed method achieves high-speed T(2)mapping by highly sparsely sampling (k, TE)-space. Image reconstruction from the undersampled data was done by exploiting the low-rank structure and sparsity in the T-2-weighted image sequence and image priors learned from training data. The image priors for a single TE were generated from the public Human Connectome Project data using a tissue-based deep learning method; the image priors were then transferred to other TEs using a generalized series-based method. With these image priors, the proposed reconstruction method used a low-rank model and a sparse model to capture subject-dependent novel features. Results The proposed method was evaluated using experimental data obtained from both healthy subjects and tumor patients using a turbo spin-echo sequence. High-quality T(2)maps at the resolution of 0.9 x 0.9 x 3.0 mm(3)were obtained successfully from highly undersampled data with an acceleration factor of 8.

Before the conceptualization of data lakes, former big data management platforms in the research fields of computational biology and biomedicine could not deal with many practical data management tasks very well. As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied, and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modeling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multimodal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, and sampling size. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multisided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.","data lake,DIKW,biological resources,unstructured data,XAI,explainability,interpretability",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,INFORMATION,FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552915,

Researchers usually use image-processing algorithms to extract material features from that and then characterise the material microstructure.

To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model. We evaluate our method on Al-La alloy microscopic images, which indicates that our method can achieve promising performance on inpainted and material microstructure characterisation results compared to other image inpainting software for both accuracy and time consumption. Lay Description A basic goal of materials data analysis is to extract useful information from materials datasets that can in turn be used to establish connections along the composition-processing-structure-properties chain. The microscopic images obtained by a microscope is the key carrier of material microstructural information. Researchers usually use image analysis algorithms to extract regions of interest or useful features from microscopic images, aiming to analyse material microstructure, organ tissues or device quality etc. Therefore, the integrity and clarity of the microscopic image are the most important attributes for image feature extraction. Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop various technologies to obtain perfect microscopic images. However, in practice, some extrinsic defects are often introduced during the preparation and/or shooting processes, and the elimination of these defects often requires mass efforts and cost, or even is impossible at present. Take the microstructure image of metallic material for example, samples prepared to microstructure characterisation often need to go through several steps such as cutting, grinding with sandpaper, polishing, etching, and cleaning. During the grinding and polishing process, defects such as scratches could be introduced. During the etching and cleaning process, some defects such as rust caused by substandard etching, stains etc. may arise and be persisted. These defects can be treated as damaged regions with nonfixed positions, different sizes, and random shapes, resulting in the loss of information, which seriously affects subsequent visual observation and microstructural feature extraction. To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model.

This study describes the application of computer vision system to capture leather surface images and use of a novel Fast Convergence Particle Swarm Optimization (FCPSO) algorithm on a set of handcrafted texture features viz., GLCM and classified using supervised classifiers viz., Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), SVM, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF).

Segmentation efficiency of the proposed FCPSO algorithm is evaluated and its performance is compared with other optimization algorithms. Efficiency of the segmentation algorithms is evaluated using performance measures such as average difference (AD), Area Error Rate (AER), Edge-based structural similarity index (ESSIM), F-Score, Normalized correlation coefficient (NK), Overlap Error (OE), structural content (SC), Structural similarity index (SSIM) and Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI). Correlation of the segmented area using FCPSO with the experts' ground truth is found to be high with R value of 0.84. Feature extraction is carried out using GLCM texture features and the most prominent features were selected using statistical t-test and correlation coefficient.

However, the widespread application of this data-driven technology is still challenged by the requirement of large training data, poor model interpretability, and hard-to-detect errors that undermine the soundness of conclusion. Here, we performed a systematic study for the modeling of the formation energies of inorganic compounds using deep learning. Our results proved the advantage of deep learning methods over several non-deep learning methods in this specific task and demonstrated the abstraction of knowledge using deep learning, which was a unique ability compared to non-deep learning methods. Several aspects that critically affected the conclusion were also highlighted, including the importance to rigorously compare model performance with the same dataset, the design of input representation, and the careful selection of model architecture. Findings from the current study demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning solving complicated problems in materials research and serve as new guidelines for future practicing of deep learning in this field.

Past studies have proven the feasibility of using vibrational measurements to detect damage but have not explored the full capabilities and limitations of vibrational testing. Here, we use a finite element model of a composite plate to characterize the natural frequency, mode shape, and mode curvature tests for a variety of delamination scenarios. We find that the mode curvature test is resource-intensive to conduct but provides the best resolution in both identifying and localizing delamination. On the other hand, the natural frequency test is simple and inexpensive to conduct but can only reliably identify the presence of delamination. Additionally, a machine learning model is implemented to augment the natural frequency test, allowing both localization of damage and quantification of its severity with only the natural frequencies of modes 1-6. We are able to interpret our model and discover a phase transition for natural frequencies with different sized delaminations. This testing framework allows rapid non-destructive analysis for the iterative design of composites, accelerating the development of novel delamination-resistant materials.

However, further progress in ORR activity requires evaluation of precursors and synthesis approaches. In response to this challenge, we generated a first of its kind experimental data set of 36 samples using high-throughput synthesis and activity measurements. Several control parameters (e.g., Fe precursor identity, the precursor content, and pyrolysis temperature) were varied. We then developed several state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based regression models to predict ORR activity, dependent on selected synthesis variables. Through an iterative algorithm, higher prediction accuracy (smaller root-mean-square error) was achieved. We identified that gradient boosting regression (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR), among several methods, work best for this data set. Aided by our ML-based surrogate models, we decided to alter catalyst synthesis conditions, which resulted in a 36% increase in measured ORR activity in comparison to the maximum ORR mass activity value of 21.9 A/g(catalyst) in the original data set.

However, fully automatic LV segmentation remains challenging due to the complex structure of cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) and the morphological changes of LV caused by various cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) for LV segmentation. Our network consists of two interactive subnetworks which utilize essentially identical but formally different labels in the hope that they can learn segmentation from different perspectives. The two subnetworks take the same cardiac MRI as input and output a pair of segmentation maps in different forms. After averaging the two segmentation maps obtained from the two subnetworks, we get the final contours of the endocardium (endo) and epicardium (epi) simultaneously. The proposed method is evaluated on the dataset provided by the Left Ventricle Full Quantification Challenge of MICCAI 2019. The average Dice scores on epi, endo, and myocardium (myo) reach 0.961, 0.949, and 0.867 respectively which outperform the other methods.

Deep learning-based diagnosis of nodules in lung CT images, however, is time-consuming and less accurate due to redundant structure and the lack of adequate training data. In this paper, a novel diagnosis method based on Deep Transfer Convolutional Neural Network (DTCNN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is explored, which merges the synergy of two algorithms to deal with benign-malignant nodules classification. An optimal DTCNN is first adopted to extract high-level features of lung nodules, which has been trained with the ImageNet dataset beforehand. After that, an ELM classifier is further developed to classify benign and malignant lung nodules. Two datasets, including the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) public dataset and a private dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China (FAH-GMU), have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Most traditional TOuU methods use gradient-based optimization algorithms and rely on accurate estimates of the statistical moments and their gradients, e.g., via adjoint calculations. When the number of uncertain inputs is large or the quantities of interest exhibit large variability, a large number of adjoint (and/or forward) solves may be required to ensure the accuracy of these gradients. The optimization procedure itself often requires a large number of iterations, which may render TOuU computationally expensive, if not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we here propose an optimization approach that generates a stochastic approximation of the objective, constraints, and their gradients via a small number of adjoint (and/or forward) solves, per optimization iteration. A statistically independent (stochastic) approximation of these quantities is generated at each optimization iteration. The total cost of this approach is only a small factor larger than that of the corresponding deterministic topology optimization problem. We incorporate the stochastic approximation of objective, constraints, and their design sensitivities into two classes of optimization algorithms. First, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and a number of its variants, which have been successfully applied to large-scale optimization problems for machine learning. Second, we study the use of the proposed stochastic approximation approach within conventional nonlinear programming methods, focusing on the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA). The performance of these algorithms is investigated with structural design optimization problems utilizing a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP), as well as an explicit level set method. These investigations, conducted on both two- and three-dimensional structures, illustrate the efficacy of the proposed stochastic gradient approach for TOuU applications.","Topology Optimization,Optimization under Uncertainty,Robust Design,Stochastic Gradient,Adam,AdaGrad",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Computer Science,Engineering,Mechanics",,4.715,"GEOMETRIC,UNCERTAINTIES,STRUCTURAL,OPTIMIZATION,SHAPE,MINIMIZATION,FILTERS,DESIGN",STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04562,

Here, we challenge the Molecular Transformer model to predict reactions on carbohydrates where regio- and stereoselectivity are notoriously difficult to predict. We show that transfer learning of the general patent reaction model with a small set of carbohydrate reactions produces a specialized model returning predictions for carbohydrate reactions with remarkable accuracy. We validate these predictions experimentally with the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide involving regioselective protections and stereoselective glycosylations. The transfer learning approach should be applicable to any reaction class of interest. Organic reactions can readily be learned by deep learning models, however, stereochemistry is still a challenge.

Recently, researchers have focused on using fast approaches, such as machine learning, to approximate brain deformation in real time for early brain injury diagnosis. However, training such models requires large number of kinematic measurements, and therefore data augmentation is required given the limited on-field measured data available. In this study we present a principal component analysis-based method that emulates an empirical low-rank substitution for head impact kinematics, while requiring low computational cost. In characterizing our existing data set of 537 head impacts, each consisting of 6 degrees of freedom measurements, we found that only a few modes, e.g., 15 in the case of angular velocity, is sufficient for accurate reconstruction of the entire data set. Furthermore, these modes are predominantly low frequency since over 70% of the angular velocity response can be captured by modes that have frequencies under 40 Hz. We compared our proposed method against existing impact parametrization methods and showed significantly better performance in injury prediction using a range of kinematic-based metrics-such as head injury criterion (HIC), rotational injury criterion (RIC), and brain injury metric (BrIC)-and brain tissue deformation-based metrics-such as brain angle metric (BAM), maximum principal strain (MPS), and axonal fiber strains (FS). In all cases, our approach reproduced injury metrics similar to the ground truth measurements with no significant difference, whereas the existing methods obtained significantly different (p< 0.01) values as well as substantial differences in injury classification sensitivity and specificity. This emulator will enable us to provide the necessary data augmentation to build a head impact kinematic data set of any size.

The cerebral perfusion values were compared by permutation test to identify brain regions with significant perfusion changes among 18 controls, 40 HIE/MRI circle minus patients, and 15 HIE/MRI circle plus patients. A machine learning model was developed to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes using the averaged perfusion in those identified brain regions. Results:Significantly decreased PASL perfusion in HIE/MRI circle minus group, when compared with controls, were found in the anterior corona radiata, caudate, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus. Both significantly increased and decreased cerebral perfusion changes were detected in HIE/MRI circle plus group, when compared with HIE/MRI circle minus group. There were no significant perfusion differences in the cerebellum, brainstem and deep structures of thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus among the three groups. The machine learning model demonstrated significant correlation (p< 0.05) in predicting language(r= 0.48) and motor(r= 0.57) outcomes in HIE/MRI circle minus patients, and predicting language(r= 0.76), and motor(r= 0.53) outcomes in an additional group combining HIE/MRI circle minus and HIE/MRI circle plus. Conclusion:Perfusion MRI can play an essential role in detecting HIE regardless of findings on conventional MRI and predicting language and motor outcomes in HIE survivors. The perfusion changes may also reveal important insights into the reperfusion response and intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms. Our results suggest that perfusion imaging may be a useful adjunct to conventional MRI in the evaluation of HIE in clinical practice.","arterial spin labeling,hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy,neonate,perfusion imaging,perfusion weighted imaging (PWI)",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Pediatrics,,3.607,"BRAIN-INJURY,BLOOD-FLOW,MRI,NEWBORNS,AGE",FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546822,

It is unknown if the structural and functional connections to the damaged area implicate the integrity of the cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present study examines the feasibility of measuring hemodynamic activity in the PFC in response to the structure of practice and during treatment. This multiple-baseline single case-design study involving two individuals with chronic acquired apraxia of speech measured the hemodynamic changes in PFC activity during treatment across the intervention period using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Two models-a generalized linear model and a spatial varying coefficient model-are used to distinguish the repeated measures of PFC activity differences corresponding to the stage of practice and time of intervention. There were significant differences in the pattern of PFC activity associated with the structure of practice and the time of intervention. The outcomes from this pilot study demonstrate the utility of fNIRS to identify cognitive effort during speech motor learning. The implications include consideration for statistical methods used for fNIRS analysis and its potential use as a clinical tool to complement behavior changes to guide patient-directed intervention to optimize patient outcomes.,"fNIRS,prefrontal cortex activity,generalized linear model,spatial varying,Moran statistics,apraxia of speech",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Mathematics,,,"NEAR-INFRARED,SPECTROSCOPY,ACQUIRED,APRAXIA,METAANALYTIC,EVIDENCE,INTERVENTION,RESEARCH,TREATMENT,GUIDELINES,GUIDED,TREATMENT,CONTROL,NETWORK,NIRS,FMRI",FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2020.00032/pdf,

However, this large degree of freedom has hindered the deterministic design of disordered systems for target functionalities. Here, we employ a machine learning approach for predicting and designing wave-matter interactions in disordered structures, thereby identifying scale-free properties for waves. To abstract and map the features of wave behaviors and disordered structures, we develop disorder-to-localization and localization-to-disorder convolutional neural networks, each of which enables the instantaneous prediction of wave localization in disordered structures and the instantaneous generation of disordered structures from given localizations. We demonstrate that the structural properties of the network architectures lead to the identification of scale-free disordered structures having heavy-tailed distributions, thus achieving multiple orders of magnitude improvement in robustness to accidental defects. Our results verify the critical role of neural network structures in determining machine-learning-generated real-space structures and their defect immunity. The performance of a trained neural network may be biased even by generic features of its architecture.

When a structure suffers from damage, it is necessary to implement maintenance programs for returning the structural performance and integrity to its initial normal condition. An important challenge is that the structure of interest may be damaged even after a sophisticated maintenance program. This conveys the great necessity of performing the second level of structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures. To achieve this aim, this article proposes a novel methodology using the concept of supervised learning. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to train various supervised learning classifiers using a training dataset that consists of features regarding both the undamaged and damaged states of the structure before the maintenance program in the first level. Once the classifiers have been trained, one attempts to predict the class labels of test samples associated with the current state of the structure after the maintenance program during the second level. According to the predefined class labels of the training and test samples in the first stage, it is feasible to recognize the current state of the maintained structure in the second level and detect potential damage. The major contribution of this article is to introduce the concept of supervised learning for damage detection in an innovative manner. A numerical concrete beam and an experimental laboratory frame are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results show that this methodology is a practical and reliable tool for structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures.","Structural health monitoring,Damage detection,Statistical pattern recognition,Supervised learning,Classification,Maintained civil structures",Article,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,1.476,"PRINCIPAL,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,DAMAGE,DETECTION,SENSITIVITY,DIAGNOSIS,MODELS",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,,

Here, we show through a machine learning analysis of nucleation simulations on a database of diverse model substrates that a set of physical descriptors for heterogeneous ice nucleation can be identified. Our results reveal that, beyond Vonnegut's connection with the lattice match to ice, three new microscopic factors help to predict the ice nucleating ability. These are: local ordering induced in liquid water, density reduction of liquid water near the surface and corrugation of the adsorption energy landscape felt by water. With this we take a step towards quantitative understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation and the in silico design of materials to control ice formation. Heterogenous ice nucleation is a ubiquitous phenomenon, but predicting the ice nucleation ability of a substrate is challenging.

Though, image segmentation using deep learning techniques is achieving remarkable results, it leverages on large-scale labeled datasets. But, in the field of medical imaging, it is challenging to acquire large labeled datasets. Hence, this article proposes a novel deep learning model to automatically segment the optic disc in retinal fundus images by using the concepts of semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. Initially, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is trained to automatically learn features from a large number of unlabeled fundus images available from the Kaggle's diabetic retinopathy (DR) dataset. The autoencoder (AE) learns the features from the unlabeled images by reconstructing the input images and becomes a pre-trained network (model). After this, the pre-trained autoencoder network is converted into a segmentation network. Later, using transfer learning, the segmentation network is trained with retinal fundus images along with their corresponding optic disc ground truth images from the DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets. The trained segmentation network is then tested on retinal fundus images from the test set of DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods achieving a 0.967 and 0.902 dice score coefficient on the test set of the DRISHTI GS1 and RIM-ONE datasets respectively. The proposed method also shows that transfer learning and semi-supervised learning overcomes the barrier imposed by the large labeled dataset. The proposed segmentation model can be used in automatic retinal image processing systems for diagnosing diseases of the eye.","Deep learning,Autoencoder,Semi-supervised learning,Convolutional neural network,Transfer learning,Segmentation,Optic disc",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,CUP,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

In this study, we propose the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and automated deep learning to non-invasively evaluate hair and follicle counts that may be used to monitor the success of hair growth therapy more accurately and efficiently. Study Design/Materials and Methods We collected 70 OCT scans from 14 patients with alopecia and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically count all follicles present in the scans. The model is based on a dual approach of both detecting hair follicles and estimating the local hair density in order to give accurate counts even for cases where two or more adjacent hairs are in close proximity to each other. Results We evaluate our system on 70 OCT manually labeled scans taken at different scalp locations from 14 patients, with 20 of those redundantly labeled by two human expert OCT operators. When comparing the individual human predictions and considering the exact locations of hair and follicle predictions, we find that the two human raters disagree with each other on approximately 22% of hairs and follicles. Overall, the deep learning (DL) system predicts the number of follicles with an error rate of 11.8% and the number of hairs with an error rate of 18.7% on average on the 70 scans. The OCT system can capture one scalp location in three seconds, and the DL model can make all predictions in less than a second after processing the scan, which takes half a minute using an unoptimized implementation.

Retinal blood vessels are the most easily visible vessels in the whole body, and therefore, play a key role in the diagnosis of numerous diseases and eye disorders. Systematic and eye diseases cause morphologic variations, such as the growing, narrowing or branching of retinal blood vessels. Imaging-based screening of retinal blood vessels plays an important role in the identification and follow-up of eye diseases. Therefore, automatic retinal vessel segmentation can be used to diagnose and monitor those diseases. Computer-aided algorithms are required for the analysis of progression of eye diseases. This study proposes a hybrid method that provides a combination of pre-processing and data augmentation methods with a deep learning model. Pre-processing was used to solve the irregular clarification problems and to form a contrast between the background and retinal blood vessels. After pre-processing step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and then trained for the extraction of retinal blood vessels. In the training phase, data augmentation was performed to improve training performance. The CNN was trained and tested in the DRIVE database, which is commonly used in retinal blood vessel segmentation and publicly available for studies in this area. Results showed that the proposed system extracted vessels with a sensitivity of 77.78%, specificity of 97,84%, precision of 84.17% and accuracy of 95.27%.

The recent advancements in deep learning techniques increase the computational powers to extract vital features without human intervention. The automatic detection and segmentation of subtle tissue such as the internal auditory canal (IAC) and its nerves is a challenging task, and it can be improved using deep learning techniques. Methods The main scope of this research is to present an automatic method to detect and segment the IAC and its nerves like the facial nerve, cochlear nerve, inferior vestibular nerve, and superior vestibular nerve. To address this issue, we propose a Mask R-CNN approach driven with U-net to detect and segment the IAC and its nerves. The Mask R-CNN with its backbone network of the RESNET50 model learns a background-based localization policy to produce an actual bounding box of the IAC. Furthermore, the U-net segments the structure related information of IAC and its nerves by learning its features. Results The proposed method was experimented on clinical datasets of 50 different patients including adults and children. The localization of IAC using Mask R-CNN was evaluated using Intersection of Union (IoU), and segmentation of IAC and its nerves was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient. Conclusions The localization result shows that mean IoU of RESNET50, RESNET101 are 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. The Dice similarity coefficient of IAC and its nerves using region growing, PSO and U-net method scored 92%, 94%, and 96%, respectively. The result shows that the proposed method outperform better in localization and segmentation of IAC and its nerves. Thus, AI aids the radiologists in making the right decisions as the localization and segmentation of IAC is accurate.","Mask R-CNN,U-net,Localization,Segmentation,Internal auditory canal",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,U-NET,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

An aspect of this process can be recreatedin vitroby embedding fibroblasts into a collagen matrix and providing a fibrotic stimulus. This work expands upon a previously described method to print microscale cell-laden collagen gels and combines it with live cell imaging and automated image analysis to enable high-throughput analysis of the kinetics of cell-mediated contraction of this collagen matrix. The image analysis method utilizes a plugin for FIJI, built around Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) Segmentation. After cross-validation of this automated image analysis with manual shape tracing, the assay was applied to primary human lung fibroblasts including cells isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. In the absence of any exogenous stimuli, the analysis showed significantly faster and more extensive contraction of the diseased cells compared to the healthy ones. Upon stimulation with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), fibroblasts from the healthy donor showed significantly more contraction throughout the observation period while differences in the response of diseased cells was subtle and could only be detected during a smaller window of time. Finally, dose-response curves for the inhibition of collagen gel contraction were determined for 3 small molecules including the only 2 FDA-approved drugs for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","pulmonary fibrosis,collagen contraction,fibroblasts,phenotypic assay,aqueous two-phase systems,machine learning",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"IDIOPATHIC,PULMONARY-FIBROSIS,PIRFENIDONE,INSIGHTS",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537788,

Nevertheless, our understanding of the melt crystallization mechanism remains poor. This is because the molecular-scale structures of melts are difficult to clarify experimentally. Computer simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD), are often used to investigate melt structures. However, the time evolution of the structural order in a melt during crystallization must be analyzed properly. In this study, dimensional reduction (DR), which is an unsupervised machine learning technique, is used to evaluate the time evolution of structural order. The DR is performed for high-dimensional data representing an atom-atom pair distribution function and the distribution function of the angle formed by three nearest neighboring atoms at each period during crystallization, which are obtained by an MD simulation of a supercooled Lennard-Jones melt. The results indicate that crystallization occurs via the following activation processes: nucleation of a crystal with a distorted structure and reconstruction of the crystal to a more stable structure. The time evolution of the local structures during crystallization is also evaluated with this method. The present method can be applied to studies of the mechanism of crystallization from a disordered system for real materials, even for complicated multicomponent materials.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION,CALCIUM-CARBONATE,CLATHRATE HYDRATE,GROWTH-KINETICS,MAGNESIUM-IONS,EQUILIBRIUM,INTERFACES,ANISOTROPY,SURFACE,WATER",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATION,CALCIUM-CARBONATE,CLATHRATE,HYDRATE,GROWTH-KINETICS,MAGNESIUM-IONS,EQUILIBRIUM,INTERFACES,ANISOTROPY,SURFACE,WATER",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508891,

The objective of this study was to construct a procedural planning tool to optimize the proximal junction angle (PJA) to prevent postoperative proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) for each scoliosis patient. Methods. Twelve patients (9 patients without PJK and 3 patients with PJK) who have been followed up for at least 2 years after surgery were included. After calculating the loading force on the cephalad intervertebral disc of upper instrumented vertebra of each patient, the finite-element method (FEM) was performed to calculate the stress of each element. The stress information was summarized into the difference value before and after operation in different regions of interest. A two-layer fully connected neural network method was applied to model the relationship between the stress information and the risk of PJK. Leave-one-out cross-validation and sensitivity analysis were implemented to assess the accuracy and stability of the trained model. The optimal PJA was predicted based on the learned model by optimization algorithm.Results. The mean prediction accuracy was 83.3% for all these cases, and the area under the curve (AUC) of prediction was 0.889.

In recent years, many of the bimetallic alloy catalysts with (100) as the predominant facet have shown outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, alloying effects on the activity at (100) were less explored, compared to the well-studied close-packed surfaces. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the catalytic activity of bimetallic alloy (100) surfaces for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The ensemble and compositional effects of (100) facets alloyed by strong- (Pd and Pt) and weak-binding (Ag, Au, and Cu) transition metals were studied. Based on DFT calculations, the catalytic activities of bimetallic alloys for the HER were systematically investigated using H binding energy as the reaction descriptor, at all of the typical surface ensembles on (100). Our results suggest that PdxAg1-x and PdxAu1-x(100) have promising theoretical HER activity in acidic media, due to the presence of highly active four-fold ensembles which reach the peak of the HER volcano activity plot. The electronic structure and stability of the alloys with predicted promising HER activities were studied. Furthermore, based on the DFT-calculated database, we performed feature analysis and developed a machine learning model which can help to predict HER activities of those out-of-sample alloys. Most importantly, this study provides helpful guidelines for the design of (100) dominated bimetallic alloys towards promising HER activity.","TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,ELECTROCATALYTIC MATERIALS,NANOPARTICLES,ADSORPTION,REDUCTION,ENSEMBLE,LIGAND,NANOCRYSTALS,ACTIVATION,NANOSHEETS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Energy & Fuels,Materials Science",,11.995,"TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,ELECTROCATALYTIC,MATERIALS,NANOPARTICLES,ADSORPTION,REDUCTION,ENSEMBLE,LIGAND,NANOCRYSTALS,ACTIVATION,NANOSHEETS",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A,,

Various studies have shown a significant dependence of the welding quality on the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. Frequently, an inappropriate setting of these parameters can be detected through an examination of the resulting surface defects, such as increased flash formation or surface galling. In this work, two different learning-based algorithms were applied to improve the surface topography of friction stir welds. For this purpose, the surface topographies of 262 welds, which were performed as part of ten studies, were evaluated offline. The aim was to use reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization approaches to determine the most appropriate settings for the welding speed and the rotational speed of the tool. The optimization problem was solved using reinforcement learning, specifically value iteration. However, the value iteration algorithm was not efficient, since all actions and states had to be iterated over, i.e., each possible parameter combination had to be evaluated, to find the best policy. Instead, it was better to solve the optimization problem directly using the Bayesian optimization. Two approaches were applied: both an approach in which the information from the other studies was not used and an approach in which the information from the other studies was used. On average, both the Bayesian optimization approaches found suitable welding parameters significantly faster than a random search algorithm, and the latter approach improved the result even further compared with the former approach. Future research will aim to show that optimization of the surface topography also leads to an increase in the ultimate tensile strength.","Artificial intelligence,Friction stir welding,Reinforcement learning,Bayesian optimization,Surface quality",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,PARAMETERS,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00170-020-05696-x.pdf,

In this study, we constructed magnetic resonance (MR) image-based finite element (FE) models of a mouse brain for simulations of controlled cortical impact. The anatomical details were kept by mapping each image voxel to a corresponding FE mesh element.

This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of noise reduction for tracers without sufficient training datasets using a deep transfer learning approach, which can utilize existing networks trained by the widely available FDG datasets. In this study, the deep transfer learning strategy based on a fully 3D patch-based U-Net was investigated on a(18)F-fluoromisonidazole (F-18-FMISO) dataset using single-bed scanning and a(68)Ga-DOTATATE dataset using whole-body scanning. The datasets of(18)F-FDG by single-bed scanning and whole-body scanning were used to obtain pre-trained U-Nets separately for subsequent cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning. The full-dose PET images were used as the labels while low-dose PET images from 10% counts were used as the inputs. Three types of U-Nets were obtained: a U-Net trained by FDG dataset, a pre-trained FDG U-Net fine-tuned by another less-available tracer (FMISO/DOATATE), and a U-Net completely trained by a large number of less-available tracer datasets (FMISO/DOATATE), used as the reference U-Net. The denoising performance of the three types of U-Nets was evaluated on single-bed(18)F-FMISO and whole-body(68)Ga-DOTATATE separately and compared using normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and relative bias of region of interest (ROI). For cross-tracer transfer learning, all the U-Nets provided denoised images with similar quality for both tracers. There was no significant difference in terms of NRMSE and SNR when comparing the former two U-Nets with the reference U-Net. The ROI biases for these U-Nets were similar. For cross-tracer and cross-protocol transfer learning, the pre-trained single-bed FDG U-Net fine-tuned by whole-body DOTATATE data provided the most consistent images with the reference U-Net. Fine-tuning significantly reduced the NRMSE and the ROI bias and improved the SNR when comparing the fine-tuned U-Net with the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG only (NRMSE: 96.3% +/- 21.1% versus 120.6% +/- 18.5%, ROI bias: -10.5% +/- 13.0% versus -14.7% +/- 6.4%, SNR: 4.2 +/- 1.4 versus 3.9 +/- 1.6, for fine-tuned U-Net and the U-Net trained by single-bed FDG, respectively, withp< 0.01 in all cases).

To improve the prediction accuracy of respiratory signals by adapting the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) model to changing respiratory signals. We have previously developed an MLP-NN to predict respiratory signals obtained from a real-time position management (RPM) device. Preliminary testing results indicated that poor prediction accuracy may be observed after several seconds for irregular breathing patterns as only a set of fixed data was used in one-time training. To improve the prediction accuracy, we introduced a continuous learning technique using the updated training data to replace one-time learning using the fixed training data. We carried on this new prediction using an adaptation approach with dual MLP-NNs rather than single MLP-NN. When one MLP-NN was performing prediction of the respiratory signals, another one was being trained using the updated data and vice versa. The predicted performance was evaluated by root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the predicted and true signals from 202 patients' respiratory patterns each with 1 min recording length. The effects of adding an additional network, training parameter, and respiratory signal irregularity on the performance of the new predictor were investigated based on four different network configurations: a single MLP-NN, high-computation dual MLP-NNs (U1), two different combinations of high- and low-computation dual MLP-NNs (U2 and U3). The RMSEs using U1 method were reduced by 34%, 19%, and 10% compared to those using MLP-NN, U2 and U3 methods, respectively.

Therefore, in this paper, effective bio-inspired machine learning techniques are utilized to predict the epilepsy seizure from the EEG signal with maximum recognition accuracy. Initially, patient brain images are collected by placing the electrodes on their scalp. From the brain signal, different features are extracted that are analyzed with the help of the Krill Herd algorithm for selecting the best features. The selected features are processed using an artificial alga optimized general Adversarial Networks. The network recognizes the intricate and abnormal seizure patterns. Then the discussed state-of-art methods are examined simulation results.","Brain informatics,Epilepsy,Electroencephalogram (EEG),Krill herd algorithm,Artificial alga optimized general adversarial networks",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,ALGORITHM,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

It spreads quickly at a frightening pace to all parts of the body and early detection of such diseases may help reduce the risks. Many methods have been used to classify and predict the outcome of cancer, such as image processing techniques, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. Out of these methods, artificial intelligence techniques have played an essential role and have provided satisfying results from different investigations in various fields. Considering that cancer is a genetic disease, electron-ion interaction pseudo potential can be used to convert DNA sequences from string shape into number values so that genomic signal processing can be applied for the feature extraction step. In this paper, 51 healthy and 51 cancer genes from multiple cells obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genbank were used for analysis. Then, 7 invariant moments were extracted into 2 types of learning machine methods: supervised and unsupervised learning. Finally, their results were compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic parameters. From these results, the best accuracy was obtained from the trainable cascade-forward backpropagation network.

We utilized the novel Breitung-Candelon spectral Granger-causality aka frequency domain causality and parameter stability tests to account for the direction of causality. These tests, a resemblance to machine learning algorithm were required to examine the sequential shock of unobserved features of series not reported in traditional Granger-causality tests. The empirical results found a short-run relationship between renewables and economic growth, suggesting a strong effect of wealth on renewable energy consumption. We confirmed a strong and long-term metallurgical coal-controlled metal footprint through steelmaking, and coal-driven energy-based economic structure. The feedback hypothesis was validated between biomass consumption and economic growth. There was evidence that metal ore consumption predicts economic growth, income level and renewable energy consumption while it causes ambient air pollution. From a policy perspective, the study demonstrates that the diversification of the energy mix with renewable energy sources will reduce fossil fuel footprint.","Spectral granger-causality test,Frequency domain causality test,Particulate matter,Air pollution",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,7.842,"NATURAL-RESOURCES,COAL,CONSUMPTION,GROWTH,EVIDENCE,AIR-POLLUTANTS,CHINA,EMISSIONS,METALS",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139602,

In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to the color fundus images for the automatic detection of glaucoma. Compared to the existing automatic screening methods, CNNs have the ability to extract the distinct features directly from the fundus images. In this paper, a deep learning architecture based on a CNN is designed for the classification of glaucomatous and normal fundus images. An 18-layer CNN is designed and trained to extract the discriminative features from the fundus image. It comprises of four convolutional layers, two max pooling layers, and one fully connected layer. A two-stage tuning approach is proposed for the selection of suitable batch size and initial learning rate. The proposed network is tested on DRISHTI-GS1, ORIGA, RIM-ONE2 (release 2), ACRIMA, and large-scale attention-based glaucoma (LAG) databases. Rotation data augmentation technique is employed to enlarge the dataset. Randomly selected 70% of images are used for training the model and remaining 30% images are used for testing. An overall accuracy of 86.62%, 85.97%, 78.32%, 94.43%, and 96.64% are obtained on DRISHTI-GS1, RIM-ONE2, ORIGA, LAG, and ACRIMA databases, respectively.

The use of machine vision technology to automatically detect the defects of products has become an indispensable means for better quality control.

In the proposed approach, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) that realizes fast defect detection while maintaining high accuracy is designed. Our proposed approach makes four contributions. First, we introduce the depthwise separable convolution to reduce the calculation time. Second, we improve the squeeze-and-excitation block to improve network performance. Third, we introduce the squeeze-and-expand mechanism to reduce the computation cost. Fourth, we employ a smoother activation function (Mish) to allow improved information flow. The proposed network is compared with the benchmark CNNs (including Inception, ResNet and MobileNet). The experimental results show that compared with the benchmark networks, our proposed network has achieved the best results regarding the accuracy and suboptimal results in terms of the speed compared with the benchmark networks.

The goal of this paper is to provide context for the application of machine learning to materials processing. The general landscapes of data science and materials processing are presented, using the foundry and the metal casting industry as an exemplar. The challenges that exist with typical foundry data are that the data are unbalanced, semi-supervised, heterogeneous, and limited in sample size. Data science methods to address these issues are presented and discussed. The elements of a data science project are outlined and illustrated by a case study using sand cast foundry data.

Identification of these defects has the potential to improve cell performance and reliability. The impact of bulk defects on minority carrier lifetime is commonly measured using temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy and the defect parameters, such as its energy level and capture cross-section ratio, are usually extracted by fitting the Shockley-Read-Hall equation. We propose an alternative extraction approach by using machine learning trained on more than a million simulated lifetime curves, achieving coefficient of determinations between the true and predicted values of the defect parameters above 99%. In particular, random forest regressors, show that defect energy levels can be predicted with a high precision of +/- 0.02 eV, 87% of the time. The traditional approach of fitting to the Shockley-Read-Hall equation usually yields two sets of defect parameters, one in each half bandgap. The machine learning model is trained to predict the half bandgap location of the energy level, and successfully overcome the traditional approach's limitation. The proposed approach is validated using experimental measurements, where the machine learning predicts defect energy level and capture cross-section ratio within the uncertainty range of the traditional fitting method.

This process is known to be both faster and more reliable as a form of identification and diagnosis. In this regard, the current study proposes an expert-designed system called COVIDetectioNet model, which utilizes features selected from combination of deep features for diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AlexNet architecture that employed the transfer learning approach, was used. The effective features that were selected using the Relief feature selection algorithm from all layers of the architecture were then classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.

Seven per cent of Indian diabetic population suffer from DME or damage to macula. The study proposes an integrated model to contribute to the prevention of loss of visual acuity. For detection of exudates and visualization of severity of DME image processing, machine learning and data analysis strategies are used. Methods Experimentation on Indian population is done using Indian Diabetic Eye Diseases Dataset (IDEDD), acquired from metropolitan region of Mumbai and publicly available Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD, Nanded) and a standard public database DIARETDB1- Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database. To negate the effect of increase in the dimensionality and overfitting of the dataset parameters, a tree-based forward search algorithm for optimal feature subset identification is proposed. This provides global insight of effect of the statistical and spatial features on model behaviour. Machine learning algorithms of random forest and support vector machine are used for classification. Results The sensitivity and specificity of 97.1% and 100% is achieved for IDEDD data. Severity grading is done using image processing for segmenting the vessel mesh, optic disk, and macula from the abnormal retinal scans for detecting clinically significant macular edema by visualizing exudates. The distance between optic disc-fovea (OF) and the ratio of distance (OF) to that of disc diameter is formulated for localization of macula. Region-based and distance-based grading methods for quantification of the severity and visualization are implemented.

Generally, in the Superpave design system asphalt binder is selected based on the binder PG grade required for the climate. However, to implement performance control through the traditional Superpave PG system during mix design faces more challenges due to the changes of oil refinery, asphalt binder modification, and the use of recycled materials in the mixture. This paper aims to investigate the role of asphalt binders and mix designs in the rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures. A total of 22 plant-produced mixtures from 10 states and 5 laboratory-produced mixtures were investigated for their rutting performance in this study. Those tested mixtures include various binder grades, aggregate sources, RAP contents, and mix designs. The Superpave binder rutting parameter G*/sin delta and Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery (MSCR) grade parameter Jnr3.2 are correlated with the mixture dynamic modulus and Hamburg Wheel Tracking (HWT) rutting parameters. In addition, the effects of other mix design variables on the rutting resistance are evaluated using a statistical analysis. The results show that by incorporating the binder properties and mix design variables, the stepwise regression fitting provides a much better prediction for HWT rutting parameters as compared to using only the binder properties. This indicates the importance of proper selection of the binder grade for mixture performance, and it also calls for justifying more focus on including mixture design variables to ensure acceptable mixture rutting performance. The statistical analysis can provide an insight into the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by generating mathematical models for evaluating which mixture design variables are needed for better prediction of rutting performance.","Rutting resistance,Hamburg Wheel Tracking,dynamic modulus,Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery,stepwise regression",Article; Early Access,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Materials Science",,3.858,"DYNAMIC,MODULUS,HMA",ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN,,

The input variables for predicting tensile strength of nanocomposites were selected for the following main reasons: (i) type of polymer matrix, (ii) mechanical properties of polymer matrix, (iii) physical characteristics of CNTs, (iv) mechanical properties of CNTs and (v) incorporation parameters such as CNT weight fraction, CNT surface modification method and processing method. As the problem of prediction is highly dimensional (with 11 dimensions), the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was selected and optimized by means of a parametric study. The correlation coefficient (R), Willmott's index of agreement (IA), slope of regression, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were employed as error measurement criteria when training the GPR model. The GPR model exhibited good performance for both training and testing parts (RMSE = 5.982 and 5.327 MPa, MAE = 3.447 and 3.539 MPa, respectively). In addition, uncertainty analysis was also applied to estimate the prediction confidence intervals.

But mostly, it has been focusing on the performance of the prediction modeling for disease-related entity, but not on the clinical implication of the feature itself. Here we analyzed liver imaging features of abdominal CT images collected from 2019 patients with stage I - III colorectal cancer (CRC) using convolutional neural network (CNN) to elucidate its clinical implication in oncological perspectives.ResultsCNN generated imaging features from the liver parenchyma. Dimension reduction was done for the features by principal component analysis. We designed multiple prediction models for 5-year metachronous liver metastasis (5YLM) using combinations of clinical variables (age, sex, T stage, N stage) and top principal components (PCs), with logistic regression classification. The model using ""1(st) PC (PC1) + clinical information"" had the highest performance (mean AUC=0.747) to predict 5YLM, compared to the model with clinical features alone (mean AUC=0.709). The PC1 was independently associated with 5YLM in multivariate analysis (beta=-3.831, P<0.001). For the 5-year mortality rate, PC1 did not contribute to an improvement to the model with clinical features alone. For the PC1, Kaplan-Meier plots showed a significant difference between PC1 low vs. high group. The 5YLM-free survival of low PC1 was 89.6% and the high PC1 was 95.9%. In addition, PC1 had a significant correlation with sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and fatty liver status.ConclusionThe imaging features combined with clinical information improved the performance compared to the standardized prediction model using only clinical information. The liver imaging features generated by CNN may have the potential to predict liver metastasis. These results suggest that even though there were no liver metastasis during the primary colectomy, the features of liver imaging can impose characteristics that could be predictive for metachronous liver metastasis.","Radiomics,Colorectal cancer,Convolutional neural network,Artificial intelligence",Article; Proceedings Paper,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"RESECTION,HETEROGENEITY,BIOMARKER,SURVIVAL",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-020-03686-0,

Emotion is commonly associated with logical decision making, perception, human interaction, and to a certain extent, human intelligence itself. With the growing interest of the research community towards establishing some meaningful ""emotional"" interactions between humans and computers, the need for reliable and deployable solutions for the identification of human emotional states is required. Recent developments in using electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition have garnered strong interest from the research community as the latest developments in consumer-grade wearable EEG solutions can provide a cheap, portable, and simple solution for identifying emotions. Since the last comprehensive review was conducted back from the years 2009 to 2016, this paper will update on the current progress of emotion recognition using EEG signals from 2016 to 2019. The focus on this state-of-the-art review focuses on the elements of emotion stimuli type and presentation approach, study size, EEG hardware, machine learning classifiers, and classification approach. From this state-of-the-art review, we suggest several future research opportunities including proposing a different approach in presenting the stimuli in the form of virtual reality (VR). To this end, an additional section devoted specifically to reviewing only VR studies within this research domain is presented as the motivation for this proposed new approach using VR as the stimuli presentation device. This review paper is intended to be useful for the research community working on emotion recognition using EEG signals as well as for those who are venturing into this field of research.","SELF-ASSESSMENT MANNEQUIN,MIXED REALITY,ARTIFACTS,SYSTEM,SIGNALS,BRAIN,CLASSIFICATION,DATABASE,REMOVAL,FACE",Review,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Mathematical & Computational Biology,Neurosciences & Neurology",,3.278,"SELF-ASSESSMENT,MANNEQUIN,MIXED,REALITY,ARTIFACTS,SYSTEM,SIGNALS,BRAIN,CLASSIFICATION,DATABASE,REMOVAL,FACE",COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,http://eprints.ums.edu.my/26384/1/EEG-Based%20Emotion%20Recognition%20A%20State-of-the-Art%20Review%20of%20Current%20Trends%20and%20Opportunities1.pdf,

At the same time, skin cancer is a commonly available type of cancer that exists all over the globe. This study projects a new segmentation based classification model for skin lesion diagnosis by combining a GrabCut algorithm and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy classifier (ANFC) model. The proposed method involves four main steps: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, the preprocessing step is carried out using a Top hat filter and inpainting technique. Then, the Grabcut algorithm is used to segment the preprocessed images. Next, the feature extraction process takes place by the use of a deep learning based Inception model. Finally, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier (ANFC) system gets executed to classify the dermoscopic images into different classes. The proposed model is simulated using a benchmark International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset and the results are examined interms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed model exhibits better identification and classification of skin cancer. For examining the effective outcome of the projected technique, an extensive comparison of the presented method with earlier models takes place. The experimental values indicated that the proposed method has offered a maximum sensitivity of 93.40%, specificity of 98.70% and accuracy of 97.91%.","IoMT,Skin lesion,Deep learning,Artifact removal,Feature extraction",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,"IMAGES,MELANOMA,INTERNET",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

An automatic extraction algorithm with the time-intensity curve (TIC) was proposed based on Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) in this study, and was applied to the framework of automatic analysis of cervical cancer tumors based on the deep belief networks, to assist doctors in the analysis of cervical cancer tumors. The framework was applied to the real clinical diagnostic data, and the feasibility of the method was verified by comparing the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Later, the parameters of patients' time to peak (TP), peak intensity (PI), mean transit time (MTT), and area under the curve (AUC) were obtained by drawing TICs, and the changes of p53 protein and ki-67 protein obtained by pathological section staining were analyzed to evaluate the therapeutic effect in the patients. It was found that the proposed model of tumor feature extraction based on the DBN had the higher accuracy (86.36%), sensitivity (83.33%), and specificity (87.50%). The related parameters of TIC curve obtained based on SNMF showed that there was a significant difference in p53 content between tissues with different degrees of disease (p < 0.05), the PI of poorly differentiated tissues was significantly higher than that of those with high to medium differentiation (p < 0.05). In addition, PI and AUC of patients after chemotherapy were significantly lower than that before chemotherapy (p < 0.05), while MTT was significantly higher than that before chemotherapy (p < 0.05). Therefore, the proposed TIC feature extraction of CEUS images based on SNMF and the automatic tumor classification based on deep learning can be used in the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of cervical cancer patients.","Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization,Deep belief networks,Time-intensity curve,Feature extraction,Cervical cancer",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.344,"CONTRAST,EXPRESSION,KI-67,P16",JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,,

Currently, the gold standard method requires incubation for 1824 h and subsequent inspection for growth by a trained medical technologist. We demonstrate an automated, cost-effective optical system that delivers early AST results, minimizing incubation time and eliminating human errors, while remaining compatible with standard phenotypic assay workflow. The system is composed of cost-effective components and eliminates the need for optomechanical scanning. A neural network processes the captured optical intensity information from an array of fiber optic cables to determine whether bacterial growth has occurred in each well of a 96-well microplate. When the system was blindly tested on isolates from 33 patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections, 95.03% of all the wells containing growth were correctly identified using our neural network with an average of 5.72 h of incubation time required to identify growth. Ninety percent of all wells (growth and no-growth) were correctly classified after 7 h, and 95% after 10.5 h. Our deep learning-based optical system met the FDA-defined criteria for essential and categorical agreements for all 14 antibiotics tested after an average of 6.13 and 6.98 h, respectively. Furthermore, our system met the FDA criteria for major and very major error rates for 11 of 12 possible drugs after an average of 4.02 h, and 9 of 13 possible drugs after an average of 9.39 h, respectively. This system could enable faster, inexpensive, automated AST, especially in resource-limited settings, helping to mitigate the rise of global AMR.","antimicrobial resistance,neural networks,machine learning,fiber optics,computational imaging",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Optics,Physics",,7.718,"STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS,BACTERIAL-GROWTH,RESISTANCE,ANTIBIOTICS,MICROSCOPY,OVERUSE",ACS PHOTONICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11454,

Bimetallic systems, in particular, often adopt very different compositions and morphologies at surfaces compared to the bulk. For the first time, we reveal a detailed atomistic picture of long-time scale restructuring of Pd deposited on Ag using microscopy, spectroscopy, and novel simulation methods. By developing and performing accelerated machine-learning molecular dynamics followed by an automated analysis method, we discover and characterize previously unidentified surface restructuring mechanisms in an unbiased fashion, including Pd-Ag place exchange and Ag pop-out as well as step ascent and descent. Remarkably, layer-by-layer dissolution of Pd into Ag is always preceded by an encapsulation of Pd islands by Ag, resulting in a significant migration of Ag out of the surface and a formation of extensive vacancy pits within a period of microseconds. These metastable structures are of vital catalytic importance, as Ag-encapsulated Pd remains much more accessible to reactants than bulk-dissolved Pd. Our approach is broadly applicable to complex multimetallic systems and enables the previously intractable mechanistic investigation of restructuring dynamics at atomic resolution.","ADSORBATE-INDUCED CHANGES,FINDING SADDLE-POINTS,SELECTIVE HYDROGENATION,CO ADSORPTION,PD,SEGREGATION,CATALYST,AU,REARRANGEMENT,ARCHITECTURE",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,15.801,"ADSORBATE-INDUCED,CHANGES,FINDING,SADDLE-POINTS,SELECTIVE,HYDROGENATION,CO,ADSORPTION,PD,SEGREGATION,CATALYST,AU,REARRANGEMENT,ARCHITECTURE",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/itempdf74155353254prod/11811660/Evolution_of_Metastable_Structures_at_Bimetallic_Surfaces_from_Microscopy_and_Machine-Learning_Molecular_Dynamics_v4.pdf,

Photonic artificial intelligence allows speech recognition, image classification, and Ising machines. Modern machine learning paradigms, as extreme learning machines, reveal that disordered and biological materials may realize optical neural networks with thousands of nodes trained only at the input and at the readout. May we use living matter for machine learning? Here, we employ living three-dimensional tumor brain models to demonstrate a random optical learning machine (ROM) for the investigation of glioblastoma. The tumor spheroid act as a computational reservoir. The ROM detects cancer morphodynamics by laser-induced hyperthermia, quantifies chemotherapy, and cell metabolism. The ROM is a sensitive noninvasive smart probe for cytotoxicity assay and enables real-time investigation of tumor dynamics. We hence design and demonstrate a novel bio-hardware for optical computing and the study of light/complex matter interaction.

Differing from previous works, this paper proposes a peak load shifting model to smooth the net load curve of an integrated electricity and natural gas system by coordinating the operations of the power-to-gas unit and generators. Moreover, the study aims to achieve multi-objective optimization while considering the economy of the system. A dynamic energy conversion and management strategy is proposed, which coordinates both the economic cost target and the peak load shifting target by adjusting an economic coefficient. To illustrate the complex energy conversion process, deep reinforcement learning is used to formulate the dynamic energy conversion and management problem as a discrete Markov decision process, and a deep deterministic policy gradient is adopted to solve the decision-making problem. By using the deep reinforcement learning method, the system operator can adaptively determine the conversion ratio of wind power, power-to-gas and gas turbine operations, and generator output through an online process, where the flexibility of wind power generation, wholesale gas price, and the uncertainties of energy demand are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can increase the profit of the system operator, reduce wind power curtailment, and smooth the net load curves effectively in real time.","Renewable energy accommodation,Dynamic energy conversion and management,Deep reinforcement learning",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Thermodynamics,Energy & Fuels,Mechanics",,8.954,"POWER-GENERATION,STORAGE,OPTIMIZATION,NETWORK",ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,,
