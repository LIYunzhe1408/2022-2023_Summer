The goal of the studies was to compare the performance of AFib detection using different ML algorithms in short PPG segments containing 32 consecutive cardiac cycles. Four parameters describing time series of interbeat intervals (IBI) were derived from the time domain Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and used as features for classification algorithms. Optimal values of metaparameters for all considered ML algorithms were experimentally determined. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score were then calculated to measure the quality of detection performance of each classification algorithm.","AFib detection,machine learning,photoplethysmography,PPG,HRV,IBI",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Optics,Physics",,,,,,

Although we performed examinations with a full EEG 10-20 montage system, we decided to assess the results obtained from different small sets of frontal electrodes to consider subset of electrodes which would have the performance in people verification system based on their EEG signals. Additionally, for reference, we included results achieved from all 19 electrodes. The sets of electrodes were chosen for their easy access and the possibility of using in commercially available EEG headsets or bundles. Over 700 examinations were collected from 36 healthy adults (almost 20 EEG sessions were recorded from each person). The first 15 examinations from each participant were used for training the feedforward neural network with the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. For each person, the different neural network was created. In the next step, people were verified using these networks by means of statistical metrics evaluation. The metrics were calculated using examinations which were recorded on different days both for the training and testing sets. Thanks to this approach, we were able to exclude the impact of daily changes in EEG and to get closer to the actual use of such a system. In this preliminary study, we focused on spectral features of EEG signals, to investigate whether temporary changes would prevent people from being recognized. Due to the large dataset, this paper can be the introduction for further works on searching and selecting features that will allow verification and will be invariable in time.","EEG,electroencephalography,biometry,verification,neural network",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Optics,Physics",,,,,,

However, the performance of deep learning models depends greatly on the quality and quantity of the datasets used. Due to the complexity and high costs of patient data collection, many medical datasets, particularly for pathological conditions, suffer from small sample sizes. Hence, developing a deep learning solution for breast cancer classification is still challenging. Data augmentation is one of the popular approaches to bridge this gap. In this work, we propose to use Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) for data augmentation. The aim of training CGANs is to generate a new set of realistic synthetic images and combine these together with real images to form a new augmented training set. The experiments show that most of the images produced by CGAN are reliable and classification performance with CGAN-based data augmentation can achieve good results. This method, unlike traditional data augmentation, can produce histopathological images that are completely different from the existing data. Therefore, this technique has the potential to address data scarcity and to directly benefit the training of deep learning models.","Breast cancer classification,Deep learning,Histopathological images,Data augmentation,CGANs",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Computer Science,,,,,,

6,Progress and prospects on information acquisition methods of abandoned farmland,36,23,258-268,",,,","Chen Hang,Tan Yongzhong,Deng Xinyu,Xiao Wu",,,Chen Hang,"A farmland served as the carrier of grain production is an important material basis to the food security. The abandonment of farmland has become one of the most important problems in China's farmland utilization over the past 20 years, particularly on a series of social, economic, and environmental issues. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly capture the spatial and temporal information, including the accurate location, duration, and the scale of abandoned farmland, in order to evaluate the marginal trend, and further to maintain the sustainable use of farmland. According to the current status of information acquisition methods for the abandoned farmland, this study was first to summarize the advanced methods of acquiring abandoned farmland information, and then to make a comprehensive prospect for the directions of future research. The results show that: 1) Three types can be divided in the methods of information acquisition: sampling survey, literature meta-analysis, and remote sensing. 2) In a sampling survey, the information acquisition method of abandoned farmland was widely used in small-scale case studies, indicating a nearly consistent research paradigm, but the spatial representation ability was relatively weak. To a certain extent, the national household survey data increased the spatial attribute of data, but the secondary screening of original data reduced the sample size and the credibility. Moreover, most panel data has made it difficult to trace the abandoned farmland information in different historical stages. 3) In literature meta-analysis, the information statistics method of abandoned farmland applied the idea of big data analysis, and further integrated the previous research data. It can be used to not only represent the abandonment rate and spatial-temporal changes of different regions, but also compare the main driving factors of abandoned farmland in different regions. However, the research findings of this method were confined to only a few published articles, while, a comprehensive understanding of hot keywords was highly demanding in related fields. At present, only a relatively few applications were found in the acquisition of abandoned farmland information. 4) Remote sensing can be expected to the mainstream for the information acquisition of abandoned farmland, as the development of satellites and computer technologies in the future. A variety of detection methods for the abandoned farmland have been developed, according to the object features and information changes of land use. There was still a large optimization space in the remote sensing, due to the high spatial resolution and large-scale extraction requirements. With the emergence of cloud computing and machine learning, the remote sensing has the promising potential to explore large-scale and high-resolution detection of abandoned farmland. Therefore, future research can be further explored in data selection and processing, feature fusion, and method fusion. The findings can provide an appropriate reference for the detection and management of farmland use.",land use; data; farmland; abandoned farmland; information acquisition,Review,,,,,,,,

The detection of existence of lung cancer can be performed in a variety of ways, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiography, and computed tomography (CT). Such techniques take up a lot of time and financial resources. Nevertheless, for the detection of lung cancer, CT provides a lower cost, fast imaging time and increased availability. Early diagnosis of lung cancer may help physicians treat patients in order to minimize the number of deaths. This paper revolves around the categorization of lung Cancer Stages from CT Scan Images Using Image Processing and k-Nearest Neighbours. The central objective of this study is therefore to establish an image processing technique for extracting features of lung cancer from CT scan images. Extracting the features from the segmented image can help to detect the cancer inside the lung. The purposed method comprises the following steps by using image processing techniques: data collection, data pre-processing, features selection and lung cancer classification. The pre-processing was done using a median filter to remove noise contained in the images. There are three features that need to be extracted which are; area, perimeter and centroid. Finally, the set of data with these features were used as inputs for lung cancer classification.

The efficiency of concrete is based on the easiness to place and to compact, which is usually known as workability. However, concrete strength and workability works in different ways; hence it is important to divide concrete into two groups: concrete with low workability and concrete with high workability, in order to achieve a more accurate prediction. Since there is a lot of variations of concrete mix designs, the relationship between each mixture is complex and, thus, requires advanced prediction methods in order to find the most accurate relationships between concrete mix proportion and its compression test result. Recently, many studies have been conducted on applying multiple artificial intelligence (AI) methods in building different complex and challenging prediction models. Thus, this research employs ensemble machine learning methods to precisely forecast compression strength of concrete mix proportion. The accuracy of the proposed method was calculated using two performance measurements. Subsequently, the study has successfully built the prediction model that can accurately map the relationship between concrete mix proportion and compressive strength.","slump test,workability",Proceedings Paper,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Engineering",,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1625/1/012024/pdf,

Previously, traditional trial-and-error of concrete mix design were used to achieve desired slump and flow test value. However, the experiment is often inexpensive, and the obtained results may not be sufficiently accurate. Recently, the potential of the AI method has been gaining increased attention as the new and promising alternative method to predict slump and flow tests, based on historical data.

16,CNN-based augmentation strategy for spectral unmixing datasets considering spectral variability,11533,,,"Anastasiadis Johannes,Heizmann Michael","Anastasiadis J,Heizmann M",Anastasiadis J,10.1117/12.2575875,Helmholtz Association,"Spectral unmixing is often relying on a mixing model that is only an approximation. Artificial neural networks have the advantage of not requiring model knowledge. Additional advantages in the domain of spectral unmixing are the easy handling of spectral variability and the possibility to force the sum-to-one and the non-negativity constraints. However, they need a lot of significant training data to achieve good results.
To overcome this problem, mainly for classification problems, augmentation strategies are widely used to increase the size of training datasets synthetically. Spectral unmixing can be considered as a regression problem, where data augmentation is also feasible. One intuitive strategy is to generate spectra based on abundances that do not occur in the training dataset, while taking spectral variability into account.
For the implementation of this approach, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN), where the input variables are extended by random values. This allows spectral variability to be taken into account. The random inputs are re-sampled for each data point in every epoch. During training the CNN learns the mixing model and the characteristic spectral variability of the training dataset. Additional spectra can be generated afterwards for any given abundances to extend the original training dataset.
Because the generative CNN minimizes the error between generated spectra and the corresponding ground truth for the whole dataset during training, the variance of the spectra based on the same abundances is lower than in the training data. We have investigated two approaches for improvement. One is to increase the variance of the random input variables when generating new spectra. For the second, the estimated covariance matrices are considered by the objective function.
The presented method is evaluated with real data, which were captured in our image processing laboratory. We found that the augmentation of the training dataset with the presented strategy leads to an improvement for spectral unmixing of the test dataset.","Spectral unmixing,spectral variability,data augmentation,convolutional neural network",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Remote Sensing,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"MATERIAL,ABUNDANCES",,https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000123897/109820817,

The result is a significant increase in availability, applications and, consequently, data volume. Compression is required to facilitate the transmission and storage of hyperspectral data sets. The high spectral correlation between adjacent bands allows for decorrelation approaches to compress the data with minimal loss of important information. Since it is not known a priori which feature is essential, the compression of hyperspectral data is a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an approach to compress hyperspectral data using a Deep Autoencoder. An Autoencoder is an artificial neural network that first learns the important features from the data, and subsequently reconstructs the data from the reduced encoded representation. The evaluation is done by comparing the classification performance between the original and the reconstructed data. As a classifier we use the Adaptive Coherence Estimator to compare the spectral signatures. Performance is assessed by comparing the mean classification accuracy for a fixed false alarm rate. Additionally, the Signal to Noise Ratio and the spectral angle are used as metrics for evaluating the reconstruction performance. Airborne hyperspectral data were used in combination with simulated data, representing a linear mixture with different ratios of target and background spectra. Multiple target and background materials are tested to compare the performance. The selected data provide a representative set of target and background spectra to evaluate the compression method in relation to the detection limit. The compression rate is set to 4:1 and the reconstruction accuracy is investigated. Additionally, classification of noisy data is compared to the compression results to show the impact of information loss. If both results are similar, it can be deduced that the compression process is near-lossless.","hyperspectral,near-lossless compression,Autoencoder (AE),deep learning,detection limit,classification",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Remote Sensing,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

The developed models are shown capable of predicting them (Fz and Mz) to a great level. The confirmation experiments provided favorable results with accuracy of 4% and 4.5%, for the thrust force (Fz) and the cutting torque (Mz) respectively. Furthermore the R coefficient for the prediction model of the thrust force is 0.99608 and 0.9946 for the cutting torque.

EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy, which causes abnormalities in EEG readings. It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders, depth of anesthesia, coma, encephalopathy, brain death, and depression. Being one of the prevalent psychiatric disorders, depressive episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD) is often misdiagnosed or overlooked. Therefore, identifying MDD at earlier stages of treatment could help to facilitate efficient and specific treatment. In this article, Random Forest (RF) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm are used to reduce the number of features by removing irrelevant and redundant features. The selected features are then fed into k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and SVM classifiers, a mathematical tool for data classification, regression, function estimation, and modeling processes, in order to classify MDD and non-MDD subjects. The proposed method used Wavelet Transformation (WT) to decompose the EEG data into corresponding frequency bands, like delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. A total of 119 participants were recruited by the University of Arizona from introductory psychology classes based on survey scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The performance of KNN and SVM classifiers is measured first with all the features and then with selected significant features given by RF and ACO. It is possible to discriminate 44 MDD and 75 non-MDD subjects efficiently using 15 of 65 channels and 3 of 5 frequency bands to improve the performance, where the significant features are obtained by the RF method. It is found that the classification accuracy has been improved from 70.21% and 76.67% using all the features to the corresponding 91.67% and 83.33% with only significant features using KNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) respectively.","Electroencephalogram,Major Depressive Disorder,Bipolar Disorder,Wavelet Transformation,K-Nearest Neighbors,Support Vector Machine,Random Forest,Ant Colony Optimization",Proceedings Paper,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Computer Science,,,,"2020 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, METAHEURISTICS & SWARM INTELLIGENCE (ISMSI 2020)",https://dl.acm.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1145%2F3396474.3396480&file=p65-bandopadhyay-corrigendum.pdf&download=true,

The image as a material reproduction of visual perception, has a large number of retrieval requests all the time, but the traditional image target recognition annotation is mainly based on pixel-level supervised learning. In the face of massive high-quality image recognition, it is very difficult for users to query the target content accurately and quickly. Therefore, this paper studies the animal classification model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using transfer learning to pre-train the characteristics of the network and combined with the hybrid classification model of CNN. In the experiment, CATS/DOGS were used as the data set, and PyTorch was used to train the network model. Experimental research shows that the accuracy of 96.43% is achieved by using CNN+ transfer learning algorithm, which is significantly higher than that of traditional methods.

Results of the CBCs include amounts of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a unit blood sample. It is possible to diagnose diseases such as anemia when the numbers or shapes of red blood cells become abnormal. The percentage of white blood cells is one of the important indicators of many severe illnesses such as infection and cancer. The amounts of platelets are decreased when the patient suffers hemophilia. Doctors often use these as criteria to monitor the general health conditions and recovery stages of the patients in the hospital. However, many hospitals are relying on expensive hematology analyzers to perform these tests, and these procedures are often time consuming. There is a huge demand for an automated, fast and easily used CBCs method in order to avoid redundant procedures and minimize patients' burden on costs of healthcare. In this research, we investigate a new CBC detection method by using deep neural networks, and discuss state of the art machine learning methods in order to meet the medical usage requirements. The approach we applied in this work is based on YOLOv3 algorithm, and our experimental results show the applied deep learning algorithms have a great potential for CBCs tests, promising for deployment of deep learning methods into microfluidic point-of-care medical devices.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to use deep transfer learning for tongue image analysis. First, we extract the tongue features through the pre-trained networks (ResNet and Inception_v3), and then rewrite the output layer of the original network with global average pooling and full-connected layer to output classification results.

The statistical characteristics of color histograms in multiple color space and texture features, lip color features are then introduced to describe the facial complexion. Finally, several machine learning methods including KNN, SVM and BPNN are used for classification.

From these candidates, three were selected for monomer synthesis and polymerization because of their synthetic accessibility and their potential for ease of processing in further applications.

Class activation maps visualized physical changes that allowed the NNs to separate diatom strains, subsequently establishing a specific gene that controls pores. A further NN was created to batch process image data, automatically recognize pores, and extract pore-related parameters.

Furthermore, we rely on 3D-3D image-based registration to combine labels from different ultrasound acquisitions of the same muscle with different qualities. Our goal here is to provide a simple and low-cost solution, relying mainly on open-source software for the processing steps. The proposed approach effectively reduces the manual interaction time while providing reasonable estimations for the segmentation and volume calculation. We achieve a mean dice score of 0.89 +/- 0.03 and a mean volumetric measure error of 4,18%. The resultant volumes may also be useful for building augmented annotated databases to develop automatic learning-based segmentation approaches.","3D freehand Ultrasound,label propagation,volume measurements",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Optics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,,

This effect may be escalated by the \data deluge"" caused by acquisition of more complex patient data during routine care. The objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic model for predicting the future clinical episodes of a patient using observed vital sign values prior to a clinical event. Vital signs (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure) are used to monitor a patient's physiological functions and their simultaneous changes indicate transitions between patient's health states. If such changes are abnormal then it may lead to serious physiological deterioration. The CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology was used as a data mining process and then we used Markov chains to identify the clinical states through which the patient passes. Then, a Hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach was applied for classification and prediction of patient's deterioration by computing the probability of future clinical states. Both learning models were trained and evaluated using six vital signs data from 94,678 records from 90 patient, collected from the database of real patients who were in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Central Military Hospital in the city of Bogota, Colombia.

However, these networks have a larger number of parameters and take longer to train than their 2D counterparts. Here we propose a 2D slice-based recurrent neural network model, which takes in an ordered sequence of sagittal slices as input to predict the brain age. The model consists of two components: a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN), which encodes the relevant features from the slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns the relationship between slices. We compare our method to other recently proposed methods, including 3D deep convolutional regression networks, information theoretic models, and bag-of-features (BoF) models (such as BagNet) - where the classification is based on the occurrences of local features, without taking into consideration their global spatial ordering.

Finer-scale mapping of the effects of obesity on the brain would help to understand how it promotes or interacts with disease effects, but so far, the influence of the obesity on finer-scale maps of anatomy remains unclear. In this study, we propose a deep transfer learning network based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMTNet) to classify individuals with normal versus overweight/obese body mass index (BMI) using vertex-wise brain shape metrics extracted from structural MRI scans from the UK Biobank study. First, an area-preserving mapping was used to project 3D brain surface meshes onto 2D planar meshes. Vertex-wise maps of brain metrics such as cortical thickness were mapped into 2D planar images for each brain surface extracted from each person's MRI scan. Second, several popular networks pretrained on the ImageNet database, i.e., VGG19, ResNet152 and DenseNet201, were used for transfer learning of brain shape metrics. We combined all shape metrics and generated a metric ensemble classification, and then combined all three networks and generated a network ensemble classification. The results reveal that transfer learning always outperforms direct learning, and we obtained accuracies of 65.6 +/- 0.7% and 62.7 +/- 0.7% for transfer and direct learning in the network ensemble classification, respectively. Moreover, surface area and cortical thickness, especially in the left hemisphere, consistently achieved the highest classification accuracies, together with subcortical shape metrics. The findings suggest a significant and classifiable influence of obesity on brain shape. Our proposed OMTNet method may offer a powerful transfer learning framework that can be extended to other vertex- wise brain structural and functional imaging measures.","transfer learning,brain shape,optimal mass transport,magnetic resonance imaging,body mass index,UK Biobank",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Optics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"SURFACE-BASED,ANALYSIS",,,

The destruction of the roadway is the result of various factors: for example, the use of low-quality material, non-compliance with the standards of laying asphalt, external physical impact, etc. Detection of these damages in automatic mode with high speed and accuracy is an important and complex task. An effective solution to this problem can reduce the time of services that carry out the detection of damage and also increase the safety of road users. The main challenge for automatically detecting such damage, in most cases, is the complex structure of the roadway. To accurately detect this damage, we use U-Net. After that we improve the binary map with localized cracks from the U-Net neural network, using the morphological filtering. This solution allows localizing cracks with higher accuracy in comparison with traditional methods crack detection, as well as modern methods of deep learning.

DR is the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults around the world and estimated it may affect more than 93 million people. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or controlled if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.
Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process, which requires an ophthalmologist or trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina, to identify DR by the presence of lesions associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease.
The automated method of DR screening will speed up the detection and decision-making process, which will help to control or manage DR progression. This paper presents an automated classification system, in which it analyzes fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view and generates a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning models such as CNN, VGG-16 and VGG-19.

59,Machine Vision for Construction Equipment by Transfer Learning with Scale Models,,,,"Borngrund Carl,Bodin Ulf,Sandin Fredrik","Borngrund C,Bodin U,Sandin F",Borngrund C,,Lulea University of Technology,"Machine vision is required by autonomous heavy construction equipment to navigate and interact with the environment. Wheel loaders need the ability to identify different objects and other equipment to perform the task of automatically loading and dumping material on dump trucks, which can be achieved using deep neural networks. Training such networks from scratch requires the iterative collection of potentially large amounts of video data, which is challenging at construction sites because of the complexity of safely operating heavy equipment in realistic environments. Transfer learning, for which pretrained neural networks can be retrained for use at construction sites, is thus attractive, especially if data can be acquired without full-scale experiments. We investigate the possibility of using scale-model data for training and validating two different pretrained networks and use real-world test data to examine their generalization capability. A dataset containing 268 images of a 1:16 scale model of a Volvo A60H dump truck is provided, as well as 64 test images of a full-size Volvo A25G dump truck. The code and dataset are publicly available1. The networks, both pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset, were fine-tuned to the created dataset, and the results indicate that both networks can learn the features of the scale-model dump truck (validation mAP of 0.82 for YOLOv3 and 0.95 for RetinaNet). Both networks can transfer these learned features to detect objects on a full-size dump truck with no additional training (test mAP of 0.70 for YOLOv3 and 0.79 for RetinaNet).","construction equipment,automation,computer vision,deep learning,machine learning",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to segment and quantify the FAZ accurately. Studies done to date have achieved reasonable segmentation but there is a need for considerable improvement. In order to test and validate newly developed automated segmentation algorithms, we have created a public dataset of these retinal fundus images. The 304 images in the dataset are classified into: diabetic (107), myopic (109) and normal (88) eyes. The images were classified by a clinical expert and include clinical grading of diabetic retinopathy and myopia. The images are of dimensions 420 x 420 pixels (6mm x 6mm of retina). Both clear and manually segmented by a clinical expert (ground truth) images are available (608 total images). In these images, the FAZ is the green region marked in manually segmented image. The images can be used to test newly developed techniques and the manual segmentation images can be used as a ground truth for making performance comparisons and validation. It should also be noted there are only a few studies using supervised learning to segment the FAZ and this dataset will potentially be useful for machine learning training and validation.

Humans and pigs acquire cysticercosis ingesting T. solium eggs by the fecal-oral route. After ingestion, oncospheres disperse throughout the body producing cysts mainly in the central nervous system and striated muscles. The treatment is focused on antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and antiepileptic drugs; however, new drugs are being studied in animal models recently. The aim of this study was to perform histological image analysis of pig brains with NCC after antiparasitic treatment to develop future tools to study brain inflammation since usually the evaluation of fibrosis is obtained manually on microscopy images in a long, inaccurate, poorly reproducible, and tedious process. For this purpose, the slides of pig brains with NCC were stained with Masson's Trichrome, and high quality photographic images were taken. Then, image processing and machine learning were performed to detect the presence and extension of collagen fibers around the cyst as markers of fibrosis. The process includes the use of color normalization and probabilistic classification implemented in Java language as a plugin to the free access program ImageJ. This paper presents a new method to detect cerebral fibrosis, assessing the amount of fibrosis in the images with accuracy above 75% in 12 seconds.

The avocado is a plant of great commercial interest for Peru and Colombia, countries that export this fruit. This tree is affected by a wide variety of diseases reducing its production, even causing the death of the plant. The most frequent disease of the avocado tree in the production zone of Peru is caused by the fungus Lasiodiplodia Theobromae, which is characterized in its initial stage by producing a chancre around the stems and branches of the tree. Detection is commonly made by manual inspection of the plants by an expert, which makes it difficult to detect the fungus in extensive plantations. Therefore, in this work we present a semi-automatic method for the detection of this disease based on image processing and machine learning techniques.

Lemons are classified according to their color in yellow, green and pinton (green lemons already showing a hint of yellow), since the yellow ones are for national consumption, while the other two types are for export. This selection is done manually. This process is time consuming and additionally lemons are frequently misclassified due to lack of concentration, exhaustion and experience of the worker, affecting the quality of the product sold in domestic and foreign markets. Therefore, this paper introduces a new method for the automatic classification of Citrus Aurantifolia, which comprises three stages: acquisition, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. A mechanical prototype for image acquisition in a controlled environment and a software for the classification of lemons were developed. A new segmentation method was implemented, which makes use only of the information obtained from the blue channel.

Junaid,Emerson Nyssa T.,Yang Haw","Yin SH,Amin MJ,Emerson NT,Yang H",Yang H,10.1117/12.2567752,Princeton University,"Biological processes such as processive enzyme turnover and intracellular cargo trafficking involve the dynamic motion of a small ""particle"" along a curvilinear biopolymer track. To understand these processes that occur across multiple length and time scales, one must acquire both the trajectory of the particle and the position of the track along which it moves, possibly by combining high-resolution single-particle tracking with conventional microscopy. Yet, usually there is a significant resolution mismatch between these modalities: while the tracked particle is localized with a precision of 10 nm, the image of the surroundings is limited by optical diffraction, with 200 nm lateral and 500 nm axial resolutions. Compared to the particle's trajectory, the surrounding curvilinear structure appears as a blurred and noisy image. This disparity in the spatial resolutions of the particle trajectory and the surrounding curvilinear structure image makes data reconstruction, as well as interpretation, particularly challenging. Analysis is further complicated when the curvilinear structures are oriented arbitrarily in 3D space. Here, we present a prior-apprised unsupervised learning (PAUL) approach to extract information from 3D images where the underlying features resemble a curved line such as a filament or microtubule. This three-stage framework starts with a Hessian-based feature enhancement, which is followed by feature registration, where local line segments are detected on repetitively sampled subimage tiles. In the final stage, statistical learning, segments are clustered based on their geometric relationships. Principal curves are then approximated from each segment group via statistical tools including principal component analysis, bootstrap and kernel transformation. This procedure is characterized on simulated images, where sub-voxel medium deviations from true curves have been achieved. The 3D PAUL approach has also been implemented for successful line localization in experimental 3D images of gold nanowires obtained using a multifocal microscope. This work not only bridges the resolution gap between two microscopy modalities, but also allows us to conduct 3D super line-localization imaging experiments, without using super-resolution techniques.","principal curves,super resolution,clustering,resolution matching",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1650381,

In the current super-resolution (SR) methods with the usage of deep learning, some low-level structural information tends to gradually disappear as the network deepens, resulting in excessive smoothness in high-frequency regions. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in MRI with poor brightness contrast and small gray dynamic range. Although the generative adversarial network (GAN) can repair structured textures well in natural images, it is likely to learn patterns that do not exist in the images, which poses risks to the reconstruction of medical images. Therefore, we propose an enhanced gradient guiding network (EG(2)N) to alleviate these problems. On the one hand, for improving the contrast and suppress the noise effectively, we use a multi-scale wavelet enhancement for preprocessing, where the enhanced gradient map is considered as the structural prior. On the other hand, blindly using dense connections in the feed-forward network will bring about redundancy, so structural features from an additional branch are added to specific layers as a supplement to high-level features and constrain optimization. We add a feedback mechanism to promote cross-layer flow between low-level and high-level features. In addition, the perceptual loss is added to avoid distortion caused by excessive smoothing. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best visual results and excellent performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on most popular MR images SR benchmarks.","Magnetic Resonance,Super-Resolution,Wavelet Transform,Enhanced Gradient,Feedback Mechanism",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

Considering the training data are often limited in biomedical tasks, a trade-off has to be made between model size and its representational power. To address this concern, in this paper, we propose a novel 3D Dense Separated Convolution (3D-DSC) module to replace the original 3D convolutional kernels. The 3D-DSC module is constructed by a series of densely connected 1D filters. The decomposition of 3D kernel into 1D filters reduces the risk of overfitting by removing the redundancy of 3D kernels in a topologically constrained manner, while providing the infrastructure for deepening the network. By further introducing nonlinear layers and dense connections between 1D filters, the network's representational power can be significantly improved while maintaining a compact architecture.

However, the inherent variability of EMG signal hinders the flexible and accurate control of advanced multi-functional prosthesis. This study is an attempt to use ultrasonography (US) as an alternative for prosthetic hand control. A type of multi-sensory module, comprising a single-element ultrasound channel and one sEMG bipolar channel, is customised to ensure a fair comparison between these two modalities. Three machine-learning-oriented approaches were adopted to evaluate the performance in motion classification based on datasets captured from a trans-radial amputee. The experimental results demonstrated that the ultrasound outperformed the sEMG in random (98.9% vs 70.4%) and enhanced-trial-wise (74.10% vs 61.83%) cross-validation, but fell behind the sEMG in trial-wise (39.47% vs 58.04%) validation that is the closest comparison to a real life prosthetic control. This study preliminarily implies that 1) A-mode ultrasound signal can be more stable than the sEMG with minimum electrode shift, but more sensitive to external interference than the sEMG; and 2) to maintain high classification accuracy, US approach may require harsher electrode fixing mechanism or advanced on-line calibration approach.

Evolutionary algorithms (EA) offer a flexible solution to this twofold issue, while the expensive simulations of the deep learner with the generated configurations are resolved by surrogate modelling. Three models have been used and evaluated as surrogates: random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and Kriging. Sample convolutional configurations are generated by Latin hypercube sampling and have attached computed accuracy outcomes from real CNN runs. For the hyperparameter estimation task, the fitness of an individual from the EA associated with a surrogate model is subsequently derived from the CNN accuracy estimation on those variable values. With respect to the ranking and variable selection task, RF includes implicit variable selection, the SVM can be straightforwardly supported by a second EA, and Kriging offers a ranking based on the corresponding theta values. The estimated accuracy of the found hyperparameter values is compared with the true validation accuracy, and they are next used for the prediction on the test cases. The ranking of the variables for each of the three surrogate models is compared, and their influence is also revealed by response surface methodology.

Although it is theoretically possible to measure the kinematics of body segments and classify exercise forms with wearable sensors and algorithms, the current implementations are not sufficiently accurate. In this study, the squat posture classification performance of deep learning was compared to that of conventional machine learning. Additionally, the location for the optimal placement of sensors was determined. Accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected from 39 healthy participants using five inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the left thigh, right thigh, left calf, right calf, and lumbar region. Each participant performed six repetitions of an acceptable squat and five incorrect forms of squats that are typically observed in inexperienced exercisers. The accuracies of squat posture classification obtained using conventional machine learning and deep learning were compared. Each result was obtained using one IMU or a combination of two or five IMUs. When employing five IMUs, the accuracy of squat posture classification using conventional machine learning was 75.4%, whereas the accuracy using deep learning was 91.7%. When employing two IMUs, the highest accuracy (88.7%) was obtained using deep learning for a combination of IMUs on the right thigh and right calf. The single IMU yielded the best results on the right thigh, with an accuracy of 58.7% for conventional machine learning and 80.9% for deep learning. Overall, the results obtained using deep learning were superior to those obtained using conventional machine learning for both single and multiple IMUs.

The structural details of the cochlear implant and the temporal bone require a significantly higher image resolution than that (about 0.2 mm) provided by current medical CT scanners. In this paper, we propose a clinical micro-CT (CMCT) system design integrating conventional spiral cone-beam CT, contemporary interior tomography, deep learning techniques, and the technologies of a micro-focus X-ray source, a photon-counting detector (PCD), and robotic arms for ultrahigh-resolution localized tomography of a freely-selected volume of interest (VOI) at a minimized radiation dose level. The whole system consists of a standard CT scanner for a clinical CT exam and VOI specification, and a robotic micro-CT scanner for a local scan of high spatial and spectral resolution at minimized radiation dose. The prior information from the global scan is also fully utilized for background compensation of the local scan data for accurate and stable VOI reconstruction. Our results and analysis show that the proposed hybrid reconstruction algorithm delivers accurate high-resolution local reconstruction, and is insensitive to the misalignment of the isocenter position, initial view angle and scale mismatch in the data/image registration. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of our system design. We envision that deep learning techniques can be leveraged for optimized imaging performance.

Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However, successful construction of predictive models, such as deep learning models, from fMRI requires addressing key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC) features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of granularity. Once an accurate diagnostic model has been built, it is vital to determine which features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas granularity levels. Identifying new important features extends our understanding of the biological underpinnings of ASD, while identifying features that corroborate past findings and extend across atlas levels instills model confidence. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations, probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor gyrus and language association cortex, regions whose abnormal development are associated with deficits in social and sensory processing common in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.","Interpretable deep learning,hyper parameter optimization,functional neuroimaging,fMRI,Autism",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990265,

The simulation results show that the proposed SSDA method obtains fairly high assessment accuracy and strong robustness than the total projection to latent structures (T-PLS) method even under strong noise interference environment.","Process Operating Performance Assessment,Stacked Sparse Denoising Auto-encoder,Softmax Regression,Gold Hydrometallurgy Process",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Automation & Control Systems,,,"NONOPTIMAL,CAUSE,IDENTIFICATION",,,
96,A Steam Detection Method for Liquor Distillation in the Process of Feeding,,,3394-3399,"Xu Yuemei,Jia Mingxing,Yang Yifan,Ding Shuai","Xu YM,Jia MX,Yang YF,Ding S",Xu YM,,Northeastern University - China,"Chinese liquor culture has a long history. The traditional liquor-making technology belongs to the labor-intensive industry with the characteristics of high labor intensity and low production efficiency. Especially in the process of feeding for liquor distillation, factitious material filling method is laborious and inefficient. Therefore, an intelligent control system is helpful for the process of material filling. The accuracy of steam detection result is the key factor determining the precision of adding material to the caldron. Corresponding to the characteristics of the moving robot arm and the light color and easy diffusion of the detected target steam in the process of adding material to the caldron, a steam detection method for adding material process is proposed in this paper. In the steam detection method, Firstly, suspected steam areas are detected by extracting motion characteristics, then, a feature fusion based BP neural network model is proposed to detect the steam in the suspected area. The proposed method is applied to the material filling process and the effectiveness is demonstrated.","liquor-making,steam detection method,steam characteristics,BP neural network",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Automation & Control Systems,,,,,,
97,Coating Thickness Modeling and Prediction for Hot-dip Galvanized Steel Strip Based on GA-BP Neural Network,,,3484-3489,"Mao Kai,Yang Yong-Li,Huang Zhe,Yang Dan-yang","Mao K,Yang YL,Huang Z,Yang DY",Mao K,,Wuhan University of Science & Technology,"To overcome the large time delay, strong nonlinear characteristics and multiple interference sources, a zinc coating thickness model must be constructed as an essential component for the steel strip hot dip galvanizing system. A BP neural network model was proposed to model and predict the thickness of hot-dip galvanized zinc layer. In the model, the main influences of the coating thickness such as the strip line speed, air knife pressure, air knife to strip distance and air knife height of the hot dip galvanizing system are used as the model input parameters, and the coating thickness as the model output parameter. Simulations shows that BP neural network occasionally fell into local optimum. Then a genetic algorithm was introduced to optimize the BP neural network, and the initialization weights and biases of the BP neural network were optimized in advance. Simulations shows the above-mentioned GA-BP algorithm has improved prediction accuracy and converges faster compared to conventional coating thickness models, and can be used in the close loop zinc layer thickness control system as feedback subsequently.","Coating thickness,Nonlinear,BP,GA-BP,Modeling,Prediction",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Automation & Control Systems,,,,,,

Chinese ports have become increasingly important. The fluctuation of container throughput in ports is affected by many factors. The effective and accurate forecasting of port throughput provides a scientific reference for the development of the port. Based on the port throughput data of Lianyun Port in China from the first quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2016, this paper uses univariate linear regression, multiple linear regression, and broad learning system to forecast the container throughput of the port in each quarter of 2017 and 2018. Comparing the forecasting results with the actual throughput. The experimental results show that the broad learning system can consider two economic influncing factors about the throughput at the same time and forecast port throughput accurately and effectively. Therefore, broad learning system is more suitable for the forecasting of port throughput than other methods.","Forecasting,Linear Regression Model,Port throughput,Broad Learning System",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Automation & Control Systems,,,,,,

EEG data in interictal and preictal periods from the CHB-MIT dataset are used for seizure prediction. First, the original signals are decomposed into several frequency bands using a digital wavelet transform (DWT). Then, features including standard deviation (S), log of amplitude (L), quartile (Q) and coefficient of variation (CV) are extracted. Finally, different combinations of feature vectors are fed into classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM)) to classify the above two states (preictal and interictal states). Performance analysis shows that the optimal feature is CV, the optimal sub-band is 16-31 Hz and the optimal EEG channel can be chosen as FP1-F7, T7-P7, FP1-F3, P3-O1 or P7-T7. By comparing the classification results, ELM provides a more robust and higher overall accuracy than SVM, and the best average accuracy of both ELM and SVM can reach as high as 100%.","EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE,EPILEPSY,SYSTEM",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Automation & Control Systems,,,"EXTREME,LEARNING-MACHINE,EPILEPSY,SYSTEM",,,
