1,3D Human Knee Flexion Angle Estimation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,,,5424-5427,"Chalangari Pouria,Fevens Thomas,Rivaz Hassan","Chalangari P,Fevens T,Rivaz H",Chalangari P,,Concordia University - Canada,"An Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury can cause a serious burden, especially for athletes participating in relatively risky sports. This raises a growing incentive for designing injury-prevention programs. For this purpose, the analysis of the drop jump landing test, for example, can provide a useful asset for recognizing those who are more likely to sustain knee injuries. Knee flexion angle plays a key role within these test scenarios. Multiple research efforts have been conducted on engaging existing technologies such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor and Motion Capture (MoCap) to investigate the connection between the lower limb angle ranges during jump tests and the injury risk associated with them. Even though these technologies provide sufficient capabilities to researchers and clinicians, they need certain levels of knowledge to enable them to utilize these facilities. Moreover, these systems demand special requirements and setup procedures which make them limiting. Due to recent advances in the area of Deep Learning, numerous powerful 3D pose estimation algorithms have been developed over the last few years. Having access to relatively reliable and accurate 3D body keypoint information can lead to successful detection and prevention of injury. The idea of combining temporal convolutions in video sequences with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a substantial opportunity to tackle the challenging task of accurate 3D human pose estimation. Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor as our ground truth, we analyze the performance of CNN-based 3D human pose estimation in everyday settings. The qualitative and quantitative results are convincing enough to give an incentive to pursue further improvements, especially in the task of lower extremity kinematics estimation. In addition to the performance comparison between Kinect and CNN, we have also verified the high-margin of consistency between two Kinect sensors.","CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURY,SYSTEM",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"CRUCIATE,LIGAMENT,INJURY,SYSTEM",,,
2,A Preliminary Study of Predicting Effectiveness of Anti-VEGF Injection Using OCT Images Based on Deep Learning,,,5428-5431,"Feng Dehua,Chen Xi,Zhou Zhiguo,Liu Haotian,Wang Yanfen,Bai Ling,Zhang Shu,Mou Xuanqin","Feng DH,Chen X,Zhou ZG,Liu HT,Wang YF,Bai L,Zhang S,Mou XQ",Mou XQ,,Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Deep learning based radiomics have made great progress such as CNN based diagnosis and U-Net based segmentation. However, the prediction of drug effectiveness based on deep learning has fewer studies. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and cystoid macular edema (CME) are the diseases often leading to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision. And the curative treatment using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) may not be effective for some patients. Therefore, the prediction of the effectiveness of anti-VEGF for patients is important. With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) coupled with transfer learning, medical image classifications have achieved great success. We used a method based on transfer learning to automatically predict the effectiveness of anti-VEGF by Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) images before giving medication. The method consists of image preprocessing, data augmentation and CNN-based transfer learning, the prediction AUC can be over 0.8. We also made a comparison study of using lesion region images and full OCT images on this task. Experiments shows that using the full OCT images can obtain better performance. Different deep neural networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16, GooLeNet and ResNet-50 were compared, and the modified ResNet-50 is more suitable for predicting the effectiveness of anti-VEGF.",CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS",,,

We envision a system that uses machine learning to automatically detect PD symptoms from accelerometer data collected in the wild. Building such systems, however, is challenging because it is difficult to obtain labels of symptom occurrences in the wild. Many researchers therefore train machine learning algorithms on laboratory data with the assumption that findings will translate to the wild. This paper assesses how well laboratory data represents wild data by comparing PD symptom (tremor) detection performance of three models on both lab and wild data. Findings indicate that, for this application, laboratory data is not a good representation of wild data. Results also show that training on wild data, even though labels are less precise, leads to better performance on wild data than training on accurate labels from laboratory data.","OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT,MOTOR SYMPTOMS,BRADYKINESIA,DYSKINESIA",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"OBJECTIVE,ASSESSMENT,MOTOR,SYMPTOMS,BRADYKINESIA,DYSKINESIA",,,

Early prediction of hypotensive events in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) allows clinicians to pre-emptively treat the patient and avoid possible organ damage. In this study, we investigate the performance of various supervised machine-learning classification algorithms along with a real-time labeling technique to predict acute hypotensive events in the ICU. It is shown that logistic regression and SVM yield a better combination of specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Logistic regression is able to predict 85% of events within 30 minutes of their onset with 81% PPV and 96% specificity, while SVM results in 96% specificity, 83% sensitivity and 82% PPV. To further reduce the false alarm rate, we propose a high-level decision-making algorithm that filters isolated false positives identified by the machine-learning algorithms. By implementing this technique, 24% of the false alarms are filtered. This saves 21 hours of medical staff time through 2,560 hours of monitoring and significantly reduces the disturbance caused by alarming monitors.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,,,

While phenotypic information, such as age and gender, is known to be important in diagnosing ADHD and critically affects the representation derived from fMRI brain images, limited studies have integrated phenotypic information when learning discriminative embedding from brain imaging for such an automatic classification task. In this work, we propose to integrate age and gender attributes through attention mechanism that is jointly optimized when learning a brain connectivity embedding using convolutional variational autoencoder derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. Our proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art average of 86.22% accuracy in ADHD vs. typical develop control (TDC) binary classification task evaluated across five public ADHD-200 competition datasets.

The implementation of measurable residual disease (MRD) using flow cytometry (FC) is highly effective but the interpretation is time-consuming and suffers from physician idiosyncrasy. Recent machine learning algorithms have been proposed to automatically classify acute leukemia samples with and without MRD to address this clinical need. However, most prior works either validate only on a small data cohort or focus on one specific type of leukemia which lacks generalization. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach in performing automatic MRD classification that takes advantage of a large scale acute myeloid leukemia (AML) database to facilitate better learning on a small cohort of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Specifically, we develop a knowledge-reserved distilled AML pre-trained network with ALL complementary learning to enhance the ALL MRD classification.

Irrespective of treatment options, approximately 1/3 will suffer secondary ACL injuries following their return to activity (RTA). Despite this, there are no evidence-informed RTA guidelines to aid clinicians in deciding when this should occur. The first step towards these guidelines is to identify relevant and feasible measures to assess the functional status of these patients. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate tests frequently used to assess functional capacity following surgery using a Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPT). Thirty-six healthy and forty-two ACL-injured adolescent females performed a series of functional tasks. Motion analysis along with spatiotemporal measures were used to extract thirty clinically relevant variables. The REPT reduced these variables down to two limb symmetry measures (maximum anterior hop and maximum lateral hop), capable of classifying injury status between the healthy and ACL injured participants with a 69% sensitivity, 78% specificity and kappa statistic of 0.464. We, therefore, conclude that the REPT model was able to evaluate functional capacity as it relates to injury status in adolescent females. We also recommend considering these variables when developing RTA assessments and guidelines.","CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION,ANTERIOR,SPORT,AGREEMENT,TRENDS",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"CRUCIATE,LIGAMENT,RECONSTRUCTION,ANTERIOR,SPORT,AGREEMENT,TRENDS",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9167168/9175149/09176010.pdf,
8,Nonlinear Machine Learning Models for Insulin Bolus Estimation in Type 1 Diabetes Therapy,,,5502-5505,"Noaro G.,Cappon G.,Sparacino G.,Del Favero S.,Facchinetti A.","Noaro G,Cappon G,Sparacino G,Del Favero S,Facchinetti A",Noaro G,,University of Padua,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) therapy requires multiple daily insulin injections to compensate the lack of endogenous insulin production due to fi-cells destruction. An empirical standard formula (SF) is commonly used for such a task. Unfortunately, SF does not include information on glucose dynamics, e.g. the glucose rate-of-change (ROC) provided by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Hence, SF can sometimes lead to under/overestimations that can cause critical hypo/hyperglycemic episodes during/after the meal. Recently, to overcome this limitation, we proposed new linear regression models, integrating ROC information and personalized features. Despite the first encouraging results, the nonlinear nature of the problem calls for the application of nonlinear models. In this work, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting tree (GBT), nonlinear machine learning methodologies, were investigated. A dataset of 100 virtual subjects, opportunely divided into training and testing sets, was used. For each individual, a single-meal scenario with different meal conditions (preprandial ROC, BG and meal amounts) was simulated. The assessment was performed both in terms of accuracy in estimating the optimal bolus and glycemic control. Results were compared to the best performing linear model previously developed. The two tree-based models proposed lead to a statistically significant improvement of glycemic control compared to the linear approach, reducing the time spent in hypoglycemia (from 32.49% to 27.57-25.20% for RF and GBT, respectively). These results represent a preliminary step to prove that nonlinear machine learning techniques can improve the estimation of insulin bolus in T1D therapy. Particularly, RF and GBT were shown to outperform the previously linear models proposed.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,,,

This necessitates the use of early pathological indicators of the disease such as amyloid abnormality to identify individuals at early disease stages where intervention is likely to be most effective. Recent evidence suggests that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta(1-42) (A beta(42)) level may indicate AD risk earlier compared to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). However, the method of collecting CSF is invasive. Blood-based biomarkers indicative of CSF A beta(42) status may remedy this limitation as blood collection is minimally invasive and inexpensive. In this study, we show that APOE4 genotype and blood markers comprising EOT3, APOC1, CGA, and A beta(42) robustly predict CSF A beta(42) with high classification performance (0.84 AUC, 0.82 sensitivity, 0.62 specificity, 0.81 PPV and 0.64 NPV) using machine learning approach. Due to the method employed in the biomarker search, the identified biomarker signature maintained high performance in more than a single machine learning algorithm, indicating potential to generalize well. A minimally invasive and cost-effective solution to detecting amyloid abnormality such as proposed in this study may be used as a first step in a multi-stage diagnostic workup to facilitate enrichment of clinical trials and population-based screening.","ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,AMYLOID BIOMARKERS,DEFINITION,SELECTION",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,AMYLOID,BIOMARKERS,DEFINITION,SELECTION",,,

This paper presents an automatic SCD-patient classifier we developed to identify patients with unexpected VF using 60-minutes continuous single-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) signals before that. Patients are classified as having SCD if the majority of their recorded ventricular repolarization (VR) is recognized as characteristic of unexpected VF. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual VR delineated from single-lead ECG signals as SCD VR, where VR from non-SCD patients are used as controls. With the reported clinical practices of SCD, we extracted five morphological and temporal features (both commonly used and newly developed ones) from ECG signals for VR classification. To evaluate classification performance, we trained and tested k nearest neighbor classifier, a decision tree classifier, and a Naive Bayes classifier using five-fold cross validation on 36 one-hour ECG signals (18 from patients at risk of SCD and 18 from control people). We compared the performance of these three classifiers, and the patient-classification sensitivity is approximately 98.02-99.51%. Moreover, the k nearest neighbor with a higher accuracy (98.89%) and specificity (98.27%) performed better than the other two.

Patients will have impaired and uncoordinated motor functionality making them unable to complete their day-to-day activities. Ataxia clinics are established around the world to facilitate research and rehabilitate patients. However, the patients are generally evaluated by human observation. Therefore, machine learning based data analysis is popular on motion captured via sensors. There are many neurological tests designed to analyse the motor impairments in different domains (such as upper limb, lower limb, gait, balance and speech). Clinicians follow scoring protocols to record the severity of patients for each domain test. This paper delivers a clinical assessment platform combining 12 neurological tests in 5 domains. It captures motion (from BioKin sensors), haptic and audio data (from the tablet or laptop screen). A data analysis system is hosted in a remote server which evaluates data to produce a severity score via different models built for each neurological test. The assessment platform clients and server communicate via a cloud buffer system. The scores input by the clinicians and predicted by the machine learning models are logged in the cloud database. This enables clinicians and doctors to view and compare the history of patient diagnosis. The server system is structured for automated score model upgrades via prompted approval.

Complications such as pain, stroke, and organ failure occur in SCD as malformed, sickled red blood cells passing through small blood vessels get trapped. Particularly, acute pain is known to be the primary symptom of SCD. The insidious and subjective nature of SCD pain leads to challenges in pain assessment among Medical Practitioners (MPs). Thus, accurate identification of markers of pain in patients with SCD is crucial for pain management. Classifying clinical notes of patients with SCD based on their pain level enables MPs to give appropriate treatment.

However, datasets containing both clinical information and spontaneous speech suitable for statistical learning are relatively scarce. In addition, speech data are often collected under different conditions, such as monologue and dialogue recording protocols. Therefore, there is a need for methods to allow the combination of these scarce resources. In this paper, we propose two feature extraction and representation models, based on neural networks and trained on monologue and dialogue data recorded in clinical settings. These models are evaluated not only for AD recognition, but also with respect to their potential to generalise across both datasets. They provide good results when trained and tested on the same data set (72.56% UAR for monologue data and 85.21% for dialogue). A decrease in UAR is observed in transfer training, where feature extraction models trained on dialogues provide better average UAR on monologues (63.72%) than the other way around (58.94%). When the choice of classifiers is independent of feature extraction, transfer from monologue models to dialogues result in a maximum UAR of 81.04% and transfer from dialogue features to monologue achieve a maximum UAR of 70.73%, evidencing the generalisability of the feature model.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,,https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/162965427/FuenteHaiderLuz20embc.pdf,

The respiratory modulations present in simple photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been useful to derive RR using signal processing, waveform fiducial markers, and hand-crafted rules. An end-to-end deep learning approach based on residual network (ResNet) architecture is proposed to estimate RR using PPG. This approach takes time-series PPG data as input, learns the rules through the training process that involved an additional synthetic PPG dataset generated to overcome the insufficient data problem of deep learning, and provides RR estimation as outputs. The inclusion of a synthetic dataset for training improved the performance of the deep learning model by 34%.

But automatic tubular structure segmentation in CT scans is a challenging problem, due to issues such as poor contrast, noise and complicated background. A tubular structure usually has a cylinder-like shape which can be well represented by its skeleton and cross-sectional radii (scales). Inspired by this, we propose a geometry-aware tubular structure segmentation method, Deep Distance Transform (DDT), which combines intuitions from the classical distance transform for skeletonization and modern deep segmentation networks. DDT first learns a multitask network to predict a segmentation mask for a tubular structure and a distance map. Each value in the map represents the distance from each tubular structure voxel to the tubular structure surface. Then the segmentation mask is refined by leveraging the shape prior reconstructed from the distance map. We apply our DDT on six medical image datasets. Results show that (1) DDT can boost tubular structure segmentation performance significantly (e.g., over 13% DSC improvement for pancreatic duct segmentation), and (2) DDT additionally provides a geometrical measurement for a tubular structure, which is important for clinical diagnosis (e.g., the cross-sectional scale of a pancreatic duct can be an indicator for pancreatic cancer).","VESSEL SEGMENTATION,RECONSTRUCTION",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"VESSEL,SEGMENTATION,RECONSTRUCTION",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03383,

One difficulty arises from the high cost associated with annotating tumor regions in WSIs. Furthermore, both global and local image features must be extracted from the WSI by changing the magnifications of the image. In addition, the image features should be stably detected against the differences of staining conditions among the hospitals/specimens.

To address these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised semantic transfer model including two complementary modules (i.e., T-D and T-F) for endoscopic lesions segmentation, which can alternatively determine where and how to explore transferable domain-invariant knowledge between labeled source lesions dataset (e.g., gastroscope) and unlabeled target diseases dataset (e.g., enteroscopy). Specifically, T-D focuses on where to translate transferable visual information of medical lesions via residual transferability-aware bottleneck, while neglecting untransferable visual characterizations. Furthermore, T-F highlights how to augment transferable semantic features of various lesions and automatically ignore untransferable representations, which explores domain-invariant knowledge and in return improves the performance of T-D.

For such scenarios, insights can be gained from the stratification approaches seen in manual clinical OAR delineation. This is the goal of our work, where we introduce stratified organ at risk segmentation (SOARS), an approach that stratifies OARs into anchor, mid-level, and small & hard (S&H) categories. SOARS stratifies across two dimensions. The first dimension is that distinct processing frameworks are used for each OAR category. In particular, inspired by clinical practices, anchor OARs are used to guide the mid-level and S&H categories. The second dimension is that distinct network architectures are used to manage the significant contrast, size, and anatomy variations between different OARs. We use differentiable neural architecture search (NAS), allowing the network to choose among 2D, 3D or Pseudo-3D convolutions. Extensive 4-fold cross-validation on 142 H&N cancer patients with 42 manually labeled OARs, the most comprehensive OAR dataset to date, demonstrates that both framework- and NAS-stratification significantly improves quantitative performance over the state-of-the-art (from 70.44% to 75.14% in absolute Dice scores). Thus, SOARS provides a powerful and principled means to manage the highly complex segmentation space of OARs.","AUTO-SEGMENTATION,CT IMAGES,MODELS",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"AUTO-SEGMENTATION,CT,IMAGES,MODELS",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08426,

Recent deep learning-based deformable image registration methods achieve fast image registration by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the spatial transformation from the synthetic ground truth or the similarity metric. However, these approaches often ignore the topology preservation of the transformation and the smoothness of the transformation which is enforced by a global smoothing energy function alone. Moreover, deep learning-based approaches often estimate the displacement field directly, which cannot guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient unsupervised symmetric image registration method which maximizes the similarity between images within the space of diffeomorphic maps and estimates both forward and inverse transformations simultaneously.

The non-invasive VC is normally used to inspect a 3D reconstructed colon (from CT scans) for polyps and if found, the OC procedure is performed to physically traverse the colon via endoscope and remove these polyps. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework, Extended and Directional CycleGAN, for lossy unpaired image-to-image translation between OC and VC to augment OC video sequences with scale-consistent depth information from VC, and augment VC with patient-specific textures, color and specular highlights from OC (e.g, for realistic polyp synthesis). Both OC and VC contain structural information, but it is obscured in OC by additional patient-specific texture and specular highlights, hence making the translation from OC to VC lossy. The existing CycleGAN approaches do not handle lossy transformations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce an extended cycle consistency loss, which compares the geometric structures from OC in the VC domain. This loss removes the need for the CycleGAN to embed OC information in the VC domain. To handle a stronger removal of the textures and lighting, a Directional Discriminator is introduced to differentiate the direction of translation (by creating paired information for the discriminator), as opposed to the standard CycleGAN which is direction-agnostic. Combining the extended cycle consistency loss and the Directional Discriminator, we show state-of-the-art results on scale-consistent depth inference for phantom, textured VC and for real polyp and normal colon video sequences.

To this end, the boundary key point selection algorithm is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the key points on the structural boundary of the target object are estimated. Then, a boundary preserving block (BPB) with the boundary key point map is applied for predicting the structure boundary of the target object. Further, for embedding experts knowledge in the fully automatic segmentation, we propose a novel shape boundary-aware evaluator (SBE) with the ground-truth structure information indicated by experts. The proposed SBE could give feedback to the segmentation network based on the structure boundary key point.

'lb tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel formulation to learn an enriched representation for imaging biomarkers that can simultaneously capture both the information conveyed by baseline neuroimaging records and that by progressive variations of varied counts of available follow-up records over time. While the numbers of the brain scans of the participants vary, the learned biomarker representation for every participant is a fixed-length vector, which enable us to use traditional learning models to study AD developments. Our new objective is formulated to maximize the ratio of the summations of a number of ti-norm distances for improved robustness, which, though, is difficult to efficiently solve in general. Thus we derive a new efficient iterative solution algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence.

While many methods exist for general multi-view 3D reconstruction, these methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance on endoscopic video. Part of the reason is that local descriptors that establish pairwise point correspondences, and thus drive reconstruction, struggle when confronted with the texture-scarce surface of anatomy. Learning-based dense descriptors usually have larger receptive fields enabling the encoding of global information, which can be used to disambiguate matches. In this work, we present an effective self-supervised training scheme and novel loss design for dense descriptor learning.

Methods to detect defects with atomic resolution in graphene can be technically demanding and involve complex sample preparations. An alternative approach is to observe the thermal vibration properties of the graphene sheet, which reflects defect information but in an implicit fashion. Machine learning, an emerging data-driven approach that offers solutions to learning hidden patterns from complex data, has been extensively applied in material design and discovery problems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to detect graphene defects by discovering the hidden correlation between defect locations and thermal vibration features. Two prediction strategies are developed: an atom-based method which constructs data by atom indices, and a domain-based method which constructs data by domain discretization. Results show that while the atom-based method is capable of detecting a single-atom vacancy, the domain-based method can detect an unknown number of multiple vacancies up to atomic precision. Both methods can achieve approximately a 90% prediction accuracy on the reserved data for testing, indicating a promising extrapolation into unseen future graphene configurations. The proposed strategy offers promising solutions for the non-destructive evaluation of nanomaterials and accelerates new material discoveries.","Machine learning,; Graphene; Defects; Molecular dynamics; Nanomaterials",Article,,,,,,,,

Here we show that a novel CycleGAN architecture can be derived as a Kantorovich dual OT formulation if a penalized least squares (PLS) cost with deep learning-based inverse path penalty is used as a transportation cost. One of the most important advantages of this formulation is that depending on the knowledge of the forward problem, distinct variations of CycleGAN architecture can be derived: for example, one with two pairs of generators and discriminators, and the other with only a single pair of generator and discriminator. Even for the two generator cases, we show that the structural knowledge of the forward operator can lead to a simpler generator architecture which significantly simplifies the neural network training.

We demonstrate the switching behavior of the neurons and their synaptic weight adaptations by formulating experiments in a manner consistent with real world trials used in the study of cognitive psychology. Using these experiments we show how our model adapts and responds to task changes exhibiting biological behaviors like Long Term Potentiation (LTP), Long Term Depression (LTD) and Task-set reconfiguration (TSR) thereby giving insights into understanding the importance of duration between changing tasks and its effect on performance and efficacies of multi-tasking.

Recently,A series of Unet-like deep neural networks have achieved good result in this task. These models are variants of encoder-decoder architecture and can be traced from FCN, which is designed for semantic segmentation task of natural images. However, compared with natural images, the target regions of H&E images are more salient and have lower entropy. In light of the characteristics of H&E stained images and inspired by the two-stage framework of traditional pure image processing methods, we propose an end-to-end network named InvUnet, which considers nuclear segmentation as a bottom-up stage-wise noise reduction process. The key insight is to take lower-level feature maps of CNN as the output of coarse segmentation, and assume that abstract semantic information from higher layers could guide the denoising process. InvUnet is U-shaped and consists of a contracting path like Unet and a denoising path. Contrary to the top-down structure of Unet's expansive path, the denoising path is bottom-up, starting from the bottom features and combining higher level information to refine the segmentation step-by-step. We conduct experiments on the public avaliable nuclear segmentation dataset. On pixel level segmentation task, InvUnet achieves cleaner segmentation results than Unet with only 1.26M parameters. On instance-level segmentation task, InvUnet combined with weight map for implicit contour learning achieves the best results in separating touching nuclei.","H&E stained images,nuclear segmentation,instance segmentation,CNN",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,2020 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (ICACI),,

Traditional accelerated aging experiments are performed to evaluate base dielectric materials for properties such as thermal class and the ability to withstand voltage over time. Physical models for dielectric aging have also been developed.
Emulators (aka predictive models) are statistical models trained using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to capture the input/output relationships of an underlying system or data set. Once trained, the emulator can be used in lieu of the process that generated the training data to rapidly predict outputs for arbitrary input combinations. Emulators can be created of both deterministic physics- based simulation codes and physical or experimental processes.
Using a simple physical motor model, the process of building an emulator will be illustrated. This process begins with a design of experiments to select input combinations for the experimental collection of training data from the physical model. The emulator's predictive accuracy can be iteratively improved through an adaptive design process that combines knowledge of the previously conducted experiments with the emulator's ability to assess areas of greatest uncertainty in its predictions.
The final validated emulator can be used for sensitivity analyses of inputs on the output(s) of interest, uncertainty propagation, and optimization. Applications of emulators include virtual sensors, predictive maintenance, calibration of physics-based simulation models, and digital twins. Avenues of application for an emulator of a motor model include predictions of motor life and dielectric failure probabilities based on dielectric and insulation material properties.","predictive analytics,statistical modeling,dielectrics,motors,testing",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,2020 IEEE ELECTRICAL INSULATION CONFERENCE (EIC),,

Computer-assisted diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging tool to support AD diagnosis. In this article, we explore the application of Supervised Switching Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD classification using only one structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder architectures, combining unsupervised representation and supervised classification as one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of SSAs to capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to disease state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based approach.
Methods: Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches extracted from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative locations, exploring different patch sizes and network parameterizations. Then, models perform binary class prediction - healthy (CDR = 0) or AD-demented (CDR > 0) - on test data at patch level. The final subject classification is performed employing a majority rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition, relevant regions are identified, by computing accuracy densities from patch-level predictions, and analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional definitions.
Results: Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per subject show that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely on full volumetric information and feature-engineered representations. SSAs classification accuracy on slices extracted along the Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes from a balanced cohort of 40 independent test subjects was 87.5%, 90.0%, and 90.0%, respectively. A top sensitivity of 95.0% on both Coronal and Sagittal planes was also obtained.
Conclusions: SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among previous classification proposals, including feature-engineered and feature learning based methods, using only one scan slice per subject, instead of the whole 3D volume, as it is conventionally done. In addition, regions identified as relevant by SSAs' were, in most part, coherent or partially coherent in regard to relevant regions reported on previous works. These regions were also associated with findings from medical knowledge, which gives value to our methodology as a potential analytical aid for disease understanding.","Alzheimer disease,Supervised autoencoder,Supervised switching autoencoder,Convolutional neural networks,Representation learning,Magnetic resonance imaging",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"ATROPHY,MRI,REPRESENTATION,BIOMARKERS,DIAGNOSIS,PATHOLOGY,PATTERNS",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

Notably, a portfolio of producer strains for a suite of material monomers was recently developed, some approaching industrial titers, in a tour de force by the Manchester Centre that was achieved in less than 90 days. New in silico design tools are providing significant contributions to the front end of the DBTL pipelines. At the same time, the far-reaching initiatives of modern biofoundries are generating a large amount of high-dimensional data and knowledge that can be integrated through automated learning to expedite the DBTL cycle. In this Perspective, the new design tools and the role of the learning component as an enabling technology for the next generation of automated biofoundries are discussed. Future biofoundries will operate under completely automated DBTL cycles driven by in silico optimal experimental planning, full biomanufacturing devices connectivity, virtualization platforms and cloud-based design.

However, thermally induced warpage is the critical issue for each and every researcher's problem. Using larger wafer and panel size, and mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) among the constituent material, the thermally induced warpage is occurred which needs to be controlled effectively for fan-out package industry. In this work, finite element method (FEM) is used to build the FOPLP by considering equivalent CTE of molding material and then thermally induced warpage issue in the molding process is investigated. To reduce the experimental time and cost, FEM is the best method to simulate and analysis of warpage in FOPLP. Simulation can build a set of warpage result database of different geometric structures of panel level package (PLP). In addition to that, this work has been introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach and the main purpose of this AI technique is to build a best model for warpage analysis by considering the design parameters like chip size, chip thickness, gap between the chips, thin film thick and so on. The best part of AI model is that, if numbers of different geometric parameters are used in this model then AI can predict the better warpage value without the help of FEM simulation. The implementation of machine learning concept which is an AI technique is to train the model from the different geometric model related to warpage datasets which are generated by FEM simulation. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is applied to learn the relationship between geometry and amount of warpage occurred from the generated database. To enhance the training process, it has also considered Edge Detection technique.

In order to implement predictive control for the HVAC system and natural ventilation, the model needs to have the capability to predict building thermal responses under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which would capture the effects of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. However, a deep neural network comes with a high demand for training data. In real-world applications, the target building may not have the necessary amount of operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could solve this dilemma. By freezing partial weights of a deep neural network model that is pretrained on multi-year data from a base case building, it can be quickly deployed to different buildings in other climates. With much fewer trainable parameters, the model can then be well-trained on only 15 days of data from the new target building. The base case and target case can have entirely different floor areas, building materials, and window sizes. This transfer learning model performs significantly better than a comparable model that is only trained on source data or target data, achieving high predicting accuracy on both indoor air temperature and relative humidity in the time horizon from 10 minutes to two hours. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building. It has a high sample efficiency and shortens the minimum data collection period for model training.","BUILDINGS,OPTIMIZATION,SYSTEMS,DESIGN",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,,"BUILDINGS,OPTIMIZATION,SYSTEMS,DESIGN",,,

To achieve this aim, four features were extracted from one minute RR time series as well as from their derivatives and were subjected to PCA and RVM. PCA, as explanatory method, has shown that detection of AF arrhythmia became straightforward by targeting the second derivative time series. RVM was optimized through four kernel functions and the best model has reached 99.83% success rate to diagnosis AF and normal rhythm.

A detailed analysis of the most common models of the transport conveyor is performed and the choice of an analytical model for the formation of a training data set is theoretically justified. An algorithm for calculating the flow parameters of individual sections of the transport system is proposed. An estimation of the transition period is given. Graphical representation of a data set for training a neural network using an analytical model of a transport system is demonstrated.,"conveyor,flow control,artificial intelligence,dynamic distributed system,ANN model",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,"2020 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES (DESSERT): IOT, BIG DATA AND AI FOR A SAFE & SECURE WORLD AND INDUSTRY 4.0",https://zenodo.org/record/4282907/files/PiKoBof.pdf,
