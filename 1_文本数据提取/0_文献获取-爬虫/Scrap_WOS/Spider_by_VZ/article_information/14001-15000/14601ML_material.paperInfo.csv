1,Soft Robot Control With a Learned Differentiable Model,,,417-423,"Bern James M.,Schnider Yannick,Banzet Pol,Kumar Nitish,Coros Stelian","Bern JM,Schnider Y,Banzet P,Kumar N,Coros S",Bern JM,,"ETH Zurich Switzerland, Inst Intelligent Interact Syst IIIS, Computat Robot Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.","Soft robots are inherently safe and comply readily to their environment. They are therefore exciting for applications like search and rescue or medicine, which involve a high degree of uncertainty, and require interacting with humans. However, the best way to model and control soft robots largely remains an open question. One promising approach is to leverage physically-based modeling techniques such as the finite element method. However, such techniques are inherently limited by their physical assumptions. Indeed, real-world soft robots are often made from unpredictable materials, using imprecise techniques. Data-driven approaches provide an exciting alternative, as they can learn real-world fabrication defects and asymmetries. In this paper we present our first investigation into using machine learning to do soft robot control. We learn a differentiable model of a soft robot's quasi-static physics, and then perform gradient-based optimization to find optimal open-loop control inputs. We find that our learned model captures phenomena that would be absent from an idealized physically-based simulation. We also present practical techniques for acquiring high-quality motion capture data, and observations the effect of network complexity on model accuracy.","Soft robots,Modeling,Control,Learning",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Robotics",,,,2020 3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT ROBOTICS (ROBOSOFT),,

However, to realize high-precision control with such soft actuators and achieve human-like, autonomous, and natural behavioral control, both actuation techniques and sensing technologies require development to make the most of their features. In this regard, McKibben PAMs contain a drawback rooted in the nonlinear mechanical properties of their soft materials, as frictional anisotropy triggered upon PAM actuation between its fibers and the tubes causes hysteresis. Therefore, because the length of PAM is not uniquely determined by the applied pressure, it is generally necessary to install a sensor device (such as a laser displacement meter) for measuring the length in addition to the platform. In this study, we propose a scheme that can estimate a PAM's length using applied pressure and its internal dynamics in real time, making use of the machine learning technique called reservoir computing. We show that estimation can be performed with significantly high accuracy. We subsequently demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust against drastic and immediate changes in platform conditions, and can be adapted dynamically to real-time change. We expect this approach can replace the functionality of the laser displacement meter, freeing the platform from mechanical constraints and leading to the realization of a simpler soft actuator capable of sensing using soft material dynamics.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Robotics",,,,2020 3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT ROBOTICS (ROBOSOFT),,
3,Automatic Classification of Heartbeats Using ECG Signals via Higher Order Hidden Markov Model,,,69-74,"Liao Ying,Xiang Yisha,Du Dongping","Liao Y,Xiang YS,Du DP",Xiang YS,,Texas Tech University System,"Analysis of heartbeat signals is critical to provide information for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases, e.g., beat detection, segmentation and classification based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This paper proposes an automatic heartbeat classification system based on higher order hidden Markov models (HOHMMs). The proposed system consists of four stages: ECG signal preprocessing stage, HOHMM learning stage, decoding stage, and classification stage. The HOHMM extends the basic hidden Markov model (HMM) by allowing the hidden state to depend on its more distant past, which is used to identify heartbeat patterns utilizing the collected ECG data. The learned HOHMMs are then used to decode and classify new heartbeats with unknown types. A case study is conducted to evaluate the classification performance of the proposed system using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. Experimental results show that the developed classification system performs reasonably well, especially for arrhythmia detection.","ECG,heartbeat classification,HOHMM,MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering,Operations Research & Management Science",,,MORPHOLOGY,,,

When the sheet metal is cut in shipbuilding process, the actual dimension of sheet metal will deviate from the design dimension due to the influence of various factors. Therefore, recognizing the pattern of sheet metal cutting data accurately plays a very important role to improve the quality of a ship. In this paper, a method based on XGboost is proposed to recognize the pattern of sheet metal in sheet metal cutting process. By using statistical features and shape features of control chart as the input of the pattern recognition model, the pattern of the variation control chart can be recognized. A comparative study between statistical features, shape features and combined features is implemented, and the practicability of the proposed intelligent method was demonstrated by comparing the pattern recognition effect of Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF) and XGboost.

The reducer in the robot arm is one of its important components but with the highest failure rate. The reducer is a complex system including input shaft, output shaft, gears and bearings, etc. When the reducer starts to be damaged, performance of the robotic arm will be affected, and even worse the system shut down and the production efficiency might be induced, to name only a few. Therefore, how to extend the useful life of the reducer has become an important issue. In general, the clamping jaws (grippers) are installed on the 6th axis in charge of the loading and unloading, which will inevitably higher the reducer failure rate than that of the other 5 axes. Therefore, this research aims at the useful life optimization of the 6th axis reducer. The machine learning algorithms were adopted to establish methodologies to find the key factors. In addition, since the movement path of the robot arm determines the life of the reducer, multiple paths with the same starting and ending position will be generated through the forward and reverse processing, and then the RMSF (Root Mean Squares of Features) values of various paths are calculated. The optimal path with the optimum useful life of the reducer will be the one with the minimum RMSF value. This study has successfully shown that significant differences exist among the various movement paths based on the healthy and abnormal data from the cooperated reducer manufacturing company. This means the developed methodology could be used as an helpful index to extend the useful life of the reducer and also to serve as the basis in futuristic predictive maintenance system.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering,Operations Research & Management Science",,,,,,

In particular, sleep dysfunctions may be the first signs of cognitive frailties for elderly persons. The polysomnography (PSG) is considered the golden standard to perform a comprehensive sleep analysis, as it is based on several sensors placements. However, for longitudinal study of sleep that is required to prevent frailty for elderly persons, such medical equipment is not suitable since it is very invasive. Recent technological advances in sensors allow to gather data with a good precision with less intrusive equipment. The main objective of this study consists in developing a new algorithmic approach to analyse sleep using data from low intrusive sensors. In this study we focus on sleep phase detection, i.e. wake, Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). We consider the following sources of data: heart beat rate, as well as user data such as gender, age, etc. The problem is considered as a supervised classification machine learning problem. We propose a benchmark of several machine learning algorithms and compare their performances against the medical gold standard, the PSG. To do so, we use a data-set collected from a published clinical trial. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm globally outperforms all other methods with a 76.5% agreement with the PSG.

Only in the Salobo Mine, a copper operation in the Amazon forest from Vale S.A., there are more than three and a half kilometers of tailing pipes. Since the material passing through the tailing pipe causes an abrasion effect that could lead to failures, regular inspections are needed. However, given the risky environment to perform manual inspections, a teleoperated or autonomous robot is a crucial tool to keep track of the pipe health. In this work, we propose a deep-learning methodology to process the data stream of images from the robot, aiming to detect early failures directly on the onboard computer of the device in real-time. Multiple architectures of deep-learning image classification were evaluated to detect the anomalies. We validated the early damage detection accuracy and pinpointed the approximate location of the anomalies using the Class Activation Mapping of the networks. Then, we tested the runtime for the network architectures that obtained the best results on different hardware to analyze the need for a GPU onboard in the robot. Moreover, we also trained a Single Shot object Detector to find the boundaries of the pipe joints, which means that the anomaly classification is performed only when a joint is detected.

Since customers cannot physically touch or try out an item before buying it, they must assess its quality from information gathered online. In a typical eCommerce setting, the customer is presented with seller-generated content from the product catalog, such as an image of the product, a textual description, and lists or comparisons of attributes. In addition to catalog attributes, customers often have access to customer-generated content such as reviews and product questions and answers.
In a crowdsourced study, we asked crowd workers to compare product pairs from kitchen, electronics, home, beauty and office categories. In a side-by-side comparison, we asked them to choose the product that is higher quality, and further to identify the attributes that contributed to their judgment, where the attributes were both seller-generated and customer-generated. We find that customers tend to perceive more expensive items as higher quality but that their purchase decisions are uncorrelated with quality, suggesting that customers seek a trade-off between price and quality when making purchase decisions. Crowd workers placed a higher value on attributes derived from customer-generated content such as reviews than on catalog attributes. Among the catalog attributes, brand, item material and pack size(1) were most often selected. Finally, attributes with a low correlation with perceived quality are nonetheless useful in predicting purchases in a machine-learned system.","Product quality,attribute comparison,online reviews",Proceedings Paper,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Computer Science,,,"BRAND-NAME,PERFORMANCE,PRICE",CHIIR'20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CONFERENCE ON HUMAN INFORMATION INTERACTION AND RETRIEVAL,,

However, classifying and detecting CSEM by manual inspection is a high time-consuming task, and most of the time, it is unfeasible in the amount of time available for Spanish police using a search warrant. An option for identifying CSEM is to analyze the names of the files stored in the hard disk of the suspect person, looking in the text for patterns related to CSEM.

Deep learning algorithms have been recently used in this area to deliver a compact and accurate model. Reaching high-level of accuracy requires to store subjects-specific trained models that cannot be achieved with an otherwise compact model trained globally across all subjects. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that closes the gap between these two extreme modeling approaches: we reduce the overall storage requirements by superimposing many subject-specific models into one single model such that it can be reliably decomposed, after retraining, to its constituent models while providing a trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy. Our method makes the use of unexploited capacity of trained models by orthogonalizing parameters in a hyperdimensional space, followed by iterative retraining to compensate noisy decomposition. This method can be applied to various layers of deep inference models. Experimental results on the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset show that our method exploits unutilized capacity for compression and surpasses the accuracy of two state-of-the-art networks: (1) it compresses the smallest network, EEGNet [1], by 1.9x, and increases its accuracy by 2.41% (74.73% vs. 72.32%); (2) using a relatively larger Shallow ConvNet [2], our method achieves 2.95x compression as well as 1.4% higher accuracy (75.05% vs. 73.59%).",CLASSIFICATION,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering",,,CLASSIFICATION,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/20.500.11850/495869/1/bci_superposition.pdf,

The Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been widely used for seizure detection due to its effectiveness in classification tasks, although at the cost of a protracted training time. While Kriging exploits the spatial correlation between data locations, DNN relies on its capacity to learn intrinsic representations within the dataset from the basest unit parts. This paper presents a Distributed Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network (DNN) model as a twofold solution for fast and accurate seizure detection using brain signals collected with the electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy subjects and patients of epilepsy.

Experimental results validate the proposed model as superior to conventional Kriging methods and DNN by training in 91% less time than the basic DNN and about three times as fast as the ordinary Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network (DNN) model while maintaining good performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and testing accuracy compared to other models and existing works.","Smart Healthcare,Edge AI,Seizure Detection,Kriging Methods",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,"EPILEPTIC,SEIZURE",,,

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspection technology is the most common method to identify aging sewer pipes requiring rehabilitation. While these inspections provide essential information on the condition of pipes, assessing all pipes in the network is expensive, and often limited to small portions of an entire sewer system. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to use predictive analytics to leverage existing inspection datasets and then forecast the condition of pipes that have not yet been inspected. The predictive capabilities of machine learning model, namely gradient boosting tree is demonstrated based on data provided by inspection reports from City of Tampa. Three main factors, physical, operational, and environmental were considered during the selection of variables in development of this model. Thirteen independent variables including pipe's age, material, diameter, flow rate, pipe segment length, depth, slope, soil type, pH, sulfate content, water table, soil hydraulic group, and soil corrosivity were used to build the prediction model. Complications posed by imbalance between condition classes are overcome by changing the classification classes into a binary format (where pipes are in either good or critical structural condition) and then the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and confusion matrix were used to measure the performance of the model. The developed model showed 87% accuracy to predict condition of un- inspected sewer pipes.

Material and methods: Two machine learning algorithms including Boosting and Random Forest (RF) as well as threshold BayesA (TBA) and genomic BLUP (GBLUP) were employed. The predictive ability methods were evaluated for different genomic architectures using imputed (i.e. 2.5K, 12.5K and 25K panels) and their original 50K genotypes. We evaluated the three strategies with different rates of disease incidence (including 16%, 50% and 84% threshold points) and their effects on genomic prediction accuracy.
Main results: Genotype imputation performed poorly to estimate the predictive ability of GBLUP, RF, Boosting and TBA methods when using the low-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chip in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) scenarios. The highest predictive ability, when the rate of disease incidence into the training set was 16%, belonged to GBLUP, RF, Boosting and TBA methods. Across different genomic architectures, the Boosting method performed better than TBA, GBLUP and RF methods for all scenarios and proportions of the marker sets imputed. Regarding the changes, the RF resulted in a further reduction compared to Boosting, TBA and GBLUP, especially when the applied data set contained 2.5K panels of the imputed genotypes.

An increase in total blood glucose levels is one of the high-risk factors for CHD occurrence. Therefore, it is important to control glucose regulation and slow down the development of diabetes. Advances in the machine learning approach helps to create a multiclass classifier capable of categorising patients as normal, prediabetic or diabetic based on blood glucose levels. In addition, a modifiable diet based on the classified patient's glucose levels aids in reducing the risk of developing heart disease. This study aims to classify blood glucose levels for CHD risk factors using the highly imbalanced Framingham Heart Study dataset and to identify a suitable dietary plan that reduces the risk of developing CHD. The efficiency of classification depends on the balanced dataset; hence, the proposed study aims to apply effective imbalanced data techniques such as Random Oversampling, SMOTE, SMOTEENN and SMOTETomek to enhance the classification performance. Various imbalanced data techniques with different classifiers are used for investigation. The results suggest that the voting ensemble classifier with the random oversampling technique recorded the highest balanced accuracy, outperforming other classifiers with AUC (73%), specificity (77.45%), sensitivity (72%), F1 measures (78%) and balanced accuracy (67.94%). The proposed study suggests a suitable dietary plan, including preventive tips for normal patients, a low glycaemic diet for prediabetes and a diabetic diet for diabetes patients, which help to reduce the development of CHD risk factors.","Classification algorithms,machine learning,random oversampling,SMOTE,SMOTEENN,SMOTETomek,logistic regression,support vector machine,random forests,multilayer perceptron,voting ensemble classifier",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","Computer Science,Engineering",,,,,,

First, major calcification lesions were detected from an entire pullback using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Second, a SegNet deep learning model with the Tversky loss function was used to segment calcified plaques in the major calcification lesions. The fully connected conditional random field and the frame interpolation of the missing calcification frames were used to reduce classification errors. We trained/tested the networks on a large dataset comprising 8,231 clinical images from 68 patients with 68 vessels and 4,320 ex vivo cadaveric images from 4 hearts with 4 vessels. The 3D CNN model detected major calcifications with high sensitivity (97.7%), specificity (87.7%), and F1 score (0.922). Compared to the standard one-step approach, our two-step deep learning approach significantly improved sensitivity (from 77.5% to 86.2%), precision (from 73.5% to 75.8%), and F1 score (from 0.749 to 0.781). We investigated segmentation performance for varying numbers of training samples; at least 3,900 images were required to obtain stable segmentation results. We also found very small differences in calcification attributes (e.g., angle, thickness, and depth) and identical calcium scores on repetitive pullbacks, indicating excellent reproducibility. Applied to new clinical pullbacks, our method has implications for real-time treatment planning and imaging research.","Image segmentation,Deep learning,Lesions,Three-dimensional displays,Heart,Training,Sensitivity,Intravascular optical coherence tomography,coronary calcified plaque,major calcification,two-step deep learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"OPTICAL,COHERENCE,TOMOGRAPHY,ATHEROSCLEROTIC,PLAQUES,CLASSIFICATION",IEEE ACCESS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7885992,

Implants have a 10-15-year lifespan with up to 30% of revision surgeries showing complications with osteomyelitis. Titanium and titanium alloys are the favored implant materials because they are lightweight and have high mechanical strength. However, this increased strength can be associated with decreased bone density around the implant, leading to implant loosening and failure. To avoid this, current strategies include plasma-spraying titanium surfaces and foaming titanium. Both techniques give the titanium a rough and irregular finish that improves biocompatibility. Recently, researchers have also sought to surface-conjugate proteins to titanium to induce osteointegration. Cell adhesion-promoting proteins can be conjugated to methacrylate groups and crosslinked using a variety of methods. Methacrylated proteins can be conjugated to titanium surfaces through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). However, surface conjugation of proteins increases biocompatibility non-specifically to bone cells, adding to the risk of biofouling which may result in osteomyelitis that causes implant failure. In this work, we analyze the factors contributing to biofouling when coating titanium to improve biocompatibility, and design an experimental scheme to evaluate optimal coating parameters.","titanium coating,implanted medical devices,biomaterials,surface chemistry,chemical descriptors,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,2.943,"COLLAGEN,ATRP,HIP",MICROMACHINES,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7019220?pdf=render,

It consists of using the deep learning method U-Net to segment the thermal images. U-Net is trained by combining the two types of images (thermal and color) given by the thermal camera FLIR ONE Pro. Results show that this multimodal approach performs better than the one using only thermal images, especially for difficult cases. The second part is devoted to a transversal clinical study conducted within the Hospital National Dos de Mayo in Lima, Peru. 122 type II diabetic patients without ulcer were recruited. These individuals were classified into three risk groups of developing a foot ulcer. This classification is based on a medical examination: a low-risk group (R0), a medium-risk group (R1) and finally a high-risk group (R2). The study reveals that the average temperature of the plantar foot is 1 degrees C higher in R1 than in R0 (p<0.1). The R1 group patients are characterized by a rapid recovery of their initial temperature after the cold stress test, compared to R0 and R2 (p<0.01). Finally, the mean absolute point-to-point temperature difference between left and right foot is lower in R1 than in R2 (p<0.1).

Unlike compressed sensing, the image redundancies that are captured by these models are not well understood. The lack of theoretical understanding also makes it challenging to choose the sampling pattern that would yield the best possible recovery. To overcome these challenges, we propose to optimize the sampling patterns and the parameters of the reconstruction block in a model-based deep learning framework. We show that the joint optimization by the model-based strategy results in improved performance than direct inversion CNN schemes due to better decoupling of the effect of sampling and image properties.

Methods: We developed a deep archetypal analysis to identify patterns of glaucomatous vision loss, and then projected visual fields over the identified patterns. Projections provided a representation that was more accurate in detecting glaucomatous vision loss, thus, more appropriate for recognizing preclinical signs of glaucoma prior to disease development. To overcome the class imbalance in prediction, we implemented a class-balanced bagging with neural networks. Results: Using original visual field as features of the class-balanced bagging Classification provided an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.55 for predicting glaucoma approximately four years prior to disease development. Using convex representation of the visual fields as input features provided an AUC of 0.61 while using deep convex representation as input features improved the AUC to 0.71. Relevance vector machine (RVM) achieved an AUC of 0.64. Conclusion: Deep archetypal analysis representation of visual functional features with balanced bagging classification could serve as an automated tool for predicting glaucoma. Significance: Glaucoma is the second leading cause of worldwide blindness. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain, delaying diagnosis in many patients until they reach late irreversible vision loss stages.

First, squeeze-and-excitation is similar to the concept of attention on different channels, so it can combine variants of extracted features. Second, a pre-processing step to enhance an image's quality is proposed by applying a computer vision technique called ""contrast limit adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)"". The experiment was conducted on two benchmarks: MICCAI2017 and 2018 datasets and evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient and Jaccard index scores. The results showed that our model outperformed a baseline technique, AlbuNet, on both datasets.","Angiodysplasia,Deep learning,Medical image semantic segmentation,Convolutional neural network",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,,,,,

Differential diagnosis of malignant and benign melanoma is a challenging task even for specialist dermatologists. The diagnostic performance of melanoma has significantly improved with the use of images obtained via dermoscopy devices. With the recent advances in medical image processing field, it is possible to improve the dermatological diagnostic performance by using computer-assisted diagnostic systems. For this purpose, various machine learning algorithms are designed and tested to be used in the diagnosis of melanoma. Deep learning models, which have gained popularity in recent years, have been effective in solving image recognition and classification problems. Concurrently with these developments, studies on the classification of dermoscopic images using CNN models are being performed. In this study, the performance of AlexNet, GoogLeNet and Resnet50 CNNs were examined for the classification problem of benign and malignant melanoma cancers on dermoscopic images. Dermoscopic images of 19373 benign and 2197 malignant lesions obtained from ISIC database were used in the experiments. All three CNNs, which were the former winners of the ImageNet competition, have been reconfigured to perform binary classification. In the experiments 80% of the images were used for training and the remaining 20% were used for validation. All experiments were performed with the same parameters for each CNN models. According to the experiments ResNET50 model achieved the best performance with 92.81% classification accuracy and AlexNet was first-ranked in terms of the time complexity measurements. The development of new models based on existing CNN models with a focus on dermoscopic images will be the subject of future studies.","Melanoma,Benign and Malignant lesion classification,Deep learning,Convolutional neural networks,AlexNet,GoogLeNet,ResNet",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,,"DIAGNOSIS,ACCURACY,TELEDERMATOLOGY,PATHOLOGISTS",,,

A neural network was trained in an unsupervised manner using an autoencoder to learn the diffusion MRI signal subspace.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method to generate complete and scarce plant lesion leaf images to improve the recognition accuracy of the classification network. The advantages of our study include: (i) proposing a binary generator network to solve the problem of how a generative adversarial network (GAN) generates a lesion image with a specific shape and (ii) using the edge-smoothing and image pyramid algorithm to solve the problem that occurs when synthesizing a complete lesion leaf image where the synthetic edge pixels are different and the network output size is fixed but the real lesion size is random.

Mobile learning enhances collaborative learning as learners can access information and learning materials from anywhere and at any time. However, supporting efficient mobile learning in education is a critical challenge. In addition, incorporating technological and educational components becomes a new, complex dimension. In this paper, an efficient collaborative mobile-learning architecture based on mobile agents is proposed to enhance learning activity and to allow teachers and students to collaborate in knowledge and information transfer. A mobile agent can control its own actions, is able to communicate with other agents, and adapts in accordance with previous experience. The proposed model consists of four components: the learner agent, the teacher agent, the device agent and the social agent. The social agent plays the main role in the collaborative tasks since it is responsible for evaluating the collaborative interactions among different learners. Additionally, it offers an evaluation indicator for the learners' collaboration and supplies the teacher with learner's collaboration reports. The proposed model is evaluated by introducing a collaborative mobile-learning case study applied to two full classes of undergraduate students. To conduct the model experiments, students were asked to complete a questionnaire after they used the proposed model. The questionnaire results statistically revealed that the proposed architecture is easy to use and access, well-organized, convenient, and facilitates the learning process. The students thought the proposed m-learning application should complement rather than replace the traditional lectures. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed collaborative mobile learning model enhances the learner's skills in problem solving, increases the learner's knowledge in comparison with individual learning, and social agent encourages learners for more participation in the learning tasks. Based on the experiments conducted, the authors found that the proposed model can improve the quality of the learning process by assessing learners' and groups' collaboration, and it can help teachers make learners improve how they work in groups. This also provides various ways of assessing learners abilities and skills in groups. It is also possible to integrate the collaborative e-learning with the proposed collaborative m-learning.","mobile learning,m-learning,collaborative learning,improving classroom teaching,mobile agents,case study",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,2.408,MODEL,ELECTRONICS,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/1/162/pdf,

The influence of the sample size and the previous sEMG data on the prediction efficiency was analyzed. The estimation model was not sensitive to the sample size when samples increased to a certain value, and the results of different previous sEMG showed that the prediction accuracy of the estimation models did not always improve with the increasing features of input. By comparing the estimation model of back propagation neural network with principal component analysis (BPPCA), it was found that RFPCA was suitable for all participants in the experiment with less execution time, and the root mean square error was around 5 degrees which was lower than BPPCA with errors varying from 7 degrees to 25 degrees.

Intelligent tutoring systems can potentially facilitate this work for teachers by supporting the automatic adaptation of examples based on a student model of the induction process. However, current models of inductive reasoning usually lack two main characteristics helpful to adaptive learning environments, individual differences of students and tracing of students' learning as they receive feedback. In this paper, we describe a model to predict and simulate inductive reasoning of students for a categorization task. Our approach uses a Bayesian model for describing the reasoning processes of students. This model allows us to predict students' choices in categorization questions by accounting for their feature biases. Using data gathered from 222 students categorizing three topics, we find that our model has a 75% accuracy, which is 10% greater than a baseline model. Our model is a contribution to learning analytics by enabling us to assign different bias profiles to individual students and tracking these profile changes over time through which we can gain a better understanding of students' learning processes. This model may be relevant for systematically analysing students' differences and evolution in inductive reasoning strategies while supporting the design of adaptive inductive learning environments.","Inductive Reasoning,Student Modeling,Adaptive Learning Environment,Process Mining",Proceedings Paper,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","Computer Science,Education & Educational Research",,,,LAK20: THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LEARNING ANALYTICS & KNOWLEDGE,,

Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial use of eye-tracking in domains such as neurological and neuropsychiatric testing, advertising evaluation, pilot training, and automotive safety. Remote eye-tracking on a smartphone could enable the significant growth in the deployment of applications in these domains. Our system uses a 3D gaze-estimation model that enables accurate point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation with free head and device motion. To accurately determine the input eye features (pupil center and corneal reflections), the system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) together with a novel center-of-mass output layer. The use of CNNs improves the system's robustness to the significant variability in the appearance of eye-images found in handheld eye trackers. The system was tested with 8 subjects with the device free to move in their hands and produced a gaze bias of 0.72 degrees. Our hybrid approach that uses artificial illumination, a 3D gaze-estimation model, and a CNN feature extractor achieved an accuracy that is significantly (400%) better than current eye-tracking systems on smartphones that use natural illumination and machine-learning techniques to estimate the PoG.","eye-tracking,gaze estimation,smartphone,convolutional neural network,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"GAZE,ESTIMATION,MOVEMENTS,ATTENTION,DISORDER,IMPACT,SCHIZOPHRENIA,BLINDNESS",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/2/543/pdf,

One of the drawbacks of deep architectures is the large amount of annotated data required for an effective training. Usually, in Machine Learning this problem is mitigated by the usage of semi-supervised methods or, more recently, by using Transfer Learning, in the context of deep architectures. One recent promising method to enable semi-supervised learning in deep architectures has been formalized within Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (SS-GANs) in the context of Computer Vision. In this paper, we adopt the SS-GAN framework to enable semi-supervised learning in the context of NLP. We demonstrate how an SS-GAN can boost the performances of simple architectures when operating in expressive low-dimensional embeddings; these are derived by combining the unsupervised approximation of linguistic Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and the so-called Universal Sentence Encoders. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach over a semantic classification task, i.e., Question Classification, by considering different sizes of training material and different numbers of target classes. By applying such adversarial schema to a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron, a classifier trained over a subset derived from 1% of the original training material achieves 92% of accuracy. Moreover, when considering a complex classification schema, e.g., involving 50 classes, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives such as BERT.","Semi-supervised learning,generative adversarial network,kernel-based embedding spaces,universal sentence encoding",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,"NYSTROM,METHOD",INTELLIGENZA ARTIFICIALE,,

Multiple modalities are often used for disease diagnosis and quantification. Two approaches are widely used in the literature to fuse multiple modalities in the segmentation networks: early-fusion (which stacks multiple modalities as different input channels) and late-fusion (which fuses the segmentation results from different modalities at the very end). These fusion methods easily suffer from the cross-modal interference caused by the input modalities which have wide variations. To address the problem, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely OctopusNet, to better leverage and fuse the information contained in multi-modalities. The proposed framework employs a separate encoder for each modality for feature extraction and exploits a hyper-fusion decoder to fuse the extracted features while avoiding feature explosion. We evaluate the proposed OctopusNet on two publicly available datasets, i.e. ISLES-2018 and MRBrainS-2013. The experimental results show that our framework outperforms the commonly-used feature fusion approaches and yields the state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.","Medical image segmentation,Deep learning,Multi-modal images",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02031,

Firstly, we employ wavelet denoising method to improve the signal-noise rate (SNR) of aEEG signal. Then, to reduce the high dimensionality of aEEG signals while retaining the essential information, we extract global and local features from aEEG signals based on visual features and entropy. Thereafter, we process our data with a feature augmentation algorithm to obtain an extended data set. Finally, an ensemble algorithm is utilized to perform seizure detection.

We designed a spatial attentive Bayesian deep learning network for the automatic segmentation of the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) of the prostate with uncertainty estimation. The proposed method was evaluated by using internal and external independent testing datasets, and overall uncertainties of the proposed model were calculated at different prostate locations (apex, middle, and base). The study cohort included 351 MRI scans, of which 304 scans were retrieved from a de-identified publicly available datasets (PROSTATEX) and 47 scans were extracted from a large U.S. tertiary referral center (external testing dataset; ETD)). All the PZ and TZ contours were drawn by research fellows under the supervision of expert genitourinary radiologists. Within the PROSTATEX dataset, 259 and 45 patients (internal testing dataset; ITD) were used to develop and validate the model. Then, the model was tested independently using the ETD only. The segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). For PZ and TZ segmentation, the proposed method achieved mean DSCs of 0.80 +/- 0.05 and 0.89 +/- 0.04 on ITD, as well as 0.79 +/- 0.06 and 0.87 +/- 0.07 on ETD. For both PZ and TZ, there was no significant difference between ITD and ETD for the proposed method. This DL-based method enabled the accuracy of the PZ and TZ segmentation, which outperformed the state-of-art methods (DeeplabV3+, Attention U-Net, R2U-Net, USE-Net and U-Net). We observed that segmentation uncertainty peaked at the junction between PZ, TZ and AFS.

In other words, it is the response capability of food swallowing to avoid choking and aspiration. Herein, we focus on the coordination of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles activities, which are closely related to swallowing movement, as a first step to develop a method to evaluate swallowing reserve, which declines due to neuromuscular disease, muscle weakness caused by aging, to mention a few. First, using two 22-channel electrodes, we measured the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles during the following four swallowing conditions: combining two bolus volumes (3 and 15 mL water) and two techniques (normal and effortful swallow). Then, we verified whether the difference in swallowing patterns based on swallowing conditions can be classified from sEMG signals using three machine learning methods; namely, the real-time classification, comprehensive classification, and image recognition method. In the real-time classification method, the mean classification accuracy (MCA) for the four swallowing conditions was as low as 81.5%, indicating that the difference between swallowing conditions performed in a period of approximately 1 s cannot be classified sufficiently by this method. In the comprehensive classification method that applies a majority decision to all the classification results from the start to the end of swallowing, which can be obtained every 16 ms, MCA was 95.1%. Furthermore, in the image recognition method, the change of a series of sEMG signals in the swallowing movement was converted into swallowing pattern image, and the images were classified using a combination of deep convolutional neural networks and support vector machine (SVM). Compared with the comprehensive classification method, the number of training samples for the image recognition method was only 1/26, but the MCA reached 95.7%. This method, which can noninvasively evaluate swallowing patterns that change slightly based on swallowing conditions, could be applied to early detection of reduced swallowing function or a state of frailty (dysphagia potential) in aged individuals.","swallowing,pattern classification,suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles,surface EMG signals",Article,"JAPANESE SOC MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, JAPANESE SOC MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, TOKY, BUNKYO-KU 112-0012, JAPAN",Engineering,,,"STRUCTURAL,DISPLACEMENTS,BOLUS,VOLUME,MOTION",ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/9/0/9_9_10/_pdf,

In this study, we used a hyperspectral imager (HSI), which can measure color information in detail, to develop an automated melanoma diagnosis system. In recent years, the effectiveness of deep learning has become more widely accepted in the field of image recognition. We therefore integrated the deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning into our system. We tried data augmentation to demonstrate how our system improves diagnostic performance. 283 melanoma lesions and 336 non-melanoma lesions were used for the analysis. The data measured by HSI, called the hyperspectral data (HSD), were converted to a single-wavelength image averaged over plus or minus 3 nm. We used GoogLeNet which was pre-trained by ImageNet and then was transferred to analyze the HSD. In the transfer learning, we used not only the original HSD but also artificial augmentation dataset to improve the melanoma classification performance of GoogLeNet. Since GoogLeNet requires three-channel images as input, three wavelengths were selected from those single-wavelength images and assigned to three channels in wavelength order from short to long. The sensitivity and specificity of our system were estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The results of a combination of 530, 560, and 590 nm (combination A) and 500, 620, and 740 nm (combination B) were compared. We also compared the diagnostic performance with and without the data augmentation. All images were augmented by inverting the image vertically and/or horizontally. Without data augmentation, the respective sensitivity and specificity of our system were 77.4% and 75.6% for combination A and 73.1% and 80.6% for combination B. With data augmentation, these numbers improved to 79.9% and 82.4% for combination A and 76.7% and 82.2% for combination B. From these results, we conclude that the diagnostic performance of our system has been improved by data augmentation. Furthermore, our system succeeds to differentiate melanoma with a sensitivity of almost 80%.","melanoma,hyperspectral imager,deep learning,transfer learning,data augmentation",Article; Proceedings Paper,"JAPANESE SOC MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, JAPANESE SOC MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, TOKY, BUNKYO-KU 112-0012, JAPAN",Engineering,,,CANCER,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/9/0/9_9_62/_pdf,

The objective of this study was to analyze AFAP's long-term performance and predict its snow-melting ability. Two types of anti-freezing stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixtures (SMA-13 with Iceguard and SMA-13 with Mafilon) were prepared with the Marshall method. Water stability, high-temperature stability, low-temperature crack resistance, and freeze-thaw split tests were conducted to evaluate mixtures' performance. Meanwhile, the effect of anti-freezing filler, asphalt content, and soaking temperature on the salt dissolution of anti-freezing asphalt mixtures was analyzed, and the snow-melting ability of AFAP was predicted based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network. The results illustrated that water stability of anti-icing asphalt mixture reduced, and the dynamic stability after short-term aging was improved. The tensile strain and tensile strength ratio of the anti-icing asphalt mixture reduced after long-term aging and soaking in water. In addition, the salt dissolution rate increased with the increase of anti-freezing filler content and the decrease of asphalt content. The research conducted suggests that the BP Neural Network can be utilized to predict the snow-melting ability of the anti-freezing asphalt mixture, and the regression coefficient of the predicted and measured salt dissolution was higher.","anti-freezing,asphalt pavement,artificial neural networks,back propagation training algorithm,prediction of salt dissolution,long-term performance",Article,"AMER SOC TESTING MATERIALS, 100 BARR HARBOR DR, W CONSHOHOCKEN, PA 19428-2959 USA",Materials Science,,,"NEURAL-NETWORK,CONCRETE,MIXTURES,PREDICTION,FILLER,TIME",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS,,

L.","Lu Y,Fu XH,Chen FX,Wong KKL",Wong KKL,10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101748,Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Obstetric ultrasound examination of physiological parameters has been mainly used to estimate the fetal weight during pregnancy and baby weight before labour to monitor fetal growth and reduce prenatal morbidity and mortality. However, the problem is that ultrasound estimation of fetal weight is subject to population's difference, strict operating requirements for sonographers, and poor access to ultrasound in low-resource areas. Inaccurate estimations may lead to negative perinatal outcomes. This study aims to predict fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination within a certain accuracy. We consider that machine learning can provide an accurate estimation for obstetricians alongside traditional clinical practices, as well as an efficient and effective support tool for pregnant women for self-monitoring. We present a robust methodology using a data set comprising 4212 intrapartum recordings. The cubic spline function is used to fit the curves of several key characteristics that are extracted from ultrasound reports. A number of simple and powerful machine leaming algorithms are trained, and their performance is evaluated with real test data. We also propose a novel evaluation performance index called the intersection-over-union (loU) for our study. The results are encouraging using an ensemble model consisting of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms. The experimental results show the loU between predicted range of fetal weight at any gestational age that is given by the ensemble model and ultrasound respectively. The machine learning based approach applied in our study is able to predict, with a high accuracy, fetal weight at varying gestational age in the absence of ultrasound examination.","Ensemble learning,Fetal weight estimation,Genetic algorithm,Intersection-over-union,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Medical Informatics",,5.602,"INTERNATIONAL,STANDARDS,SONOGRAPHIC,ESTIMATION,INTRAUTERINE,GROWTH,BIRTH-WEIGHT,RESTRICTION,RECOGNITION,HEAD",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,

Elderly and disabled people are the most affected by this fast growing disease. Hence, an accurate diagnosis of pressure injuries is paramount for efficient treatment. The characteristics of these wounds are crucial indicators for the progress of the healing. While invasive methods to retrieve information are not only painful to the patients but may also increase the risk of infections, non-invasive techniques by means of imaging systems provide a better monitoring of the wound healing processes without causing any harm to the patients. These systems should include an accurate segmentation of the wound, the classification of its tissue types, the metrics including the diameter, area and volume, as well as the healing evaluation. Therefore, the aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview of imaging techniques for the analysis and monitoring of pressure injuries as an aid to their diagnosis, and proof of the efficiency of Deep Learning to overcome this problem and even outperform the previous methods. In this paper, 114 out of 199 papers retrieved from 8 databases have been analyzed, including also contributions on chronic wounds and skin lesions.","Pressure injury,Wound image analysis,Deep learning",Review,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Medical Informatics",,5.602,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,TISSUE,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,MODEL,DIAGNOSIS,FRAMEWORK,CARE",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,
