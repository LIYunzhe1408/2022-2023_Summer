1,Applications and challenges of deep learning in material microscopic image analysis,28,3,68-75,",,","Ban Xiaojuan,Su Yanjing,Xie Jianxin",,,Ban Xiaojuan,"The structure of materials is mainly affected by the composition and processing technology,which is the key factor to determine the performance of materials and plays an important role in the whole cycle of material research and development. The material microstructure is presented in the form of unstructured image data,which is usually analyzed and extracted by means of artificial experience,leaving out a lot of material information and implicit knowledge. The development and application of deep learning technology provide an important research means for the accurate, fast, and automatic acquisition of information in material microscopic image. In this work,the main research contents and key technologies of material microscopic image processing and information mining were summarized from three aspects of image processing,image analysis,and image understanding. The research progress of deep learning in image recognition,image segmentation,and image generation in image analysis was introduced in detail. The development directions and challenges for the application of deep learning in material microscopic image analysis and information mining were also discussed.","material, microscopic image analysis; ,machine learning,; deep learning; computer vision; image processing",Article,,,,,,,,
2,Solving the electronic structure problem with machine learning,4,4,43-49,",,,,,","Chandrasekaran Anand,Kamal Deepak,Batra Rohit,Kim Chiho,Chen Lihua,Ramprasad Rampi",,,Chandrasekaran Anand,"Simulations based on solving the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation of density functional theory (DFT) have become a vital component of modern materials and chemical sciences research and development portfolios. Despite its versatility, routine DFT calculations are usually limited to a few hundred atoms due to the computational bottleneck posed by the KS equation. Here we introduce a machine-learning-based scheme to efficiently assimilate the function of the KS equation, and by-pass it to directly, rapidly, and accurately predict the electronic structure of a material or a molecule, given just its atomic configuration. A new rotationally invariant representation is utilized to map the atomic environment around a grid-point to the electron density and local density of states at that grid-point. This mapping is learned using a neural network trained on previously generated reference DFT results at millions of grid-points. The proposed paradigm allows for the high-fidelity emulation of KS DFT, but orders of magnitude faster than the direct solution. Moreover, the machine learning prediction scheme is strictly linear-scaling with system size.",,Article,,,,,,,,
3,Analyzing machine learning models to accelerate generation of fundamental materials insights,4,4,135-143,",,,,,","Umehara Mitsutaro,Stein Helge S,Guevarra Dan,Newhouse Paul F,Boyd David A,Gregoire John M",,,Umehara Mitsutaro,"Machine learning for materials science envisions the acceleration of basic science research through automated identification of key data relationships to augment human interpretation and gain scientific understanding. A primary role of scientists is extraction of fundamental knowledge from data, and we demonstrate that this extraction can be accelerated using neural networks via analysis of the trained data model itself rather than its application as a prediction tool. Convolutional neural networks excel at modeling complex data relationships in multi-dimensional parameter spaces, such as that mapped by a combinatorial materials science experiment. Measuring a performance metric in a given materials space provides direct information about (locally) optimal materials but not the underlying materials science that gives rise to the variation in performance. By building a model that predicts performance (in this case photoelectrochemical power generation of a solar fuels photoanode) from materials parameters (in this case composition and Raman signal), subsequent analysis of gradients in the trained model reveals key data relationships that are not readily identified by human inspection or traditional statistical analyses. Human interpretation of these key relationships produces the desired fundamental understanding, demonstrating a framework in which machine learning accelerates data interpretation by leveraging the expertize of the human scientist. We also demonstrate the use of neural network gradient analysis to automate prediction of the directions in parameter space, such as the addition of specific alloying elements, that may increase performance by moving beyond the confines of existing data.",,Article,,,,,,,,

Among many indicators in learners' monitoring, self-efficacy lies at the center of Bandura's social cognitive theory but still remains a significant challenge in setting an effective and reliable evaluation model. Thereby, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, rather than traditional subjective measurement, to evaluate three levels of academic self-efficacy more objectively and precisely. Firstly, we collected academic self-efficacy scales from a cohort of 39 students exposed to three learning tasks of different difficulties and recorded corresponding EEG signals simultaneously. The acquired EEG data were then processed by pass-band filter and baseline drift removal. Subsequently, five features were extracted from the preprocessed EEG data and linked as feature sequences before sending into classifier. Then, using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network as the classification algorithm, we adjusted the number of hidden layers and LSTM units in each layer to observe their influence in performance. Finally, the proposed model achieves the accuracy of 95.06%.

A reduction in costs by reducing rejection rate by only 5-10 pieces per year already amortizes costs for data-acquisition hardware for online process monitoring. The grinding wheel wear, one of the major influencing factors responsible for the grinding burn, depends on a large number of influencing variables like cooling lubricant, feed rate, circumferential wheel speed and wheel topography. In the past, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have proven effective for the predictive analysis of process quality. In addition to predictive analysis, AI-based applications for process control may raise the resilience of machining processes. Using machine learning methods may also lead to a heavy reduction of cost amassed due to a physical inspection of each workpiece. With this contribution, information from previous works is leveraged and an AI-based framework for adaptive process control of a cylindrical grinding process is introduced. For the development of such a framework, three research objectives have been derived: First, the dynamic wheel wear needs to be modelled and measured, because of its strong impact on the resulting workpiece quality. Second, models to predict the quality features of the produced workpieces depending on process setup parameters and materials used have to be established. Here, special focus is set on deriving models that are independent of a specific wheel-workpiece-pair. The opportunity to use such a model in a variety of grinding configurations gives the production line consistent process support. Third, the resilience of analytical models regarding graceful degradation of sensors needs to be tackled, since the stability of such systems has to be guaranteed to be used in productive environments. Process resilience against human errors and sensor failures leads to a minimization of rejection costs in production. To do so, a framework is presented, where virtual sensors, upon the failure or detection of an erroneous signal from physical sensors, will be activated and provide signals to the downstream smart systems until the process is completed or the physical sensor is changed.","Cylindrical Grinding,Wheel Wear,Virtual Sensors,Process Resilience,Artificial Intelligence",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,SURFACE,2020 IEEE 18TH WORLD SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATICS (SAMI 2020),,

A high Pt loading is often required to achieve a practical power density in fuel cells, thus leading to high costs and limited applications. Meanwhile, the high Pt loading promotes aggregation during cycling under harsh electrocatalytic conditions, which reduces the surface area of the catalyst and leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. The formation of alloy or intermetallic nanocrystals via the addition of non-precious metals along with precious metals is one strategy to effectively reduce the cost. Due to the electronic and geometric effects introduced by the non-precious metals, the catalytic performance of these bimetallic nanocrystals can be retained or even improved. Compared to the metallic alloy nanocrystals, the intermetallic ones are more stable in critical catalytic conditions. Due to their highly ordered structures, Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals are widely used as electrode materials for various electrocatalytic reactions in fuel cells, and they show high stability against oxidation and etching. PtCo intermetallic nanocrystals have attained performances that exceed the 2020 target of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Pt activity and stability for the cathode reaction of fuel cells (oxygen reduction reaction). Decreasing the size of intermetallic compounds to the nanometer scale can significantly increase their active site densities due to the large specific surface area. However, the preparation of intermetallic nanocrystals is more complicated than that of alloys. Therefore, to further improve the electrocatalytic properties of intermetallic nanocrystals, an in-depth study of the factors affecting the electrocatalytic properties of nanocrystals is necessary. This review summarizes recent advances in Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals. First, we highlight the controlled synthesis strategies, including direct liquid-phase synthesis, the thermal annealing approach, and chemical vapor deposition. Of these strategies, direct liquid-phase synthesis is the most common approach to prepare the intermetallic nanocrystals. Second, the diverse potential applications of different electrocatalytic reactions are summarized. The reactions include the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), as well as the oxidation reactions of formic acid (FAOR), methanol (MOR), and ethanol (EtOR). Of these reactions, ORR is the most important, and it has been widely studied. Some advanced characterization techniques and machine learning research based on density functional theory (DFT) are also mentioned. Finally, the challenges and the future perspectives of intermetallic nanocrystals are outlined.","Platinum-based intermetallic compounds,Nanocrystals,Controlled synthesis,Structure-ordered,Electrocatalytic reactions",Review,"PEKING UNIV PRESS, PEKING UNIV, CHEMISTRY BUILDING, BEIJING 100871, PEOPLES R CHINA",Chemistry,,1.218,"OXYGEN,REDUCTION,REACTION,CORE-SHELL,NANOPARTICLES,TUNING,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,MEMBRANE,FUEL-CELLS,FORMIC-ACID,METHANOL,OXIDATION,ETHANOL,ELECTROOXIDATION,HYDROGEN,ADSORPTION,ENHANCED,ACTIVITY,SURFACE-STRUCTURE",ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA,http://www.whxb.pku.edu.cn/CN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=35713,

WSIs can greatly improve the workflow of pathologists through the development of novel image analytics software for automatic detection of cellular and morphological features and disease diagnosis using histopathology slides. However, the gigabyte size of a WSI poses a serious challenge for storage and retrieval of millions of WSIs. In this paper, we propose a system for scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of image tiles using DRAM. A WSI is partitioned into tiles and sub-tiles using a combination of a space-filling curve, recursive partitioning, and Dewey numbering. They are then stored as a collection of key-value pairs in DRAM. During retrieval, a tile is fetched using key-value lookups from DRAM. Through performance evaluation on a 24-node cluster using 100 WSIs, we observed that, compared to Apache Spark, our system was three times faster to store the 100 WSIs and 1,000 times faster to access a single tile achieving millisecond latency. Such fast access to tiles is highly desirable when developing deep learning-based image analytics solutions on millions of WSIs.","Whole slide imaging,scalable storage,fast retrieval,DRAM,image analytics",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Optics",,,PATHOLOGY,,,

The feasibility of using multispectral imaging combined with one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to classify pepper seed varieties was studied. The total number of three varieties of samples was 1472, and the average spectral curve between 365nm and 970nm of the three varieties was studied. The data were analyzed using full bands of the spectrum or the feature bands selected by successive projection algorithm (SPA). SPA extracted 9 feature bands from 19 bands (430, 450, 470, 490, 515, 570, 660, 780, and 880 nm). The classification accuracy of the three classification models developed with full band using K nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SUM), and 1D-CNN were 85.81%, 97.70%, and 90.50%, respectively. With full bands, SUM and 1D-CNN performed significantly better than KNN, and SVM performed slightly better than 1D-CNN. With feature bands, the testing accuracies of SUM and 1D-CNN were 97.30% and 92.6%, respectively.

Segmentation allows a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the knee cartilage from the required morphological point of view and is an essential aspect of the clinical evaluation of knee osteoarthritis as it makes early diagnosis of pathological changes in the cartilage possible. This segmentation of the cartilage is often conducted manually or is done using various semi-automatic segmentation approaches that make the results of this segmentation not easily reproducible due to intra and inter observer variations. Given that the segmentation of AC is challenging due to its changing anatomical structure, semi-automatic segmentation methods have shown better technical advantages in terms of reliance on training data and user interactions. Conventional semi-automatic segmentation models require a large amount of user interaction; making them less ideal for real-time use in CAD systems. In recognition of this limitation, we propose a hybrid segmentation model combining random walkers with deep learning-based initialisation and level set based refinements of the segmented cartilage boundary.

It happens when abnormal fibrovascular tissues grow towards the pupil region. It can cause vision problems if the tissues fully obstruct light from coming into the retina. Thus, the disease must be detected as early as possible so that the mitigation steps can be administered before it is too late. However, most of the fishermen are not aware of the pterygium existence. Therefore, an online screening tool should be developed to help them doing screening by themselves just by using a mobile phone. Taking inspiration from this need, an automatic pterygium tissue segmentation is proposed using a deep learning approach. The goal is to extract the right size of the pterygium infected tissues so that the users are aware of their disease severity level. The proposed method uses DeepLab V1 and DeepLab V2 as the foundation, in which densely connected layers are integrated to improve the segmentation performance. A set of four feedforward layers is added to the existing DeepLab architectures with the aim of reducing the zero gradient diminishing problem. Both DeepLab V1 and V2 have recorded performance improvement in terms of mean accuracy (acc) and mean intersection over union (IoU). Densely connected DeepLab V2 obtains the best testing results with acc and IoU of 0.9202 and 0.8381, respectively.

Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology that develops years prior to clinical manifestations and typically preceded by prodromal stages such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Currently, the manual diagnostic procedures of both types are time consuming, following certain clinical criteria and neuropsychological examinations. Our study aims to establish state-of-the-art performance in the automatic identification of different dementia etiologies, including AD, MCI, and Possible AD (PoAD), and to determine whether patients with initial cognitive declines exhibit language deficits through the analysis of language samples deduced with the cookie theft picture description task. Data was derived from the cookie theft picture corpus of DementiaBank, from which all language samples of the identified etiologies were used, with a random subsampling technique that handles the skewness of the classes. Several original lexical and syntactic (i.e., lexicosyntactic) features were introduced and used alongside previously established lexicosyntactics to train machine learning (ML) classifiers against these etiologies. Further, a statistical analysis was conducted to uncover the deficiency across these etiologies. Our models resulted in benchmarks for differentiating all the identified classes with accuracies ranging between 95 to 98% and corresponding F1 values falling between 94 and 98%. The statistical analysis of our lexicosyntactic biomarkers shows that linguistic deviations are associated with prodromal as well as advanced neurodegenerative pathologies, being greatly impacted as cognitive decline increases and suggesting that language biomarkers may aid the early diagnosis of these pathologies.","Dementia,Feature extraction,Support vector machines,Linguistics,Syntactics,Acoustics,Task analysis,Alzheimer&#8217,s disease,prodromal dementia,cognitive decline,clinical diagnosis,neurolinguistics,machine learning,prediction,feature selection",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"MILD,COGNITIVE,IMPAIRMENT,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,FEATURE-SELECTION,NARRATIVE,SPEECH,EARLY-STAGE,LANGUAGE,PERFORMANCE,RECOGNITION,DIAGNOSIS,MOCA",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09218925.pdf,

Worldwide, 1.6 millions of hip fractures occur every year and are expected to rise to 6.3 millions in 2050. The current gold standard to assess fracture risk is the Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), which provides a projected image of the bone from which areal bone mineral density is extracted. Ultrasound techniques have been proposed as non invasive alternatives. Recently, estimates of cortical thickness and porosity, obtained by Bi-Directional Axial Transmission (BDAT) in a pilot clinical study, have been shown to be associated with non-traumatic fractures in post menopausal women. Cortical parameters were derived from the comparison between experimental and theoretical guided modes. This model-based inverse approach failed for the patients associated with poor guided mode information. Moreover, even if the fracture discrimination ability was found similar to DXA, it remained moderate. The goal of this paper is to explore if these two limitations could be overcome by using automatic classification tools, independent of any waveguide model.

Using the Sm-Co alloy system as an example, which is a typical representative of the high-temperature permanent magnetic materials, we established an intelligent database and the corresponding information management system, where the data acquisition, data annotation, data extraction and data format conversion are flexibly integrated. We set up correlation models for the elemental composition, phase constitution, crystal structure, processing, measurement, and properties of the materials. From these models, the collected data are structured and the logical associations of related data are explicit. Thus, high-quality datasets can be produced from the developed system according to certain requirements for materials design. In the developed information management system, the online data annotation by multi-user has been realized. Moreover, the system is advanced in high-efficiency data entry and unifying data format, and precise search for redundant data. It has been confirmed that the present specific database and information management system play an important role in the data-driven materials design, and are promising in the applications in the fields of materials genome initiative and materials informatics.",materials database; information management system; materials genome initiative; data-driven materials design,Article,,,,,,,,

For order dispatching, an approach is proposed that uses multi-agent reinforcement learning, where AMR agents learn to bid on orders based on their individual observations.

Predicting heart disease is a complex task since it requires experience along with advanced knowledge. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has lately been adopted in healthcare systems to collect sensor values for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. Many researchers have focused on the diagnosis of heart disease, yet the accuracy of the diagnosis results is low. To address this issue, an IoT framework is proposed to evaluate heart disease more accurately using a Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN). The smartwatch and heart monitor device that is attached to the patient monitors the blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). The MDCNN is utilized for classifying the received sensor data into normal and abnormal. The performance of the system is analyzed by comparing the proposed MDCNN with existing deep learning neural networks and logistic regression. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDCNN based heart disease prediction system performs better than other methods. The proposed method shows that for the maximum number of records, the MDCNN achieves an accuracy of 98.2 which is better than existing classifiers.","Heart,Diseases,Biomedical monitoring,Cloud computing,Monitoring,Electrocardiography,AEHO,cuttlefish algorithm,MDCNN,IoT,Cleveland dataset,sensors,wearable device,CAGR,electrocardiogram,LSTM,and CNN",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"HEALTH-CARE,INTERNET,THINGS,CLOUD,ARCHITECTURE,DIAGNOSIS,SYSTEM",IEEE ACCESS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05999,

This makes the contradiction between timely and effective detection and test results cannot be given quickly by traditional technology become particularly outstanding. In this paper, a new method based on Bayesian-convolutional neural network model transfer learning is proposed to detect water-binder ratio, the most important parameter in mix proportion of concrete mixtures. Bayesian optimization was applied to pretrained convolutional neural networks to establish Bayesian-convolutional neural network models, avoiding tuning hyperparameters manually. The authors performed several experiments and obtained large numbers of images of freshly-mixed concrete mixtures, which were used as datasets to carry out water-binder ratio detection. These models achieved high accuracies on training, validation and testing sets. Applying these models, we could implement real-time and high sampling rate water-binder ratio detection. The authors integrated the models and developed a detection system of concrete mix proportion. Equipped with definite hardware facilities, this system can effectively monitor the quality of concrete in production process and prevent engineering accidents. According to training curves of the models, a new parameter was introduced to discuss how mix proportion influence the sensitivity of concrete mixtures apparent state to the change of water-binder ratio, which is an important consideration to preliminary assess the service behaviors of concrete.

We demonstrate the application of one such simple automated machine learning algorithm to a dataset obtained about COVID-19 spread in South Korea to better understand the disease dynamics.
Material and methods: Data from 20th January 2020 (when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea) to 4th March 2020 was accessed from Korea's centre for disease control (KCDC). A future time-series of specified length (taken as 7 days in our study) starting from 5th March 2020 to 11th March 2020 was generated and fed to the model to generate predictions with upper and lower trend bounds of 95% confidence intervals. The model was assessed for its ability to reliably forecast using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric.
Results: As on 4th March 2020, 145,541 patients were tested for COVID-19 (in 45 days) in South Korea of which 5166 patients tested positive. The predicted values approximated well with the actual numbers. The difference between predicted and observed values ranged from 4.08% to 12.77%. On average, our predictions differed from actual values by 7.42% (MAPE) over the same period.

Full matrix capturing (FMC) in combination with the total focusing method (TFM) provides a strong tool for ultrasonic imaging of structures with complex flaw patterns. However, still, operator needs to go through the generated images and manually check for the possible defects. One important task is to separate true and false indications, as some of them are noises or artifacts. Inspecting large structures with TFM Phased Array Imaging generates a huge amount of data which takes a significant time to go through them manually. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of using the neural network as an artificial intelligent toolbox to identify the defects. Using finite element method and an in-house developed TFM code, the phased array images are produced as the input to the neural network. The output of the neural network, target, is defined as the probability of defect existence. After generating TFM final images with different flaw patterns, the network was trained and evaluated based on the stochastic genetic algorithm learning method. This made the training feasible with limited provided data. Results indicate the great potential of machine learning for automatic or assisted defect recognition. The main challenge to pursuing a comprehensive and reliable machine learning toolbox, is to train the system with a satisfactory number of examples in different situations to ensure the final product is able to cover all possible conditions.

A high Pt loading is often required to achieve a practical power density in fuel cells, thus leading to high costs and limited applications. Meanwhile, the high Pt loading promotes aggregation during cycling under harsh electrocatalytic conditions, which reduces the surface area of the catalyst and leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. The formation of alloy or intermetallic nanocrystals via the addition of non-precious metals along with precious metals is one strategy to effectively reduce the cost. Due to the electronic and geometric effects introduced by the non-precious metals, the catalytic performance of these bimetallic nanocrystals can be retained or even improved. Compared to the metallic alloy nanocrystals, the intermetallic ones are more stable in critical catalytic conditions. Due to their highly ordered structures, Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals are widely used as electrode materials for various electrocatalytic reactions in fuel cells, and they show high stability against oxidation and etching. PtCo intermetallic nanocrystals have attained performances that exceed the 2020 target of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Pt activity and stability for the cathode reaction of fuel cells (oxygen reduction reaction). Decreasing the size of intermetallic compounds to the nanometer scale can significantly increase their active site densities due to the large specific surface area. However, the preparation of intermetallic nanocrystals is more complicated than that of alloys. Therefore, to further improve the electrocatalytic properties of intermetallic nanocrystals, an in-depth study of the factors affecting the electrocatalytic properties of nanocrystals is necessary. This review summarizes recent advances in Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals. First, we highlight the controlled synthesis strategies, including direct liquid-phase synthesis, the thermal annealing approach, and chemical vapor deposition. Of these strategies, direct liquid-phase synthesis is the most common approach to prepare the intermetallic nanocrystals. Second, the diverse potential applications of different electrocatalytic reactions are summarized. The reactions include the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), as well as the oxidation reactions of formic acid (FAOR), methanol (MOR), and ethanol (EtOR). Of these reactions, ORR is the most important, and it has been widely studied. Some advanced characterization techniques and machine learning research based on density functional theory (DFT) are also mentioned.

An algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial networks was developed and trained on microscopy datasets from breast-cancer and bone-osteosarcoma cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and U2OS, respectively. Several established performance metrics-the mean absolute error (MAE), peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural-similarity-index (SSIM)-as well as a novel performance metric, the tolerance level, were measured and compared for the same algorithm and input data.RESULTS: For the MDA-MB-231 cells, F-actin signal performed the fluorescent antibody staining of vinculin prediction better than phase-contrast as an input. For the U2OS cells, satisfactory metrics of performance were archieved in comparison with ground truth.

Current methods such as OCT and intravascular ultrasonography are very expensive and do not provide conclusive information about the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, especially within the human thoracic aorta. This paper presents a new solution to the identification of atherosclerotic lesions based on a specially constructed endoscope that uses CCD cameras. The endoscope analyses the condition of the walls of the blood vessels (side analysis) and represents a step towards an in vivo investigation of part of the human body. The remaining problem is the exact identification of the places where changes occur in the human tubular vessels. Research using the fluorescence phenomenon gives a summary result from an area whose location can be determined with an accuracy of millimetres. For pipes with sufficiently large internal diameter CCD cameras can be used to produce images of the examined tissues. It is possible for doctors to use the images so obtained to identify diseased areas with high accuracy.
An alternative approach for identifying atherosclerosis is to use a neural network method to analyse the received pictures. Popular methods such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning can also be used to identify features in medical images. Creating a 'learning' database of endoscopic images in which a doctor identifies regions of healthy and atherosclerotic tissue is time consuming.

A common method to measure optical aberrations uses sensors to locally capture the gradients across a grid of points. This data is used to reconstruct the wavefront resulting from light passing through the eye. In using this method of measurement, typical individual variations such as scarring or eyelashes can lead to shortcomings in the data. These shortcomings can manifest as noise or even areas of entirely missing data. The use of ANN (artificial neural networks) is one way to minimize the effects of these unpredictable deviations.
In this work, ANN's were used to determine higher order Zernike coefficients based on coordinates and gradients of the wavefront at those locations. To accomplish this, different ANN architectures were evaluated using sets of ideal inputs to establish the best performing baseline model. This baseline model was then compared with models that were trained under varying conditions created by incorporating deviations from ideal samples. By training neural networks using variable quality data, models can be created to reconstruct wavefronts and account for these conditions.

One conventional method to improve SNR by reducing noise is to average a large number of sequentially acquired images. However, this results in increased data acquisition time and reduced throughput. Longer exposures are also problematic for light-sensitive samples. We developed an alternative method, using a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture that significantly reduces the number of images required to obtain exceptionally high SNR. Our model takes 5 noisy grayscale images as an input to generates a denoised image as an output. The model is trained on synthetically generated examples with added noise and fine tuned on real data. We demonstrate fast and robust denoising for images of fluorescent samples. Our method is capable of enhancing features while minimizing sample degradation from prolonged light exposure.","denoising,deep learning,CNN,low SNR,fluorescence microscopy",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Physics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

Diverse videos ( in terms of shape, size, structure, and camera angle) of both materials are captured and labeled as either AlSi10Mg (24357 frames) or IN718 ( 9222 frames). A given frame can contain single or multiple parts of a material. The segmentation approach is applied to extract each part and 121,036 images are obtained.

The ISMI-2017 publicly available dataset is used for evaluating the model in this implementation. The Lab color space shows an F1- score of 0.9365, which is the highest segmentation performance when compared to the other color spaces.

X-Ray computed tomography (CT) can produce high-quality images of the parts in a non-destructive manner. The images, however, are grayscale valued, often have artifacts and noise, and require expert interpretation to spot flaws. In order for anomaly detection to be reproducible and cost effective, an automated method is needed to find potential defects. Traditional supervised machine learning techniques fail in the high reliability parts regime due to large class imbalance: there are often many more examples of well-built parts than there are defective parts. This, coupled with the time expense of obtaining labeled data, motivates research into unsupervised techniques. In particular, we build upon the AnoGAN and f-AnoGAN work by T. Schlegl et al. and created a new architecture called PandaNet. PandaNet learns an encoding function to a latent space of defect-free components and a decoding function to reconstruct the original image. We restrict the training data to defect-free components so that the encode-decode operation cannot learn to reproduce defects well. The difference between the reconstruction and the original image highlights anomalies that can be used for defect detection. In our work with CT images, PandaNet successfully identifies cracks, voids, and high z inclusions. Beyond CT, we demonstrate PandaNet working successfully with little to no modifications on a variety of common 2-D defect datasets both in color and grayscale.","Deep learning,machine learning,anomaly detection,outlier detection,quality assurance",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Physics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1811813,

The main hurdle for widespread deployment of AI-based decision making in healthcare is a lack of interpretability of the cutting-edge deep learning-based methods. Conventionally, decision making by deep learning methods is considered to be a black box. Recently, there is a focus on developing techniques for explaining the decisions taken by deep neural networks, i.e. Explainable AI (XAI) to improve their acceptability for medical applications. In this study, a framework for interpreting the decision making of a deep learning network for retinal OCT image classification is proposed. An Inception-v3 based model was trained to detect choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular edema (DME) and drusen from a dataset of over 80,000 OCT images. We visualized and compared various interpretability methods for the three disease classes. The attributions from various approaches are compared and discussed with respect to clinical significance.

Then we input the original images to crop them, which can effectively prevent the noise introduced in the processes of image processing and changing the pixels in the original image.

Our method was introduced the random translation in image cropping and horizontal flipped to augment the OCT images. Then we applied two methods to build two data sets used to train the network, and we divided each of the data sets into a training set and a validation set. Next, we designed an efficient classification network and trained it with the two training sets respectively, to acquire the two models that can classify OCT images.

If the diagnosis and treatment are conducted too late, it may result in various degrees of vision loss, even blindness. Therefore, individuals with diabetes should have a regular annual eye exam. Studies showed that early detection can prevent vision loss in earlier stages. However, in places such as undeveloped or developing countries, and even sometimes rural areas in developed countries, may not have enough resources for DR screening. Furthermore, even though these places may have adequate equipment, the diagnosis may take a few days to obtain results for the analysis of the ophthalmologists. Developing an automated detection algorithm is an emerging research area to diagnose DR remotely using a retina image. Localizing the optic disc and fovea is an essential task in these DR detection algorithms. After locating the optic disc, finding other components of the retina is easier.
Technological developments in recent years enable the acceleration of diagnosis of such diseases including DR. Deep learning techniques are becoming an essential part of the medical field. In the last years, there have been many attempts to automatize the analysis of medical disorders such as breast cancer, glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy. In this paper, we presented the utilization of a pre-trained deep learning framework to localize the optic disc in the retina images. Using the transfer learning approach for AlexNet with a linear regression output, we localized the optic disc center. Retina images with labeled ground truth values of optic disc center were used to retrain the AlexNet. We tested our proposed deep learning-based optic disc localization approach with three different publicly available datasets including EyePACS, Messidor, and IDRID. Based on the results, the deep learning-based optic disc localization method shows high detection accuracy.

Segmentation is a key image analysis step, after which attributes of the wound segment (e.g. wound area and tissue composition) can be analyzed. The Associated Hierarchical Random Field (AHRF) formulates the image segmentation problem as a graph optimization problem. Handcrafted features are extracted, which are then classified using machine learning classifiers. More recently deep learning approaches have emerged and demonstrated superior performance for a wide range of image analysis tasks. FCN, U-Net and DeepLabV3 are Convolutional Neural Networks used for semantic segmentation. While in separate experiments each of these methods have shown promising results, no prior work has comprehensively and systematically compared the approaches on the same largewound image dataset, or more generally compared deep learning vs non-deep learning wound image segmentation approaches. In this paper, we compare the segmentation performance of AHRF and CNN approaches (FCN, U-Net, DeepLabV3) using various metrics including segmentation accuracy (dice score), inference time, amount of training data required and performance on diverse wound sizes and tissue types. Improvements possible using various image pre- and post-processing techniques are also explored. As access to adequate medical images/data is a common constraint, we explore the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of the wound dataset. We found that for small datasets (<300 images), AHRF is more accurate than U-Net but not as accurate as FCN and DeepLabV3. AHRF is also over 1000x slower.

To ensure this property, the optical and process simulations must be invariant to the geometrical transformations of the translation, rotation, and reflection. Simulators must support invariance both in theory, mathematically, and in practice, numerically. The invariance of compact modeling operators has never been scrutinized before.
Aim: We aim to examine manner and conditions under which optical simulations preserve or violate intrinsic invariances of exact imaging. We analyze invariances of Volterra operators, which are widely used in compact process modeling. Our goal is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions under which such operators become fully invariant
Approach: We use theoretical analysis to deduce full invariance conditions and numerical simulations to illustrate the results.
Results: The linear fully invariant operators are convolutions with rotationally symmetrical kernels. The fully invariant quadratic operators have special functional form with two radial and one polar argument and are not necessarily rotationally symmetrical. We deduced invariance conditions for the kernels of high-order Volterra operators.

Determination of damage types and severity often involves extensive signal processing techniques that often require high sampling rate, which is challenging due to the hardware limitations. It also includes the associated numerical error, which leads to a high false alarm rate or low detection capabilities. We propose a model-assisted machine learning algorithm to identify damage types and severity based on mode converted wave strength. Machine learning techniques are employed to develop classification models assisted by the finite element simulation models. Finite element simulation models provide the training data for various cases of damage and severity involving common types of damages in composites like delamination, transverse crack and material degradation.

In a larger study we tested the model on grey-matter images of 927 left and 927 right-handed patients from the UK Biobank. Here all right-handed images and all left-handed images were classified as belonging to one class. The results suggest that there is no structural difference in grey-matter between the two hemispheres that can be distinguished by the deep learning classifier.","CNN,MRI,handedness,asymmetry,anatomical structure",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"RESTING-STATE,CONNECTIVITY,MOTOR,CORTEX,ASYMMETRY",,,

Compressive strength is one of the most critical parameters when designing concrete structures, and it is widely used by engineers. This parameter is usually determined through expensive laboratory tests, causing a loss of resources, materials, and time. However, artificial intelligence and its numerous applications are examples of new technologies that have been used successfully in scientific applications. Artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models are generally used to resolve engineering problems. In this work, three models are designed, implemented, and tested to determine the compressive strength of concrete: random forest, SVM, and ANNs. Pre-processing data, statistical methods, and data visualization techniques are also employed to gain a better understanding of the database. Finally, the results obtained show high efficiency and are compared with other works, which also captured the compressive strength of the concrete.","Compressive strength of concrete,Artificial neural network,Support vector machine,Random forest",Article,"SCIPEDIA S L, SCIPEDIA S L, BARCELONA, 00000, SPAIN","Engineering,Mathematics",,0.442,,REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE METODOS NUMERICOS PARA CALCULO Y DISENO EN INGENIERIA,https://doi.org/10.23967/j.rimni.2020.09.008,

99,Detection of Data Matrix Encoded Landmarks in Unstructured Environments using Deep Learning,,,74-80,"Almeida Tiago,Santos Vitor,Lourenco Bernardo,Fonseca Pedro","Almeida T,Santos V,Lourenco B,Fonseca P",Almeida T,,Universidade de Aveiro,"Visual based navigation in industrial environments has been a challenge because of the complex and unstructured nature of the surroundings that Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and autonomous robots have to traverse in a continuous routine in many production facilities. Since natural landmarks are still a huge challenge due to the highly dynamic configuration of the environment and the varying nature of these landmarks, simple and low cost artificial landmarks appear as a potential solution. The one exploited in this work uses simple sheets of paper with Data Matrix encoded markers spread in the environment trying to create a constellation of landmarks in such a way that several of them are always visible to a set of cameras on board the robot or AGV. All codes are unique, which makes robot continuous localization a much simpler challenge whenever at least two or three landmarks are visible. When using traditional vision techniques in large images of the scene, one of the most demanding parts is to detect the landmarks to further process them. For that purpose, this paper proposes a technique based on deep learning that efficiently detects these special landmarks in images. A dedicated dataset was created and a Faster R-CNN architecture was adapted and trained for that purpose. The results show that almost all markers was detected in the images with a processing speed larger more than one order of magnitude than traditional techniques, including in demanding situations of poorer illumination or partial occlusions.","deep learning,object detection,Data Matrix,AGV,self-localization,unstructured environments",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Robotics",,,,,,
100,An efficient generalised opposition-based multi-objective optimisation method for factory cranes with time-space constraints,14,5,684-714,"Zhou Binghai,Liao Xiumei","Zhou BH,Liao XM",Zhou BH,,Tongji University,"In order to improve the performance of large manufacturing enterprises, besides the adoption of new technologies, it is also feasible to efficiently schedule logistics equipment such as cranes, which costs much less since only software changes are involved. In this research, the objectives of minimising total waiting cost and total delay cost are optimised simultaneously when executing crane-delivery tasks in factories. Given the time-space constraints and NP-hard nature of the problem, a generalised opposition-based learning (GOBL) mechanism and two problem-based searching strategies are developed and fused into the multi-objective differential evolution approach, namely GOMODE. The introduction of GOBL mechanism enables the proposed algorithm to search in a more extensive solution space, which improves the population diversity and avoids the premature problem. The performance of the GOMODE has been compared with classical multi-objective optimisation algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the GOMODE achieves a better performance both on solutions' quality and diversity.
