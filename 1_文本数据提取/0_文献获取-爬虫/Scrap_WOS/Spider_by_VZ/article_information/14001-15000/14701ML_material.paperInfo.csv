Although it is well documented that both waste properties (e.g., elemental composition) and carbonization process conditions influence hydrochar properties, their specific influence on the total energy that can be recovered using HTC remains unclear. Non-linear random forest models were developed based on data collected from HTC-related literature to describe hydrochar yield and energy content, both of which are required to determine the total energy recovered in the hydrochar. Results indicate that total recoverable energy from organic wastes using HTC is correlated with feedstock carbon content; overall, the total energy content for feedstocks with carbon contents ranging from approximately 40 - 48% are similar. In addition, the total energy that can be recovered from the feedstock remains fairly constant when the initial solids concentrations are greater than 20%. Reaction time appears to have little influence on total recoverable energy from each feedstock at reaction times greater than approximately 150min, while increases in reaction temperature result in a slight decline in total recoverable energy because of decreases in hydrochar yields at higher temperatures.

At present, these defects can be inserted in digital twins that aim to replicate in a mechanical model what is observed on a component so that an image-based diagnosis can be further conducted. However, the variety of defects, the complexity of their shape, and the computational complexity of finite element models related to their digital twin make this kind of diagnosis too slow for any practical application. We show that a classification of observed defects enables the definition of a dictionary of digital twins. These digital twins prove to be representative of model-reduction purposes while preserving an acceptable accuracy for stress prediction. Nonsupervised machine learning is used for both the classification issue and the construction of reduced digital twins. The dictionary items are medoids found by a k-medoids clustering algorithm. Medoids are assumed to be well distributed in the training dataset according to a metric or a dissimilarity measurement. In this paper, we propose a new dissimilarity measurement between defects. It is theoretically founded according to approximation errors in hyper-reduced predictions. In doing so, defect classes are defined according to their mechanical effect and not directly according to their morphology. in practice, each defect in the training dataset is encoded as a point on a Grassmann manifold. This methodology is evaluated through a test set of observed defects totally different from the training dataset of defects used to compute the dictionary of digital twins. The most appropriate item in the dictionary for model reduction is selected according to an error indicator related to the hyper-reduced prediction of stresses. No plasticity effect is considered here (merely isotropic elastic materials), which is a strong assumption but which is not critical for the purpose of this work. in spite of the large variety of defects, we provide accurate predictions of stresses for most of defects in the test set.","Data encoding,Hyper-reduction,Reduced order model,ROM-net,Taxonomy of defects,Computer vision",Article,"centre Mersenne pour ldition scientifique ouverte, Cellule Mathdoc Batiment Ceta, 150 Rue de la Chimie CS 40700, Grenolde Cedex 9, FRANCE",Mechanics,,1.902,"HYPER-REDUCTION,INTERPOLATION,METHOD,FINITE-ELEMENT,POROSITY,STRATEGY,MODELS,DAMAGE,STEEL,PDES",COMPTES RENDUS MECANIQUE,https://comptes-rendus.academie-sciences.fr/mecanique/item/10.5802/crmeca.51.pdf,

Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss.

A statistical model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to compare a previously developed aneurysm rupture logistic regression probability model (LRM) to other machine learning (ML) classifiers for discrimination of aneurysm rupture status. Methods Hemodynamic, morphological, and patient-related information of 1631 cerebral aneurysms characterized by computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to train support vector machines (SVMs) with linear and RBF kernel (RBF-SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifiers for predicting the aneurysm rupture status. The classifiers' accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated and compared to the LRM using 249 test cases obtained from two external cohorts. Additionally, important variables were determined based on the random forest and weights of the linear SVM. Results The AUCs of the MLP, LRM, linear SVM, RBF-SVM, kNN, decision tree, and random forest were 0.83, 0.82, 0.80, 0.81, 0.76, 0.70, and 0.79, respectively. The accuracy ranged between 0.76 (decision tree,) and 0.79 (linear SVM, RBF-SVM, and MLP). Important variables for predicting the aneurysm rupture status included aneurysm location, the mean surface curvature, and maximum flow velocity. Conclusion The performance of the LRM was overall comparable to that of the other ML classifiers, confirming its potential for aneurysm rupture assessment. To further improve the predictions, additional information, e.g., related to the aneurysm wall, might be needed.","Cerebral aneurysm,Risk factors,Hemodynamics,Shape,Prediction,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"UNRUPTURED,INTRACRANIAL,ANEURYSMS,RISK-FACTORS,PREDICTION,PREVALENCE",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Several supervised learning-based approaches have been proposed for optic disc detection. However, these approaches demand that the input training examples are completely labelled. Essentially, in medical image analysis, it is difficult to prepare several training samples which were given reliable class labels due to the fact that manually labelling data is very expensive. Moreover, retinal images such as complex vessels structures in the optic disc constituting nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional observation space, which cannot work well by traditional linear classifiers. In this study, a novel approach named low-rank representation based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (LRR-SSELM) is proposed for automated optic disc detection.

In addition,we have chosen 7 health assessment indicators of the control position,with the raw material data preprocessed through the method of the score standardization. For,such a division of the control position health status may help to reach a in-depth grasp of the operational situation of the air traffic and provide a prediction of the potential risks of the ATC units effectively.

To illustrate the rationality of its clinical application, it is important to study its generation mechanism, with the aid of ASSR source localization results. As the source activities of ASSR have the sinusoidal form, it would be simpler and more robust to consider the source localization problem based on the Fourier component of EEG recordings. However, there is currently no source localization algorithm specially designed for ASSR. In this paper, based on the empirical Bayesian framework, the ASSR source localization problem was modeled on the Fourier component instead of the recorded data itself. In consideration of the joint sparsity among various data segments, a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm was developed, realized by the idea of expectation maximization (EM). The localization accuracy of proposed SBL algorithm is verified by simulation experiments using synthesized ASSR data.

According to the raw data of the main influencing factors related to the explosion speed of explosives, the factor analysis method was used to process the dimensional data of the factors affecting the explosive speed of 20 explosives, and three common factors were obtained. The explosion rate of the original 13 explosives was replaced by three common factors. Influencing factors are used as the input layer parameters of BP neural network. The explosive explosion velocity prediction model combined with factor analysis and BP neural network method is established to predict the explosion velocity of explosives. The improved BP neural network prediction method is verified by the example data. The final verification result is that the relative average error between the predicted and actual values of the 15 training samples is 1.05%, which proves that the improved BP neural network model with training has a good fitting effect. The relative errors of the five predicted samples were 1.44%, 2.14%, 3.49%, 0.78%, and 1.95%, respectively, which were less than 10%, which proved that the improved BP neural network prediction model has better prediction accuracy.","Explosive explosion rate,factor analysis method,BP neural network,simulation prediction",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering",,,,"PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE 4TH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, NETWORKING, ELECTRONIC AND AUTOMATION CONTROL CONFERENCE (ITNEC 2020)",,

Supervised machine learning methods have been successful in lesion detection. However, these methods usually rely on a large number of manually delineated images for specific imaging protocols and parameters and often do not generalize well to other imaging parameters and demographics. Most recently, unsupervised models such as autoencoders have become attractive for lesion detection since they do not need access to manually delineated lesions. Despite the success of unsupervised models, using pre-trained models on an unseen dataset is still a challenge. This difficulty is because the new dataset may use different imaging parameters, demographics, and different pre-processing techniques. Additionally, using a clinical dataset that has anomalies and outliers can make unsupervised learning challenging since the outliers can unduly affect the performance of the learned models. These two difficulties make unsupervised lesion detection a particularly challenging task. The method proposed in this work addresses these issues using a two-prong strategy: (1) we use a robust variational autoencoder model that is based on robust statistics, specifically the beta-divergence that can be trained with data that has outliers; (2) we use a transfer-learning method for learning models across datasets with different characteristics. Our results on MRI datasets demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of lesion detection by adapting robust statistical models and transfer learning for a variational autoencoder model.","variational autoencoders,lesion detection,robust variational autoencoders,brain imaging,anomaly detection",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,SEGMENTATION,,,

These discrepancies have an economic cost for the company (e.g. waste disposal), as well as an environmental impact (food waste and increased carbon footprint). This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management.
A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used...) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies.
This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls. As a consequence, accurate predictive models can potentially improve the profitability of food companies, also reducing their environmental impact.","Output uncertainty,Waste management,Empirical study,Production planning,Sustainability",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Operations Research & Management Science,,,"BIG,DATA,SUPPLY,CHAIN,MANAGEMENT,MODELS,SYSTEM,ANALYTICS,SAFETY",OPERATIONS RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/522228,

These properties have led to a rapidly increasing range of commercial applications; this, however, may come at a cost, if an association to long-term health and environmental risks is discovered or even just perceived. Many nanomaterials (NMs) have not yet had their potential adverse biological effects fully assessed, due to costs and time constraints associated with the experimental assessment, frequently involving animals. Here, the available NM libraries are analyzed for their suitability for integration with novel nanoinformatics approaches and for the development of NM specific Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) for human and environmental risk assessment, all within the NanoSolveIT cloud-platform. These established and well-characterized NM libraries (e.g. NanoMILE, NanoSolutions, NANoREG, NanoFASE, caLIBRAte, NanoTEST and the Nanomaterial Registry (>2000 NMs)) contain physicochemical characterization data as well as data for several relevant biological endpoints, assessed in part using harmonized Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) methods and test guidelines. Integration of such extensive NM information sources with the latest nanoinformatics methods will allow NanoSolveIT to model the relationships between NM structure (morphology), properties and their adverse effects and to predict the effects of other NMs for which less data is available. The project specifically addresses the needs of regulatory agencies and industry to effectively and rapidly evaluate the exposure, NM hazard and risk from nanomaterials and nano-enabled products, enabling implementation of computational 'safe-by-design' approaches to facilitate NM commercialization.

However, conventional approaches for tumor biopsy purity evaluation require experienced pathologists and/or various materials/experiments therefore were time-consuming and error prone. Rapid, easy-toperform and cost-effective methods are thus still of demand. Recent studies had demonstrated that molecular signatures were informative to this task. Previously, we had developed GeneCT, a deep learning-based cancerous status and tissue-of-origin classifier for pan-tumor/tissue biopsies. In the current work, we applied GeneCT on datasets collected from various groups, where the experimental protocols and cancer types differed from each other. We found that GeneCT showed high accuracies on most datasets; for samples with unexpected results, in-depth investigations suggested that they might suffer from imperfect purity. In silico mixture experiments further showed that GeneCT classification was highly indicative in predicting the purity of the tumor biopsies. Considering that transcriptome profiling is a common and inexpensive experiment in molecular cancer studies, our deep learning-based GeneCT could thus serve as a valuable tool for rapid, preliminary tumor biopsy purity assessment.

Purpose: To develop machine learning methods to predict COPD using chest radiographs and a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with near-concurrent pulmonary function test (PFT) data. Comparison is made to natural language processing (NLP) of the associated radiologist text reports.
Materials and Methods: This IRB-approved single-institution retrospective study uses 6749 two-view chest radiograph exams (2012-2017, 4436 unique subjects, 54% female, 46% male), same-day associated radiologist text reports, and PFT exams acquired within 180 days. The Image Model (Resnet18 pre-trained with ImageNet CNN) is trained using frontal and lateral radiographs and PFTs with 10% of the subjects for validation and 19% for testing. The NLP Model is trained using radiologist text reports and PFTs. The primary metric of model comparison is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The Image Model achieves an AUC of 0.814 for prediction of obstructive lung disease (FEV1/FVC <0.7) from chest radiographs and performs better than the NLP Model (AUC 0.704, p<0.001) from radiologist text reports where FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second and FVC = forced vital capacity. The Image Model performs better for prediction of severe or very severe COPD (FEV1 <0.5) with an AUC of 0.837 versus the NLP model AUC of 0.770 (p<0.001).
Conclusion: A CNN Image Model trained on physiologic lung function data (PFTs) can be applied to chest radiographs for quantitative prediction of obstructive lung disease with good accuracy.","machine learning,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,quantitative image analysis,natural language processing",Article,"DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD, PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",Respiratory System,,3.739,SEGMENTATION,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801924,

It operates in an end-to-end manner and provides detection and classification of nodules simultaneously together with a segmentation of the detected nodules. Both the nodule detection and classification subnetworks of the proposed joint network adopt a 3-D encoder-decoder architecture for better exploration of the 3-D data. Moreover, the classification subnetwork utilizes the features extracted from the detection subnetwork and multiscale nodule-specific features for boosting the classification performance. The former serves as valuable prior information for optimizing the more complicated 3D classification network directly to better distinguish suspicious nodules from other tissues compared with direct backpropagation from the decoder. Experimental results show that this co-training yields better performance on both tasks. The framework is validated on the LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets and a pseudo-label approach is proposed for addressing the label uncertainty problem due to inconsistent annotations/labels. Experimental results show that the proposed nodule detector outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and yields comparable performance as state-of-the-art nodule classification algorithms when classification alone is considered.

Hence, pathologists and radiologists need a computer-aided diagnosis system to assist their clinical diagnoses effectively and efficiently. However, most breast cancer recognition models are faced with the sample scarcity problem, which results in serious overfitting and lowers recognition performance. To alleviate the sample scarcity problem, a simple, effective model called ""refinement, correlation, adaptive"" (RCA) for breast cancer recognition is proposed from the perspective of fine-grained feature selection. An innovative multiview efficient range-based gene selection algorithm is proposed to complete the first-layer feature ""refinement,"" which contributes to suppressing the noisy information in the original feature space. Then, more-discriminant but low-dimensional information among heterogeneous features is mined through the second-layer cross-modal ""correlation"" mining. Feature dimensions are reduced to a reasonable value that fits the sample size well and alleviates the overfitting problem. Finally, the last-layer decision-tree-guided ""adaptive"" feature selection is completed using the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. The RCA model was validated on two well-known datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCA model can address the sample scarcity problem well. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially in terms of accuracy and the area of the Kiviat diagram. The largest performance improvements of the metrics are 2.39% and 1121, respectively.

However, the characteristic chest x-ray (CXR) findings necessary for a clinical diagnosis of ACS can be difficult to detect, as is determining which patient needs a CXR. This makes early detection difficult; but it is critical in order to limit ACS severity and subsequent fatalities. This research project looks to apply percussion and auscultation techniques that can provide an immediate diagnosis of acute pulmonary conditions by using an automated standard percussive input and electronic auscultation for computational analysis of the measured signal. Measurements on sickle cell patients having ACS, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), and regular clinic visits (healthy) were recorded and analyzed. Average intensity of sound transmission through the chest and lungs was determined in the ACS and healthy subject groups, revealing an average of 1014 dB decrease in sound intensity in the ACS group compared to the healthy group. A random under-sampling boosted tree classification model identified with 94 accuracy the positive ACS and healthy observations. The analysis also revealed unique measurable changes in a small number of cases clinically classified as complicated VOC, which later developed into ACS.

Six different machine learning regression models were employed. The observed CuMCs were reinforced with two different volume fractions (2 vol.% and 7vol.%) of ZrB2 particles. Based on experimental work, we extracted the independent variables (features) like the milling time (MT, Hours), dislocation density (DD,m(-2)), average particle size (PS, mu m), density (rho,g/cm(3)) and yield stress (sigma, MPa) while the Vickers hardness (MPa) was used as the dependent variable.

The concept of energy security combines several aspects at the same time, as it can be considered in terms of the availability of own energy resources, it concerns technical aspects related to technical infrastructure, as well as political aspects related to the management and diversification of energy supplies. Another aspect of the issue of energy security is the environmental perspective, which is now becoming a priority in the light of the adopted objectives of the European Union's energy policy. The restrictive requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the required level of renewable energy sources in the energy balance of the Member States is becoming a challenge for economies that use fossil fuels to a large extent in the raw material structure, including Poland. Poland is the largest producer of hard coal in the European Union and hard coal is a strategic raw material as it satisfies about 50% of the country's energy demand. In this context, the main goal of the article was to determine the future sale of hard coal by 2030 in relation to environmental regulations introduced in the energy sector. For this purpose, a mathematical model with a 95% confidence interval was developed using artificial LSTM neural networks, which belong to deep learning machine learning techniques, which reflects the key relationships between hard coal mining and the assumptions adopted in the National Energy and Climate Plan for the years 2021-2030 (NECP).","time series,principal components analysis,hard coal sales,LSTM artificial neural networks",Article,"POLSKA AKAD NAUK, POLISH ACAD SCIENCES, MINER & ENERGY ECON RES INST PAS, PL DEFILAD 1, WARSZAWA, 00-901, POLAND","Mineralogy,Mining & Mineral Processing",,0.96,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION,GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,,

However, the non-invasive estimation of respiratory volume in non-intubated patients remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach to respiratory volume monitoring (RVM) that continuously predicts TV and MV in normal subjects. Respiratory flow in 19 volunteers under spontaneous breathing was recorded using respiratory inductance plethysmography and a temperature-based wearable sensor. Temperature signals were processed to identify features such as temperature amplitude and mean value, among others. The feature datasets were then used to train and validate three machine-learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction of respiratory volume based on temperature-related features. A model based on Random-Forest regression resulted in the lowest root mean-square error and was subsequently chosen to predict ventilatory parameters on subject test data not used in the construction of the model. Our predictions achieve a bias (mean error) in TV and MV of 16.04 mL and 0.19 L/min, respectively, which compare well with performance metrics reported in commercially-available RVM systems based on electrical impedance. Our results show that the combination of novel respiratory temperature sensors and machine-learning algorithms can deliver accurate and continuous estimates of TV and MV in healthy subjects.","Monitoring,TV,Training,Temperature sensors,Ventilation,Predictive models,Machine learning,Hypoventilation,machine learning,respiratory monitoring,ventilatory parameters",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,,IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09296762.pdf,

A significant fraction of breakdowns in electronic devices result from capacitor failures. Multilayer ceramic capacitors, the most common capacitor type, are especially prone to mechanical damage, for instance, during the assembly of a printed circuit board. Such damage may dramatically shorten the life span of the component, eventually resulting in failure of the entire electronic device. Unfortunately, current electrical production line testing methods are often unable to reveal these types of damage. While recent studies have shown that acoustic measurements can provide information about the structural condition of a capacitor, reliable detection of damage from acoustic signals remains difficult. Although supervised machine learning classifiers have been proposed as a solution, they require a large training data set containing manually inspected damaged and intact capacitor samples. In this work, acoustic identification of damaged capacitors is demonstrated without a manually labeled data set. Accurate and robust classification is achieved by using a one-class support vector machine, a machine learning model trained solely on intact capacitors. Furthermore, a new algorithm for optimizing the classification performance of the model is presented. By the proposed approach, acoustic testing can be generalized to various capacitor sizes, making it a potential tool for production line testing.","Capacitors,Acoustic measurements,Ceramics,Data models,Support vector machines,Machine learning,Acoustic emission,Ceramic capacitors,acoustic emission,nondestructive testing,support vector machines",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"FLEX,CRACKING,LOCALIZATION,DEFECTS",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09298760.pdf,

This approach can be used to detect internal defects (pores) in metallic Additively Manufactured (AM) materials. Such defects occur in high-strength alloys produced with direct laser sintering AM method for nuclear energy applications. Pulsed thermal imaging system utilizes a high intensity flash lamp to rapidly heat surface of sample, a high sensitivity infrared camera to capture data of surface temperature variations. The data cube obtained with PT (stack of surface temperature images at different times) can be analyzed with image processing algorithms to detect material defects. Compared with conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods, such as digital radiography and ultrasonic testing, the PT pulsed infrared thermal detection technique has advantages of one-sided non-contact measurements, fast processing of large sample areas captured in one image. Detection of small material defects requires finding features in thermal images, which have signal contrast levels approaching sensitivity limit of IR camera. In this study, an optimized Neural Learning based Blind Source Separation (NLBSS) algorithm, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is demonstrated to automatically extract principal temporal and spatial features of thermography frames to enhance flaw detection. By using the NLBSS algorithm, material internal defects can be automatically detected. Furthermore, this processing approach compensates for experimental thermal imaging artifacts, such as noise and uneven heating.

However, as the resolution of measurement at these frequencies captures the underlying microstructure of the tissue, we will investigate the validity limits of such effective material models over a wide frequency range (10 MHz - 200 GHz). Embedded in a parameterizable virtual workbench, we implemented a numerical homogenization method using a hierarchical multiscale approach to capture both the dispersive and tensorial electromagnetic properties of the tissue, and determined at which frequency this homogenized model deviated from a full-wave electromagnetic reference model within the framework of a Monte-Carlo analysis. Simulations were carried out using a generic hypodermal tissue that emulated the morphology of the microstructure. Results showed that the validity limit occurred at surprisingly low frequencies and thus contradicted the traditional usage of homogenized tissue models. The reasons for this are explained in detail and thus it is shown how both the lower ""allowed"" and upper ""forbidden"" frequency ranges can be used for frequency-selective classification/identification of specific material and structural properties employing a supervised machine-learning approach.

However, detecting emotions using the fusion of multiple physiological signals remains a complex and challenging task. When fusing physiological signals, it is essential to consider the ability of different fusion approaches to capture the emotional information contained within and across modalities. Moreover, since physiological signals consist of time-series data, it becomes imperative to consider their temporal structures in the fusion process. In this study, we propose a temporal multimodal fusion approach with a deep learning model to capture the non-linear emotional correlation within and across electroencephalography (EEG) and blood volume pulse (BVP) signals and to improve the performance of emotion classification. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using two different fusion approaches - early fusion and late fusion. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) long short-term memory (LSTM) model to fuse the EEG and BVP signals to jointly learn and explore the highly correlated representation of emotions across modalities, after learning each modality with a single deep network. The performance of the temporal multimodal deep learning model is validated on our dataset collected from smart wearable sensors and is also compared with results of recent studies. The experimental results show that the temporal multimodal deep learning models, based on early and late fusion approaches, successfully classified human emotions into one of four quadrants of dimensional emotions with an accuracy of 71.61% and 70.17%, respectively.","Feature extraction,Brain modeling,Electroencephalography,Physiology,Emotion recognition,Deep learning,Sensors,Emotion recognition,electroencephalography,blood volume pulse,convolutional neural network,long short-term memory,temporal multimodal fusion",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"BODY,EEG",IEEE ACCESS,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3027026,

Motor power, as the most basic parameter providing the energy source for the oil well, is directly related to the real-time operation state of oil well. Therefore, a novel deep and broad learning system (DBLS) based on motor power data for fault diagnosis of sucker rod pump is proposed in this paper. Considering the key parameters such as mechanical wear and balance weight, the motor power data are labeled by the DCs with typical working conditions. Furthermore, CNN-based feature extractor is designed to make up for the lack of expert experience in motor power, which is obtained by merging the output of the CNNs with the manual features extracted based on mechanical analysis. And then the broad learning system is employed as the classifier to solve the problem of real-time update of system structure.

Its performance has been tested on both synthetic and real-world periodic time series data (PTSD) with very encouraging results. In particular, We have observed that the PCA is capable of achieving 100% accuracy in the case of low noise PTSD. Even the training of the PCA is not economical if the data do not contain much noise, it still demonstrates high performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Turner syndrome, also known as congenital ovarian hypoplasia syndrome, is a common clinical chromosomal disorder. Without the aid of cytogenetic diagnostic results, the accuracy of diagnosis made by the paediatrician is unsatisfactory. Early diagnosis of the Turner syndrome requires the expertise of well-trained medical professionals, which may hinder early intervention due to a high potential cost. So far, most of the studies have reported the use of clinical chromosome detection to diagnose Turner syndrome. In this research, we are the first to use facial recognition technology to diagnose Turner syndrome using ensemble learning techniques. First, the features from each of the facial image are extracted by principal component analysis, kernel-based principal component analysis, and others. Second, we randomly selected samples and features to establish a basic learning model. Finally, we developed a combination of multiple basic learning models using majority voting and stacking for the facial image classification task.

They are good candidates for medical image classification especially when the labeled training data are limited. In medical image classification, one of the major challenges is the highly class imbalanced problem which causes deep learning networks to bias towards the majority class and poorly recognizes the minority class. Despite that there are some methods for addressing this problem, very few algorithm-level methods exist for SNNs. In this work, we propose an imbalanced reward-modulation spike-timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) learning rule for SNNs to solve the medical image class imbalanced problem. We introduce an imbalanced reward coefficient for the R-STDP learning rule to set the reward from the minority class to be higher than that of the majority class, and this reward coefficient can help to set the class-dependent rewards according to the data statistic of the training dataset. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets with imbalanced splits show that our method significantly improves the performance than that of the baseline SNNs and outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods addressing medical image class imbalanced problem including data-level and algorithm-level methods. Moreover, our method achieves excellent classification performance on the imbalanced medical dataset ISIC-2018. The results show that the proposed method can well help SNNs in classifying imbalanced medical image datasets.

To date, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are the only effective VF treatment. Acute myocardial infarction is the most common cause of VF, and cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, electrolyte imbalance, cardiotoxic medication, and even ion channel abnormality can cause VF. Physicians have attempted to identify specific patterns in electrocardiography (ECG) that might predict VF in the short term. For example, ST segment changes might imply coronary artery occlusion with myocardial ischemia, increasing VF risk. However, in most cases, VF occurs abruptly without any early warning. Machine learning is used to extract information usually neglected by the human brain. In deep learning, a cascade of multiple layers of processing is used to extract features. Machine learning is used to classify different types and outcomes of cardiac arrhythmias that are difficult to recognize directly.

Specifically, after decomposing the covariance matrix for the features into a lower triangular matrix, an artificial dataset can be generated by multiplying the lower triangular matrix by random variables. This method is computationally fast, and the augmentation is stable. When the brainwave data were augmented using this method, classification performance was improved by 1.08%-6.72%. This method focuses on mean, correlation, and not taking into account the other statistical parameters. Since it rapidly generates a large dataset, it can also be useful in other applications.","Covariance matrices,Training,Classification algorithms,Correlation,Gallium nitride,Tongue,Task analysis,Artificial data,brain&#8211,machine interface,classification accuracy,covariance matrix,data augmentation",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"CHOLESKY,DECOMPOSITION,GENERATION,DIAGNOSIS,NETWORKS",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09268942.pdf,

Twenty-nine patients with relapsing-remitting MS and a history of ON were recruited together with 63 age- and sex-matched controls (HC). There were 33 eyes with a history of ON (MSON), 25 non-ON fellow eyes (MSFE) and 63 HC eyes. Ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography was used to image the macula of each participant, and the volumetric dataset was segmented to yield a topographic thickness map of the GCIPL. The thickness map was analyzed using discrete wavelet transform to extract useful features, which were further analyzed with three machine learning methods, including logistic regression (LR), logistic regression regularized with the elastic net penalty (LR-EN), and support vector machine (SVM), for classification between groups. LR-EN with nested leave-one-out cross-validation resulted in 94% (83%) sensitivity and 100% (97%) specificity in discriminating MSON (MSFE) eyes from HC eyes in the training data and 88% (64%) sensitivity and 94% (94%) specificity in discriminating MSON (MSFE) eyes from HC eyes in the validation data, which were similar to or better than those resulting from LR and SVM. LR-EN improved the sensitivity and specificity of discriminating prior ON and MSFE eyes in patients with MS from HC eyes compared with traditional thickness analysis. It may be promising in facilitating the diagnosis of subclinical ON in patients with MS.","Support vector machines,Machine learning,Feature extraction,Optical imaging,Discrete wavelet transforms,Wavelet analysis,History,Machine learning,retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer,multiple sclerosis,discrete wavelet transform,thickness map,logistic regression,elastic net,support vector machine",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"AGE-RELATED,ALTERATIONS,GLAUCOMA,DETECTION,DIAGNOSIS,CLASSIFICATION,REDUCTION,ATROPHY",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09273013.pdf,

Materials and Methods: Conventional and spectral CT images (iodine maps, virtual monochromatic images (VMI)) were obtained from a spectral dual-layer CT system. Patient diagnosis were known from the clinical reports and classified into healthy, cyst and hypodense metastasis. In order to compare the value of spectral versus conventional datasets when being passed as input to machine learning algorithms, we implemented a weakly-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns liver lesion localisation without pixel-level ground truth annotations. Regions-of-interest are selected automatically based on the localisation results and are used to train a second CNN for liver lesion classification (healthy, cyst, hypodense metastasis). The accuracy of lesion localisation was evaluated using the Euclidian distances between the ground truth centres of mass and the predicted centres of mass. Lesion classification was evaluated by precision, recall, accuracy and F1-Score. Results: Lesion localisation showed the best results for spectral information with distances of 8.22 10.72 mm, 8.78 15.21 mm and 8.29 12.97 mm for iodine maps, 40 keV and 70 keV VMIs, respectively. With conventional data distances of 10.58 17.65 mm were measured. For lesion classification, the 40 keV VMIs achieved the highest overall accuracy of 0.899 compared to 0.854 for conventional data. Conclusion: An enhanced localisation and classification is reported for spectral CT data, which demonstrates that combining machine-learning technology with spectral CT information may in the future improve the clinical workflow as well as the diagnostic accuracy.","CNN,liver lesion,computed tomography,dual-energy CT,AI,hepatic imaging,spectral CT",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"DUAL-ENERGY,CT,PRINCIPLES",BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,https://doi.org/10.1088/2057-1976/ab6e18,

Polysomnography is commonly used for apnea screening which is an expensive, time-consuming, and complex process. In this paper, a simple but efficient technique based on the variational mode decomposition (VMD) for automated detection of sleep apnea from single-lead ECG is proposed. The heart rate variability and ECG-derived respiration signals obtained from ECG are decomposed into different modes using the VMD, and these modes are used for extracting different features including spectral entropies, interquartile range, and energy. The principal component analysis is employed to reduce the dimension of the feature vector. The experiments are conducted using the Apnea-ECG dataset, and the classification performance of various classifiers is investigated. In per-segment classification, an accuracy of about 87.5% (Sens: 84.9%, Spec: 88.2%) is achieved using the K-nearest neighbor classifier. In per-recording classification, the proposed technique using the linear discriminant analysis model outperformed the existing apnea detection approaches by achieving the accuracy of 100%. The algorithm also provided the best agreement between the estimated and reference apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values. These results show that the algorithm has the potential to be used for home-based apnea screening systems.","ECG,hermite decomposition,sleep apnea,entropy,SVM",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,RESPIRATORY,MOVEMENT,ENTROPY,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHMS,FEATURES,SIGNALS,ELECTROCARDIOGRAM",BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,,

Briefly, the environment is subdivided into a clutter, where objects are freely located, and a set of clusters, where objects should be placed according to predefined ordering and classification rules. A 3D grid discretizes such environment: the properties of an object within a cell depict its state. Such attributes include object category and order. A Markov Decision Process formulates the problem: at each time step, the state of the cells fully defines the environment's one. Users can custom-define object classes, ordering priorities, and failure rules. The latter by assigning a non-uniform risk probability to each cell. Performed experiments successfully trained and validated a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to solve several sorting tasks while minimizing the number of moves and failure probability.

The design of the workstations was found to impair the performance, physical and mental health of employees. However, the mechanism underlying cognitive activity involved during workstation design-related stress effects in the PFC has not been fully understood. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to simultaneously measure electrical activity and hemoglobin concentration changes in the PFC. The multimodal signal was collected from 23 healthy adult volunteers who completed the Montreal imaging stress task in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations. A supervised machine learning method based on temporally embedded canonical correlation analysis (tCCA) was utilized to obtain the association between neural activity and local changes in hemoglobin concentrations to enhance localization and accuracy. The results showed deactivation in alpha power rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as declined activation pattern of the fused data in the right PFC at the non-ergonomic workstation. Additionally, all participants at the non-ergonomic workstation experienced a substantial rise in salivary alpha-amylase activity in comparison with the ergonomic workstation, indicating the existence of high-stress levels. The proposed tCCA approach obtains excellent results in discriminating workstation types achieving accuracies of 98.8% and a significant improvement of 8.0% (p < 0.0001) and 9.4% (p < 0.0001) over EEG-only and fNIRS-only, respectively.

In this study, deep learning-based classification methods were investigated comprehensively to differentiate two subtypes of NSCLC, namely adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). The study used 1457 F-18-FDG PET images/slices with tumor from 94 patients (88 men), 38 of which were ADC and the rest were SqCC. Three experiments were carried out to examine the contribution of peritumoral areas in PET images on subtype classification of tumors. We assessed multilayer perceptron (MLP) and three convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as SqueezeNet, VGG16 and VGG19 using three kinds of images in these experiments: 1) Whole slices without cropping or segmentation, 2) cropped image portions (square subimages) that include the tumor and 3) segmented image portions corresponding to tumors using random walk method. Several optimizers and regularization methods were used to optimize each model for the diagnostic classification. The classification models were trained and evaluated by performing stratified 10-fold cross validation, and F-score and area-under-curve (AUC) metrics were used to quantify the performance. According to our results, it is possible to say that inclusion of peritumoral regions/tissues both contributes to the success of models and makes segmentation effort unnecessary.

Automated image analysis methods attempt to reduce the workload from the clinicians and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular choice for this purpose. However, size of a WSI image typically is approximately 40,000 x 40:000 pixels (can reach up to 100,000 x 100:000 pixels). CNNs cannot handle such large images. Moreover, downscaling a WSI image causes degradation of small-scale visual information. Hence, a large number of small patches (containing critical visual information) from a WSI image are extracted by a trained pathologist and are used for training. However, it requires massive amounts of time to precisely search and label appropriate class-representative patches. To address this issue, a Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) based CNN framework has been introduced in this paper. In the proposed framework every slide is represented as a bag of extracted patches. Only the bag label is used for training, thus eliminating the requirement to provide patchwise labels. The patches inherit the label of the bag containing them. A WSI image (i.e. a bag) is labeled benign if all its patches are benign and labeled malignant even if a single patch contains malignant cells. Learning can be carried out at the bag level even with noisy patch labels.

On this basis, a detailed data analysis is made according to the focus area of the model. To solve the poor convergence of the Policy Gradient (PG) algorithm used in traditional RAM, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Recurrent Attention Model (DDPG-RAM) model and a priority experience replay algorithm based on Gaussian sampling are proposed. The internal information such as Time Difference (TD) error and reward value of training samples is fully utilized. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves the classification accuracy, convergence and stability. Finally, according to the attention block and attention center from the output results of the model, the subcortical tissue of autism group and control group were analyzed. Attention block mainly concentrated in the right thalamus and right caudate nucleus, while the attention center mainly focused on the right white matter and right cerebral cortex. There were significant differences in volume and voxel values of the above regions between the autistic group and the control group.

This study aims to explore the output from a variety of CNN models implemented in the MRI or/and PET classification tasks for AD prediction while trying to summarize its characteristics with a variety of parameters that are tuned and changed. There are many architectures available; however, we are testing a basic architecture with a change in the reception area based on the convolutional layer's kernel size and its strides. The architecture has been categorized as converging, diverging, or equivalent if the filter kernel size is unchanged. This investigation studies a simple encoder based CNN with a sequential flow of features from low-level to high-level feature extraction. The idea is to present a diverging reception area by increasing the filter size and stride from a lower to a higher level. As a result, the feature redundancy is reduced and the trivial features keep on diminishing. The proposed architecture is referred to as 'divNet', and several experiments were performed to determine how effective the architecture is in terms of the consumed memory, the number of parameters, running time, classification error, and the generalization error. This study surveys several related experiments by changing the hyper-parameters setting, the architecture selection based on the depth and area of the reception feature, and the data size.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Three-dimensional displays,Feature extraction,Computer architecture,Neurons,Two dimensional displays,Brain,3D CNN,CNN architecture,Alzheimer&#8217,s disease,reception area,feature redundancy,data size,MRI classification",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09269972.pdf,

Based on TS facial images, we propose a new TS diagnosis model, which preserves the original ratio of face width to face height, extracts reliable features and conducts feature analysis based on support vectors (SVs) and principal components (PCs). The proposed TS model is composed of Image Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Classifier Construction and Knowledge Discovery. For Image Preprocessing, by utilizing the techniques of face alignment, facial area intercept and brightness normalization, the original facial images are processed to the desired gray aligned facial area images, while the original ratio of face width to face height remains unchanged. For Feature Extraction, by employing the energy features of facial organ blocks and ratio features roughly and more finely, five reliable feature sets are extracted, i.e., Rough Energy Features, Finer Energy Features (FEF), Rough Ratio Features, Finer Ratio Features (FRF) and FRF2. For Classifier Construction, support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA (KPCA) and ensemble learning methods are used to establish 15 single classifiers (i.e., 5 SVM classifiers, 5 PCA+SVM classifiers and 5 KPCA+SVM classifiers) and 2 ensemble classifiers. The classifier established by the weighted voting method achieves the highest accuracy of 0.9127; FEF outperforms the other four feature sets. For Knowledge Discovery, the feature analysis based on SVs and PCs is carried out to discover important features. It is found that less energy of external canthus areas and a lower ratio of forehead height to forehead width often occur in TS patients through analyzing SVs, and the energy and ratio features of left zygoma area are important in identifying TS by analyzing PCs.","Knowledge discovery,machine learning,principal components analysis,support vector machine,turner syndrome",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,,IEEE ACCESS,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3038231,

Chest CT imaging has been widely used in clinical practice for disease diagnosis, but image reading is still a time-consuming work. We aim to integrate an image preprocessing technology for anomaly detection with supervised deep learning for chest CT imaging-based COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, a matrix profile technique was introduced to CT image anomaly detection in two levels. At one-dimensional level, CT images were simply fiatted and transformed to a one-dimensional vector so that the matrix profile algorithm could be implemented for them directly. At two-dimensional level,a matrix profile was calculated in a sliding window way for every segment in the image. An anomaly severity score (CT-SS) was calculated, and the difference of the CT-SS between the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images was tested. A sparse anomaly mask was calculated and applied to penalize the pixel values of each image. The anomaly weighted images were then used to train standard DenseNet deep learning models to distinguish the COVID-19 CT from Non-COVID-19 CT images. A VGG19 model was used as a baseline model for comparison. Although extra finetuning needs to be done manually, the one-dimensional matrix profile method could identify the anomalies successfully. Using the two-dimensional matrix profiling method, CT-SS and anomaly weighted image can be successfully generated for each image. The CT-SS significantly differed among the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images (p value < 0:05). Furthermore, we identified a potential causal association between the number of underlying diseases of a COVID-19 patient and the severity of the disease through statistical mediation analysis. Compared to the raw images, the anomaly weighted images showed generally better performance in training the DenseNet models with different architectures for diagnosingCOVID-19, whichwas validated using two publicly availableCOVID-19 lung CT image datasets. The metric Area Under the Curve(AUC) on one dataset were 0.7799(weighted)vs. 0.7391(unweighted), 0.7812(weighted) vs. 0.7410(unweighted), 0.7780(weighted) vs. 0.7399(unweighted), 0.7045(weighted) vs. 0.6910(unweighted) for DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and the baseline model VGG19, respectively.

With necessary preprocessing, the fNIRS signals are statistically analyzed to localize the most significant activated regions regarding the applied stimuli. The experiment shows that movement-related events have a strong correlation with the prefrontal hemodynamics.

The aftereffects of the cycle emulated attack may eventually create a micro-crack in the heat-exchanger. This event eventually causes the contamination of HFE due to multiple chemical interactions. This study proposes a new classification methodology to detect HFE chemical impurities using induction by a 532nm laser. The purpose of the laser induction is to leverage its laser speckle contrast attributes and amplify its detection. One of the reasons for choosing the 532nm laser spectrum is its highest quantum efficiency. Once amplification of detection is achieved, the detector tends to be in a highly sensitive mode due to low marginality to differentiate between two different conditions. This mode is prone to be stochastic. Thus, a new form of architecture known as Deep Learning Laser Speckle Contrast Evolving Spiking Neural Network (DL-LSC-ESNN) is proposed. The architecture utilizes speckle contrast domain conversion, dimensional additivity of the receptive neuron of evolving spiking neural network (ESNN), followed by the strength of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction (FE) capability. Ultimately, the evolving and adaptive ability of ESNN is assimilated and integrated seamlessly. CNN acted to extract only an important spike train, and the result is its essences of important spikes or spike feature maps. The spike feature maps are then fed into the ESNN neuron repository, which either assimilates or creates a new neuron repository. The proposed methods show significant improvement in the accuracy of detection against multiple baseline state of the art CNN architecture and ultimately demonstrated its capability to detect real-time contamination of HFE thus improved the detection rate significantly for the HVM environment.","Speckle,Chemicals,Chemical lasers,Lasers,Impurities,Liquids,Deep learning,Hydrofluoroether,laser speckle contrast,high volume manufacturing,industrial chiller,ESNN,CNN,deep learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"KINETIC-THEORY,LOCALIZATION,MICROSCOPY,COSINE,SIMILARITY,EXTRACTION,COHERENCE,NEURONS",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09272326.pdf,

Prognosis may vary among patients depending on their seizure semiology, age of onset, seizure onset location, and features of electroencephalogram (EEG). Several researchers have focused on EEG patterns and demonstrated that EEG patterns of individuals with epilepsy can be used to predict prognosis and treatment responses. However, accurate EEG analysis requires an experienced epileptologist with several years of training, who are often unavailable in small or medium sized hospitals. In this paper, a novel machine learning (ML) model that accurately distinguishes Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) from Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is proposed. BECTS and TLE show different seizure types and age of onset, but differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the similar location and patterns of the EEG spikes. The proposed hybrid machine learning (HML) model processes the diagnosis in the order of (1) creating feature matrices using statistical indexes after signal decomposition, (2) processing feature selection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology, and (3) classifying the results through ensemble learning based on decision trees. Simulation was performed using real patient data of 112 BECTS and 112 TLE EEG signals, where training was performed using 80% of the data and 20% of the data was used in the performance analysis comparison with the actual labeled data based on the diagnosis of medical doctors. The performance of the hybrid classification model is compared with other representative ML algorithms, which include logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and ensemble learning based decision tree. The model proposed in this paper shows an accuracy performance exceeding 99%, which is higher than the performance obtainable from the other ML classification models. The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel EEG diagnostic system that shows maximum efficiency to support clinical real-time diagnosis that can accurately distinguish epilepsy types.

Unfortunately, the dominance of AI/ML applications may hinder fundamental understanding of driving parameters in complicated material properties, including the impact of local chemistry and energy influences on nucleation, phase evolution, and bonding. As mathematical complexities are modeled using AI/ML approaches the interaction of driving mechanisms and underlying physics-based and first-principles understanding is often omitted in the final modeling of material behavior. However, microscopy and advanced characterization techniques may help clarify the underlying physics by providing critical validation for mathematical assumptions used in AI/ML models and determining model inter-parameter relationships. Sensing-based characterization is critical for operations using deep learning and/or clustered neural networks where complex interactions between microstructural features strongly impact each other, and driving mechanisms that control material response. The paper addresses several considerations for applying machine learning techniques to fundamental material problems, and the role for parameter validation through characterization. The future of AI/ML materials awareness includes procedural potential applications, advanced analytical tools, and coordinated research discovery thrusts.","Artificial Intelligence,Multimodal Deep Learning,Deep Neural Networks,Context-enhanced information fusion,non-destructive evaluation,manufacturing,materials discovery",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Remote Sensing,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"TENSILE,PROPERTIES,IMAGE,FUSION,ORIENTATIONS,DEFECTS,MODEL",,,

The Electromyography (EMG) signals are generated by human muscle systems when there are any movements and muscular activities. These signals are detected over different areas from the skin surfaces and each movement corresponds to a specific activation pattern of several muscles. In this research, multi-channel EMG measurements were performed with electrodes placed on involved arm muscles. Since deltoid, bicep brachii, pectoris major, and flexor digitorium muscles can almost independently move human arm with adjustable contraction forces, the surface EMG signals from these muscles were utilized to recognize different arm movements. The EMG signals were digitally recorded and processed using digital filters, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms. For feature extraction, the envelopes were extracted from the signal waveforms. To reflect the moving average activities, the root means squares (RMS) operation and normalization were successively utilized as initial signal processing method. Afterward, an activation vector containing normalized RMS signals was obtained in real-time. For machine learning, the activation vectors were utilized to train a real-time support vector machine (SVM) classifier to recognize different muscle EMG signals and their respective motion commands. A detailed analysis using SVM reveals more than 98% accuracy for recognition and successful classification of different motion commands after training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through several experiments.","Electromyography (EMG) signals,digital signal processing (DSP),RMS filter,machine learning,support vector machine (SVM),classification",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Remote Sensing,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"PROSTHESIS,USE,LIMB,LOSS",,,
