Methods:This was a single-center retrospective study of Chinese patients, diagnosed with mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm at baseline, between November 2009 and October 2016. Automated ECG measurements from raw data were determined. The primary outcome was incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Results:A total 59 mitral stenosis patients were included (age 59 [54-65] years, 13 (22%) males). New onset AF was observed in 27 patients. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.08 [1.01-1.16],P= 0.017), systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.03 [1.00-1.07];P= 0.046), meanP-wave area in V3 (odds ratio: 3.97 [1.32-11.96],P= 0.014) were significant predictors of incident AF. On multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.08 [1.00-1.16],P= 0.037) andP-wave area in V3 (OR: 3.64 [1.10-12.00],P= 0.034) remained significant predictors of AF. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the optimum cut-off forP-wave area in V3 was 1.45 Ashman units (area under the curve: 0.65) for classification of new onset AF. A decision tree learning model with individual and non-linear interaction variables with age achieved the best performance for outcome prediction (accuracy = 0.84, precision = 0.84, recall = 0.83,F-measure = 0.84). Conclusion:Atrial electrophysiological alterations in mitral stenosis can detected on the electrocardiogram. Age, systolic blood pressure, andP-wave area in V3 predicted new onset AF. A decision tree learning model significantly improved outcome prediction.","mitral stenosis,mitral valve,P-wave area,decision tree,machine learning",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"INTERATRIAL,BLOCK,DISPERSION,DURATION,CARDIOVERSION,RECURRENCE",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/41577/1/fbioe_08_00479.pdf,

Current pCLE reconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled Cartesian grid, using a naive linear interpolation. It was shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could improve pCLE image quality. Yet classical CNNs may be suboptimal in regard to irregular data. Methods We compare pCLE reconstruction and super-resolution (SR) methods taking irregularly sampled or reconstructed pCLE images as input. We also propose to embed a Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel regression into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer. We design deep learning architectures allowing for reconstructing high-quality pCLE images directly from the irregularly sampled input data. We created synthetic sparse pCLE images to evaluate our methodology. Results The results were validated through an image quality assessment based on a combination of the following metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index. Our analysis indicates that both dense and sparse CNNs outperform the reconstruction method currently used in the clinic. Conclusion The main contributions of our study are a comparison of sparse and dense approach in pCLE image reconstruction.

While being a topic of investigation for centuries, it has remained mostly qualitative to date. A quantitative analysis of fracture surfaces is of prime interest for both the scientific community and the industrial sector, bearing the potential for improved understanding on the mechanisms controlling the fracture process and at the same time assessing the reliability of computational models currently being used for material design. With new advances in the field of image analysis, and specifically with machine learning tools becoming more accessible and reliable, it is now feasible to automate the process of extracting meaningful information from fracture surface images. Here, we propose a method of identifying and quantifying the relative appearance of intergranular and transgranular fracture events from scanning electron microscope images. The newly proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network algorithm for semantic segmentation. The proposed method is extensively tested and evaluated against two ceramic material systems (Al2O3, MgAl2O4) and shows high prediction accuracy, despite being trained on only one material system (MgAl2O4). While here attention is focused on brittle fracture characteristics, the method can be easily extended to account for other fracture morphologies, such as dimples, fatigue striations, etc.","FAILURE,MICROSTRUCTURE,RECOGNITION",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Mechanics,,4.243,"FAILURE,MICROSTRUCTURE,RECOGNITION",ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS,https://e-archivo.uc3m.es/bitstream/10016/31841/1/tesis_stylianos_tsopanidis_2020.pdf,

Such facilities are rare in Egypt and modern dating techniques which are indispensable in Geoarchaeology to establish a robust chronology are not available, as sample transport is restricted and Egypt does not provide OSL or AMS C-14 laboratories. With these preconditions, we evaluate the usability of pXRF geochemical data for the dating of archaeological sediments with machine learning techniques. The sample material was collected via sampling of archaeological sections and profile walls from archaeological excavations in the northwestern Nile delta at the settlement site Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) and Kom el-Gir. Additionally, samples were taken from sediments and cultural layers uncovered from their surroundings using vibracore corings with open steel auger heads. In this methodological approach, we examine the applicability of pXRF methods and test the sample data for distinct geochemical differences between the main settlement phases with multivariate statistical methods. The dating is based on the training of artificial neural networks with pXRF data from archaeological material of well-dated context to date test data of cultural layers within the vibracores. This allows us to link fundamental changes in the landscape with the settlement history of Buto and neighboring tells.","Geoarchaeology,Geochemistry,Sediment dating",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Physical Geography,Geology,Paleontology",,3.469,"PORTABLE,XRF,MULTI-PROXY,PATTERNS,SEDIMENTS,POTTERY,SITES",PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY,,

To achieve highly efficient steady and dynamic performance of solar chemical reactor with less catalyst, in this study, catalytic activity is adjusted by diluting catalyst with encapsulated phase change material. At first, two-dimensional model of solar parabolic trough receiver reactors diluted with encapsulated phase change material is established and validated. Then, effect of catalytic activity on performance of reactor is discussed. Afterwards, one-dimensional model is derived from two-dimensional model to train Back Propagation neural network for quick and precise performance prediction of reactor. Finally, optimal catalytic distribution is obtained by genetic algorithm and Back Propagation neural network, and steady and unsteady performance of reactor between uniform and optimal catalytic distribution are compared. The results show that when catalytic activity decreases from 1.0 to 0.2, steady methanol conversion efficiency and production rate of H-2 are reduced by 8.4% and 9.9%, and reactor shows more stability under unsteady condition of solar radiation. One-dimensional model derived in present study is accurate enough and time-saving compared to two-dimensional model. And compared to reactor fully packed with catalyst, reactor with optimal catalytic distribution can achieve similar steady performance with 56% less of catalyst, but shows better stability under the fluctuation of solar radiation.","Solar thermochemical reactor,Solar radiation fluctuation,Catalytic activity's distribution,One-dimensional model",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,9.953,"PREDICTIVE,CONTROL,THERMAL,STORAGE,MOLTEN-SALT,RECEIVER,REFORMER,MODEL",APPLIED ENERGY,,

Twenty shear-bond strength models published over the past 20 years have been collected and analyzed. These models take into account the effects of the concrete compressive strength, concrete width, FRP elastic modulus, FRP thickness, FRP width and FRP bond length on the ultimate bond strength of the FRP-concrete interface. This paper evaluates the predictive accuracy of the 20 collected models and finds that these models have limited accuracy. To accurately predict the bond strength of the FRP-concrete interface, this paper employs the back propagation neural networks (BPNN) method to train and WA the database and builds an artificial neural networks (ANN) model that consists of weighted values, biases and transfer functions. The ANN model WA conducts 84 training iterations and selects the optimal combination of input nodes. The accuracy of the developed ANN model is higher (i.e., lower predictive error) than that of the existing bond strength models in the literature. Furthermore, this paper develops an explicit user-friendly formula based on the trained ANN model. The proposed formula estimates and validates the 969 bond strength results, and the predictions using the explicit equation fit the WA data very well with small error. As such, the formula can be easily applied during practical designs instead of the implicit processes in the ANN model.","FRP,BPNN,Shear bond test,Bond strength,Explicit neural networks",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Mechanics,Materials Science",,5.536,"STRESS-SLIP,MODEL,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,BEAMS,PLATES,SHEAR",COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,,

Then, we calculated Mahalanobis distances of the training routine blood data from 355 asthma patients and 1,480 healthy individuals to ensure the efficiency of MS. Orthogonal arrays and signal-to-noise ratios were used to optimize blood biomarker variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the threshold value. Ultimately, we validated the system on 182 individuals based on the threshold value. Out of 35 patients with asthma, MTS correctly classified 94.15% of patients. In addition, 97.20% of 147 healthy individuals were correctly classified. The system isolated 7 routine blood biomarkers.

Therefore, a potentially more efficient approach for estimating BDE is highly desirable. To this end, we combined first-principles calculations and machine learning techniques, including neural networks and random forest, to explore the inner relationships between carbonyl structure and its BDE.

Capsule endoscopy is a new technology which enables a gastroenterologist to visualize the entire digestive tract including small bowel to diagnose bleeding, ulcer and polyp. This paper presents a supervised learning ensemble to detect the bleeding in the images of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy. It accurately finds out the best possible combination of attributes required to classify bleeding symptoms in endoscopy images.

The major disadvantages of magnesium alloys are their weak wear and corrosion resistances. Surface coating is one of the most efficient methods of making material surfaces resistant to wear. Experimental determination of wear loss is expensive and time-consuming. These disadvantages can be eliminated by using machine learning algorithms to predict wear loss. This study used experimentally obtained wear loss data for AZ91D magnesium alloy samples coated via two different spray coating methods (plasma and high velocity oxy-fuel spraying) using various parameters. Support vector regression (SVR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) methods were used to predict wear loss quantities. In models tested using 10-k cross-validation, R-2 was calculated as 0.9601 and 0.9901 when the SVR and ELM methods were applied, respectively. The ELM method was more successful than SVR. Thus, the ELM method has excellent potential to support the production of wear-resistant parts for various applications via spray coating.","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK,DRY SLIDING WEAR,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES,COMPOSITE COATINGS,SURFACE-PROPERTIES,ZIRCONIA COATINGS,HVOF,BEHAVIOR,MICROSTRUCTURE",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,DRY,SLIDING,WEAR,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TRIBOLOGICAL,PROPERTIES,COMPOSITE,COATINGS,SURFACE-PROPERTIES,ZIRCONIA,COATINGS,HVOF,BEHAVIOR,MICROSTRUCTURE",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,,

Therefore, it is highly important to precisely detect urinary particles in the clinical setting. However, artificial microscopy is subjective and time consuming, and various previous detection algorithms lack the adequate accuracy. In this study, a method is proposed for the analysis of urinary particles based on deep learning.
Methods We used seven cellular components (i.e., erythrocytes, leukocytes, epithelial, low-transitional epithelium, casts, crystal, and squamous epithelial cells) in the microscopic imaging of urine as the detection targets. After the extraction of features using Resnet50, feature maps of different sizes are obtained in the last few layers of the feature pyramid net (FPN). The feature maps are then input into the classification subnetwork and regression subnetwork for classification and localization respectively, and detection results are obtained. First, we introduce the basic model (RetinaNet) to detect the cellular components in urinary particles, and the features of the objects can then be extracted more effectively by replacing different basic networks. Lastly, the effects of different weight initialization methods and different anchor scales on the performance of the model are investigated.
Results We obtained the optimal network structure based on the adjustment of the loss functional parameters, thereby achieving the best results in the test set of urinary particles. The experimental data yielded an accuracy of 88.65% with a processing time of only 0.2 s for each image on a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics processing unit (GPU). Our results demonstrate that this method cannot only achieve the speed of the first-stage target detector, but also the accuracy of the two-stage target algorithm in the analysis of urinary particles.
Conclusion This study developed new automated analysis urinary particles based on deep learning, and this method is expected to be used for the automated analysis and detection of urinary particles. Moreover, our approach will be useful for the detection of other cells in the clinical setting.","deep learning,detection,FPN,RetinaNet,urinary particles",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"SEDIMENT,SYSTEMS,URINALYSIS",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

In particular, amorphous materials usually exhibit superior activity and have drawn ever-increasing attention in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the insight into the basic structure-property relation remains far from sufficient owing to their disordered structure and untracked surface state, let alone the effective prediction of adsorption energy. Here, employing the amorphous Ni2P catalyst as an example and powerful machine learning (ML) models, we propose an effective strategy that enables fast and quantitative prediction of the adsorption energy of hydrogen on amorphous Ni2P surfaces. Specifically, our method decomposes the difficult prediction of adsorption energy on amorphous surfaces into two subproblems: frozen adsorption energy and relaxation energy. By training with a set of ab initio adsorption energies within a wide configuration space, we succeed to predict the adsorption energies with similar to 0.1 eV error by adopting the feature only relying on local chemical environment. Our strategy allows us to successfully implement the high-throughput exploration of active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work builds a predictive model of site-specific chemisorption energy, and the related statistical analysis underpins the fundamental understanding of the chemical bond, which could largely facilitate rational design of active amorphous catalysts.","NEURAL-NETWORK POTENTIALS,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,ADSORPTION-ENERGY,SCALING RELATIONS,CO2 REDUCTION,DISCOVERY,PERFORMANCE,OPTIMIZATION,PREDICTIONS,OXIDATION",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"NEURAL-NETWORK,POTENTIALS,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,ADSORPTION-ENERGY,SCALING,RELATIONS,CO2,REDUCTION,DISCOVERY,PERFORMANCE,OPTIMIZATION,PREDICTIONS,OXIDATION",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

In addition, this research assesses the performance of such treatment that characterizes the chemical parameters of generated pollutants. It also aims at optimizing the industrial process for cleaner production. Coagulation-flocculation process is investigated in this study. Moreover, oxidation phase by ozone is taking into account before and after coagulation-flocculation process to measure the effectiveness of the combined method for reducing the main pollutant concentrations. Findings The unhairing and chrome (Cr) tanning steps are considered the most polluting steps. Therefore, the application of various treatment techniques, including chemical and physicochemical processes, is realized to reduce the toxicity of the effluents. The correlation between experimental and modeling results, using artificial neural network (ANN) method, was investigated in this research. The results of the constructed ANN model are measured by the correlation of experimental and model results during coagulation-flocculation and oxidation stages. The validation of the elaborated model through the error calculation (MSE) and the correlation coefficient (R) confirm the reliability of ANN method. Originality/value Eventually, the establishment of ANN model for performance prediction of wastewater parameters is investigated due to different measurements of physical effluent outputs, such as: pH, turbidity, TSS, DS, COD, fat, TSS, S2- and Cr.

We utilize deep learning to mine large data sets of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy images to locate and classify point defects. By combining hundreds of images of nominally identical defects, we generate high signal-to-noise class averages which allow us to measure 2D atomic spacings with up to 0.2 pm precision. Our methods reveal that Se vacancies introduce complex, oscillating strain fields in the WSe2-2xTe2x lattice that correspond to alternating rings of lattice expansion and contraction.

On such dataset, immunohistochemical profiles, based on expression of a restricted panel of gene classifiers, were integrated by machine learning approach to generate a glioblastoma transcriptional signature based on protein quantification that allowed to efficiently assign transcriptional subgroups to an extended cohort. Correlations with both histopathological features and clinical outcome have been also performed.
Glioblastomas (GBM) can be classified into three major transcriptional subgroups (proneural, mesenchymal, classical), underlying different molecular alterations, prognosis, and response to therapy. However, transcriptional analysis is not routinely feasible and assessment of a simplified method for glioblastoma subclassification is required. We propose an integrated molecular and immunohistochemical approach aimed at identifying GBM subtypes in routine paraffin-embedded material. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on representative samples (n = 51) by means of a ""glioblastoma transcriptional subtypes (GliTS) redux"" custom gene signature including a restricted number (n = 90) of upregulated genes validated on the TCGA dataset. With this dataset, immunohistochemical profiles, based on expression of a restricted panel of gene classifiers, were integrated by a machine-learning approach to generate a GliTS based on protein quantification that allowed an efficient GliTS assignment when applied to an extended cohort (n = 197). GliTS redux maintained high levels of correspondence with the original GliTS classification using the TCGA dataset. The machine-learning approach designed an immunohistochemical (IHC)-based classification, whose concordance was 79.5% with the transcriptional- based classification, and reached 90% for the mesenchymal subgroup. Distribution and survival of GliTS were in line with reported data, with the mesenchymal subgroup given the worst prognosis. Notably, the algorithm allowed the identification of cases with comparable probability to be assigned to different GliTS, thus falling within overlapping regions and reflecting an extreme heterogeneous phenotype that mirrors the underlying genetic and biological tumor heterogeneity. Indeed, while mesenchymal and classical subgroups were well segregated, the proneural types frequently showed a mixed proneural/classical phenotype, predicted as proneural by the algorithm, but with comparable probability of being assigned to the classical subtype. These cases, characterized by concomitant high expression of EGFR and proneural biomarkers, showed lower survival. Collectively, these data indicate that a restricted panel of highly sensitive immunohistochemical markers can efficiently predict GliTS with high accuracy and significant association with different clinical outcomes.","INITIATING CELLS,EXPRESSION,RADIATION,EGFR,MET,CLASSIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,BEVACIZUMAB,DISTINCT,GROWTH",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, 75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA","Research & Experimental Medicine,Pathology",,5.391,"INITIATING,CELLS,EXPRESSION,RADIATION,EGFR,MET,CLASSIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,BEVACIZUMAB,DISTINCT,GROWTH",LABORATORY INVESTIGATION,,

Overall CVH scores were classified as poor, intermediate, or ideal for 5 factors, smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, glucose/hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol from clinical data within 5 years prior to the breast cancer diagnosis. The receipt of potentially cardiotoxic breast cancer treatments was indicated if the patient received anthracyclines or hormone therapies. We modeled the outcomes of post-cancer diagnosis CHD and death, respectively. Results Results of these approaches indicated that the joint effect of poor CVH and receipt of cardiotoxic treatments on CHD (75.9%) and death (39.5%) was significantly higher than their independent effects [poor CVH (55.9%) and cardiotoxic treatments (43.6%) for CHD, and poor CVH (29.4%) and cardiotoxic treatments (35.8%) for death].

Recently, there is a move toward ultrasound imaging over plain radiographs (X-rays) for intra-operative navigation due to the radiation-free and cost-effectiveness of the modality. In this process, the intra-operative bone model reconstructed from the segmented ultrasound image is registered with the pre-operative bone model. Deep learning approaches have recently shown remarkable success in bone surface segmentation from ultrasound images. However, to train deep learning models effectively with limited dataset size, data augmentation is essential. This study investigates the applicability of the generative approach for data augmentation as well as identifies standard data augmentation approaches for bone surface segmentation from ultrasound images. Methods The generative approach we used in our work is based on Pix2Pix image-to-image translation network. We have proposed a multiple-snapshot approach, which mitigates the uni-modal deterministic output issue in the Pix2Pix network without using any complex architecture and training process. We also identified standard data augmentation approaches necessary for ultrasound bone surface segmentation through experiments. Results We have evaluated our networks using 800 ultrasound images from trained regions (humerus bone) and 1200 ultrasound images from untrained regions (tibia and femur bones) using four different augmentation approaches. The results show that the generative augmentation approach has a positive impact on accuracy in both trained (+ 4.88%) and untrained regions (+ 25.84%) compared to using only standard augmentations. Moreover, compared to standard augmentation approaches, the addition of the generative augmentation approach also showed a similar trend in both trained (+ 8.74%) and untrained (+ 11.55%) regions. Conclusion Generative approaches are very beneficial for data augmentation, where limited dataset size is prevalent, such as ultrasound bone segmentation. The proposed multiple-snapshot Pix2Pix approach has the potential to generate multimodal images, which enlarges the dataset considerably.","Ultrasound bone segmentation,Deep learning,GAN,Pix2Pix,Augmentation,Osteolytic bone tumor surgery,Cystic bone lesion",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Methods such as ab initio molecular dynamics that work well for superionic conductors can be prohibitively expensive when used on materials that conduct lithium ions less well but are still suitable for use as interfacial coatings. We demonstrate a way to address this problem using machine-learned interatomic potentials models in the form of moment tensor potentials. To prevent the potentials from significantly deviating from density functional theory calculations, we use molecular dynamics simulations coupled with on-the-fly machine learning. This approach increases the efficiency of the calculations by 7 orders of magnitude compared to purely ab initio molecular dynamics, significantly reducing the uncertainty in calculated migration energies and improving agreement with experimentally determined activation energies. Using this approach, we identify two particularly promising materials for use as coatings in batteries as well as several others that are candidates for doping-enhanced ionic conduction.","SOLID-STATE BATTERIES,SECONDARY BATTERIES,INTERFACE STABILITY,PHASE-TRANSITIONS,LI,ELECTROLYTES,LICOO2,LINI0.8CO0.15AL0.05O2,1ST-PRINCIPLES,PERFORMANCE",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Materials Science",,10.837,"SOLID-STATE,BATTERIES,SECONDARY,BATTERIES,INTERFACE,STABILITY,PHASE-TRANSITIONS,LI,ELECTROLYTES,LICOO2,LINI0.8CO0.15AL0.05O2,1ST-PRINCIPLES,PERFORMANCE",CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS,,

The common imaging signs (CISs) which appear in the patient's lung CT scan play a significant role in the identification of cancerous lung nodules and many other lung diseases. In this paper, we propose a new combination of descriptors for the effective retrieval of these imaging signs. First, we construct a feature database by combining local ternary pattern (LTP), local phase quantization (LPQ), and discrete wavelet transform. Next, joint mutual information (JMI)-based feature selection is deployed to reduce the redundancy and to select an optimal feature set for CISs retrieval. To this end, similarity measurement is performed by combining visual and semantic information in equal proportion to construct a balanced graph and the shortest path is computed for learning contextual similarity to obtain final similarity between each query and database image. The proposed system is evaluated on a publicly available database of lung CT imaging signs (LISS), and results are retrieved based on visual feature similarity comparison and graph-based similarity comparison. The proposed system achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 60% and 0.48 AUC of precision-recall (P-R) graph using only visual features similarity comparison.

Materials and methods We assessed TMB in surgical tumor specimens by performing whole exome sequencing. IME profiles, including PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS), stromal CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density, and stromal Foxp3 TIL density, were quantified by digital pathology using a machine learning algorithm. To detect factors associated with TMB, clinical data, and IME factors were assessed by means of a multiple regression model.
Results We analyzed tumors from 200 of the 246 surgically resected NSCLC patients between September 2014 and September 2015. Patient background: median age (range) 70 years (39-87); male 37.5%; smoker 27.5%; pathological stage (p-stage) I/II/III, 63.5/22.5/14.0%; histological type Ad/Sq, 77.0/23.0%; primary tumor location upper/lower, 58.5/41.5%; median PET SUV 7.5 (0.86-29.8); median serum CEA (sCEA) level 3.4 ng/mL (0.5-144.3); median serum CYFRA 21-1 (sCYFRA) level 1.2 ng/mL (1.0-38.0); median TMB 2.19/ Mb (0.12-64.38); median PD-L1 TPS 15.1% (0.09-77.4); median stromal CD8 TIL density 582.1/mm(2) (120.0-4967.6);, and median stromal Foxp3 TIL density 183.7/mm(2) (6.3-544.0).
The multiple regression analysis identified three factors associated with higher TMB: smoking status: smoker, increase PET SUV, and sCEA level: >5 ng/mL (P < .001, P < .001, and P = .006, respectively).
Conclusions The IME factors assessed were not associated with TMB, but our findings showed that, in addition to smoking, PET SUV and sCEA levels may be independent predictors of TMB.

An end-to-end chromosome karyotype analysis system is proposed over medical big data to automatically and accurately perform chromosome related tasks of detection, segmentation, and classification. Facing image data generated and collected by means of edge computing, we firstly utilize visual feature to generate chromosome candidates with Extremal Regions (ER) technology. Due to severe occlusion and cross overlapping, we utilize ring radius transform to cluster pixels with same property to approximate chromosome shapes. To solve the problem of unbalanced and small dataset by covering diverse data patterns, we proposed multidistributed generated advertising network (MD-GAN) to perform data enhancement by generating additional training samples. Afterwards, we fine-tune CNN for chromosome classification task by involving generated and sufficient training images. Through experiments in self-collected datasets, the proposed method achieves high accuracy in tasks of chromosome detection, segmentation, and classification. Moreover, experimental results prove that MD-GAN-based data enhancement contributes to classification results of CNN to a certain extent.","COMPUTATION OFFLOADING METHOD,NEURAL-NETWORK,INCENTIVE MECHANISM,CLASSIFICATION,RECOMMENDATION,SEGMENTATION,OPTIMIZATION",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Mathematics,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,2.8,"COMPUTATION,OFFLOADING,METHOD,NEURAL-NETWORK,INCENTIVE,MECHANISM,CLASSIFICATION,RECOMMENDATION,SEGMENTATION,OPTIMIZATION",COMPLEXITY,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8923838,

This paper provides a novel contribution for classifing ASD using both thermographic and EEG data. The methodology used in this study extracts a variety of feature sets and evaluates the possibility of using several learning models. Mean, standard deviation, and entropy values of the EEG signals and mean temperature values of regions of interest (ROIs) in facial thermographic images were extracted as features. Feature selection is performed to filter less informative features based on correlation. The classification process utilizes Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron algorithms. The integration of EEG and thermographic features have achieved an accuracy of 94% with both logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron classifiers.

We develop (a) a deep-learning method for the detection of unbroken- and broken-spiral waves and (b) the elimination of such waves, e.g., by the application of low-amplitude control currents in the cardiac-tissue context. Our method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that we train to distinguish between patterns with spiral-waves S and without spiral-waves N S. We obtain these patterns by carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations of PDE models for cardiac tissue in which the transmembrane potential V, when portrayed via pseudocolor plots, displays patterns of electrical activation of types S and N S.

Materials and methods We propose to utilize both CBCT and CBCT-based synthetic MRI (sMRI) for the segmentation of soft tissue and bony structures, as they provide complementary information for pelvic organ segmentation. CBCT images have superior bony structure contrast and sMRIs have superior soft tissue contrast. Prior to segmentation, sMRI was generated using a cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN), which was trained using paired CBCT-MR images. To combine the advantages of both CBCT and sMRI, we developed a cross-modality attention pyramid network with late feature fusion. Our method processes CBCT and sMRI inputs separately to extract CBCT-specific and sMRI-specific features prior to combining them in a late-fusion network for final segmentation. The network was trained and tested using 100 patients' datasets, with each dataset including the CBCT and manual physician contours. For comparison, we trained another two networks with different network inputs and architectures. The segmentation results were compared to manual contours for evaluations.
Results For the proposed method, dice similarity coefficients and mean surface distances between the segmentation results and the ground truth were 0.96 +/- 0.03, 0.65 +/- 0.67 mm; 0.91 +/- 0.08, 0.93 +/- 0.96 mm; 0.93 +/- 0.04, 0.72 +/- 0.61 mm; 0.95 +/- 0.05, 1.05 +/- 1.40 mm; and 0.95 +/- 0.05, 1.08 +/- 1.48 mm for bladder, prostate, rectum, left and right femoral heads, respectively. As compared to the other two competing methods, our method has shown superior performance in terms of the segmentation accuracy.
Conclusion We developed a deep learning-based segmentation method to rapidly and accurately segment five pelvic organs simultaneously from daily CBCTs. The proposed method could be used in the clinic to support rapid target and organs-at-risk contouring for prostate adaptive radiation therapy.","adaptive radiotherapy,cone-beam CT,deep learning,multi-organ segmentation,synthetic MRI",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"DEFORMABLE,IMAGE,REGISTRATION,PLANNING,CT,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,CONTOUR,PROPAGATION,DOSE,CALCULATION,CBCT,OPTIMIZATION,FEASIBILITY,THERAPY,IGRT",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429321,

By analyzing the power spectrum of EEG data related to motor imagery, the shared features across sessions or across subjects, namely, the mean and variance of model parameters, are extracted. Then, select the data sets that were most relevant to the new data set according to Euclidean distance to update the shared features. Finally, utilize the shared features and subject/session-specific features jointly to generate a new model. We evaluated our algorithm by analyzing the motor imagery EEG data from 10 healthy participants and a public data set from BCI competition IV. The classification accuracy of the proposed transfer learning is higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms. The results of the paired t test showed that the classification results of PSD and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 2.0946e-9), and the classification results of CSP and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 1.9122e-6). The test accuracy of data set 2a of BCI competition IV was 85.7% +/- 5.4%, which was higher than that of related traditional machine learning algorithms.

Gliomas grading plays an important role to determine the treatment plan and prognosis prediction. In this study we propose two novel methods for automatic, non-invasively distinguishing low-grade (Grades II and III) glioma (LGG) and high-grade (grade IV) glioma (HGG) on conventional MRI images by using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Methods All MRI images have been preprocessed first by rigid image registration and intensity inhomogeneity correction. Both proposed methods consist of two steps: (a) three-dimensional (3D) brain tumor segmentation based on a modification of the popular U-Net model; (b) tumor classification on segmented brain tumor. In the first method, the slice with largest area of tumor is determined and the state-of-the-art mask R-CNN model is employed for tumor grading. To improve the performance of the grading model, a two-dimensional (2D) data augmentation has been implemented to increase both the amount and the diversity of the training images. In the second method, denoted as 3DConvNet, a 3D volumetric CNNs is applied directly on bounding image regions of segmented tumor for classification, which can fully leverage the 3D spatial contextual information of volumetric image data.
Results The proposed schemes were evaluated on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) low grade glioma (LGG) data, and the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) Benchmark 2018 training datasets with fivefold cross validation. All data are divided into training, validation, and test sets. Based on biopsy-proven ground truth, the performance metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are measured on the test sets. The results are 0.935 (sensitivity), 0.972 (specificity), and 0.963 (accuracy) for the 2D Mask R-CNN based method, and 0.947 (sensitivity), 0.968 (specificity), and 0.971 (accuracy) for the 3DConvNet method, respectively. In regard to efficiency, for 3D brain tumor segmentation, the program takes around ten and a half hours for training with 300 epochs on BraTS 2018 dataset and takes only around 50 s for testing of a typical image with a size of 160 x 216 x 176. For 2D Mask R-CNN based tumor grading, the program takes around 4 h for training with around 60 000 iterations, and around 1 s for testing of a 2D slice image with size of 128 x 128. For 3DConvNet based tumor grading, the program takes around 2 h for training with 10 000 iterations, and 0.25 s for testing of a 3D cropped image with size of 64 x 64 x 64, using a DELL PRECISION Tower T7910, with two NVIDIA Titan Xp GPUs.
Conclusions Two effective glioma grading methods on conventional MRI images using deep convolutional neural networks have been developed. Our methods are fully automated without manual specification of region-of-interests and selection of slices for model training, which are common in traditional machine learning based brain tumor grading methods. This methodology may play a crucial role in selecting effective treatment options and survival predictions without the need for surgical biopsy.","brain tumor,convolutional neural networks,deep learning,Glioma grading,MRI image",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"BRAIN,CLASSIFICATION,DIFFUSION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.14168,

However, a systematic approach for the development of individualized, optimal training programs is still lacking, as the learning dynamics of the postural control in PD, over a training program, are poorly understood. Objectives We investigated the learning dynamics of the postural control in PD, during a balance-training program, in terms of the clinical, posturographic, and novel model-based measures. Methods Twenty patients with PD participated in a balance-training program, 3 days a week, for 6 weeks. Clinical tests assessed functional balance and mobility pre-training, mid-training, and post-training. Center-of-pressure (COP) was recorded at four time-points during the training (pre-, week 2, week 4, and post-training). COP was used to calculate the sway measures and to identify the parameters of a patient-specific postural control model, at each time-point. The posturographic and model-based measures constituted the two sets of stability- and flexibility-related measures. Results Mobility- and flexibility-related measures showed a continuous improvement during the balance-training program. In particular, mobility improved at mid-training and continued to improve to the end of the training, whereas flexibility-related measures reached significance only at the end. The progression in the balance- and stability-related measures was characterized by early improvements over the first 3 to 4 weeks of training, and reached a plateau for the rest of the training. Conclusions The progression in balance and postural stability is achieved earlier and susceptible to plateau out, while mobility and flexibility continue to improve during the balance training.","Postural control model,Parkinson's disease,Learning dynamics,Pattern of improvement,Stability and flexibility degree",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,2.905,"PHYSICAL-THERAPY,REHABILITATION,PROGRAM,RESISTANCE,EXERCISE,SPINAL,FLEXIBILITY,TRAINING-PROGRAM,BALANCE,PEOPLE,GAIT,PERFORMANCE,MOTOR",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/194271273/Rahmati2020postural.pdf,

Eight signals from four inertial sensors were mapped onto the two cursor's coordinates on a screen. The mapping matrix was initialized by asking each user to perform free-form spontaneous upper-limb motions and deriving the two main principal components of the motion signals. Participants engaged in a reaching task for 18 min, followed by a tracking task. One group of 10 participants practiced with the same mapping throughout the experiment, while the other 10 with an adaptive mapping that was iteratively updated by recalculating the principal components based on ongoing movements. Results Participants quickly reduced reaching time while also learning to distribute most movement variance over two dimensions. Participants with the fixed mapping distributed movement variance over a subspace that did not match the potent subspace defined by the interface map. In contrast, participant with the adaptive map reduced the difference between the two subspaces, resulting in a smaller amount of arm motions distributed over the null space of the interface map. This, in turn, enhanced movement efficiency without impairing generalization from reaching to tracking. Conclusions Aligning the potent subspace encoded by the interface map to the user's movement subspace guides redundancy resolution towards increasing movement efficiency, with implications for controlling assistive devices. In contrast, in the pursuit of rehabilitative goals, results would suggest that the interface must change to drive the statistics of user's motions away from the established pattern and toward the engagement of movements to be recovered.","Body-machine interface,Motor redundancy,Forward model,Sensorimotor learning",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology,Rehabilitation",,,"SPINAL-CORD-INJURY,ADAPTATION,PLASTICITY,COORDINATION,VARIABILITY,CONVERGENCE,EXPLORATION,MOVEMENTS,DEVICES,DESIGN",JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7216597?pdf=render,

To address this challenge, a patch-based generative adversarial network-based technique is proposed which iteratively learns both thick and thin vessels in fundoscopic images.

With the wealth of data available within the health-care systems, there is a lack of practical analysis tools to discover hidden relationships and trends in data. The complexity of medical data that is unfavorable for most models is a considerable challenge in prediction. The ability of a model to perform accurately and efficiently in disease diagnosis is extremely significant. Thus, the model must be selected to fit the data better, such that the learning from previous data is most efficient, and the diagnosis of the disease is highly accurate. This work is motivated by the limited number of regression analysis tools for multivariate counts in the literature. We propose two regression models for count data based on flexible distributions, namely, the multinomial Beta-Liouville and multinomial scaled Dirichlet, and evaluated the proposed models in the problem of disease diagnosis. The performance is evaluated based on the accuracy of the prediction which depends on the nature and complexity of the dataset. Our results show the efficiency of the two proposed regression models where the prediction performance of both models is competitive to other previously used regression models for count data and to the best results in the literature.","Distribution-based regression,multinomial,Beta-Liouville,scaled Dirichlet,count data,bio-medical data mining,Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Computer Science,,1.572,"DIRICHLET,DISTRIBUTION,MULTIMODEL,INFERENCE",CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS,,

Brain programming is a machine learning methodology successfully tested for the problem of object categorization; however, when working with art images, the objects in pictures of the same category may be different from each other regarding image content. Therefore, it is necessary to find the best set of functions that extract specific features to identify patterns among different techniques.

As a Bayesian model, it incorporates a prior on a set of latent variables. The prior is indexed by some hyperparameters, which have a big impact on inference regarding the model. The ideal estimate of the hyperparameters is the empirical Bayes estimate which is, by definition, the maximizer of the marginal likelihood of the data with all the latent variables integrated out. This estimate cannot be obtained analytically. In practice, the hyperparameters are chosen either in an ad-hoc manner, or through some variants of the EM algorithm for which the theoretical basis is weak. We propose an MCMC-based fully Bayesian method for obtaining the empirical Bayes estimate of the hyperparameter. We compare our method with other existing approaches both on synthetic and real data.

Using bonding characteristics driven structural attributes along with the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity as descriptors, we developed a highly accurate machine learning model to predict the lattice thermal conductivity. Among the descriptors used in this model, bond distance in conjunction with electronic transport properties seamlessly partitions the dataset as a function of variation in the value of lattice thermal conductivity. The empirical formula obtained from non-linear compound descriptors further substantiates the role of bonding attributes in establishing the connection. Additionally, the independent prediction models for the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity involve only elemental and bonding descriptors, thereby negating the need for expensive DFT calculations.

Toward this end, 40000 repeating unit cells (RUCs) comprising an arbitrary number of locally irregular inclusions are generated over a wide range of fiber volume fractions. The finite-volume direct averaging micromechanics is then employed to evaluate the homogenized thermo-mechanical moduli of each RUC. Subsequently, a two-dimensional deep convolution neural network (CNN) is constructed as a surrogate model to extract the statistical correlations between the RUC geometrical information and the corresponding homogenized response. The RUC images together with their homogenized moduli are divided into two datasets in a ratio of 9:1 with the former part used for training the CNN model and the latter part used for verification. The results presented in this contribution demonstrate that the deep CNN predictions exhibit remarkable correlations with the theoretical values generated by the finite-volume micromechanics, with a maximum relative prediction error of less than 8%, providing good support for the data-based homogenization approach.","NANOPOROUS MATERIALS,HOMOGENIZATION,LOCALIZATION,OPTIMIZATION",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"NANOPOROUS,MATERIALS,HOMOGENIZATION,LOCALIZATION,OPTIMIZATION",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03151382/file/LEM3_JAP_2020_CHEN.pdf,

The neural network (NN) was trained using a database of 120 density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the alloy. The DFT database of computed solution energies showed a linear dependence on the composition of the first nearest neighbor metallic shell. This NN was then employed in a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, which took into account two pathways for helium migration, the T-T pathway (T: Tetreahedral) and the T-O-T pathway (a second order saddle in both W and Mo) (O: Octahedral). It was determined that the diffusivity of interstitial helium in W-Mo alloys can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the composition. Moreover, T-O-T pathways were found to dominate the T-T pathways for all alloy compositions for temperatures over about 450K. Heterogeneous structures were also examined to account for radiation-induced segregation. It was observed that diffusion was fast when W segregated to the grain interior region and Mo to the grain outer region and was slow for the reverse situation. This behavior was explained by studying the energy landscape. Finally, thermodynamic simulations indicated that Mo-rich regions of the alloy were most favorable for binding the interstitial helium and may be the sites for the nucleation of helium bubbles.","TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION,ATOM-PROBE TOMOGRAPHY,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TUNGSTEN,IRRADIATION,1ST-PRINCIPLES,RETENTION,DIFFUSION,VACANCY",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,2.389,"TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,GENERALIZED,GRADIENT,APPROXIMATION,ATOM-PROBE,TOMOGRAPHY,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,TUNGSTEN,IRRADIATION,1ST-PRINCIPLES,RETENTION,DIFFUSION,VACANCY",JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,,

The stoichiometric Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof bandgap of GaBP2 is noted to be 1.65 eV, a close ideal value (1.4-1.5 eV) to reach the theoretical Queisser-Shockley limit. The calculated electron mobility is similar to that of silicon. Unlike perovskites, the newly discovered material is thermally, dynamically and mechanically stable. Above all the chemical composition of GaBP2 is non-toxic and relatively earth abundant, making it a new generation of PV material. Using ML, we showed that with a minimal set of features, the bandgap of III-III-V and II-IV-V semiconductor can be predicted up to an RMSE of less than 0.4 eV.

Segmentation of the EAT in a fast and reproducible way is important for the interpretation of its role as an independent risk marker intricate. However, EAT has a variable distribution, and various diseases may affect the volume of the EAT, which can increase the complexity of the already time-consuming manual segmentation work. We propose a 3D deep attention U-Net method to automatically segment the EAT from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Five-fold cross-validation and hold-out experiments were used to evaluate the proposed method through a retrospective investigation of 200 patients. The automatically segmented EAT volume was compared with physician-approved clinical contours. Quantitative metrics used were the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard index (JAC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance (RMSD), and the center of mass distance (CMD). For cross-validation, the median DSC, sensitivity, and specificity were 92.7%, 91.1%, and 95.1%, respectively, with JAC, HD, CMD, MSD, and RMSD are 82.9% +/- 8.8%, 3.77 +/- 1.86 mm, 1.98 +/- 1.50 mm, 0.37 +/- 0.24 mm, and 0.65 +/- 0.37 mm, respectively. For the hold-out test, the accuracy of the proposed method remained high. We developed a novel deep learning-based approach for the automated segmentation of the EAT on CCTA images. We demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed learning-based segmentation method through comparison with ground truth contour of 200 clinical patient cases using 8 quantitative metrics, Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis. Our automatic EAT segmentation results show the potential of the proposed method to be used in computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery diseases (CADs) in clinical settings.","epicardial adipose tissue,segmentation,deep attention U-Net,coronary computed tomography angiography",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"INTIMA-MEDIA,THICKNESS,VISCERAL,ADIPOSITY,CT,ANGIOGRAPHY,THORACIC,FAT,PERFUSION,HEART",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

The data were generated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using a modified and validated version of the PENELOPE (v. 2014) + penEasy (v. 2015) code. A breast model of a homogeneous mixture of adipose and glandular tissue was adopted. The ANNs were constructed using the Keras and scikit-learn libraries for mean glandular dose (MGD) and air kerma (K-air) regressions, respectively. In total, seven parameters were considered, including the incident photon energies (from 8.25 to 48.75 keV), breast geometry, breast glandularity and K-air acquisition geometry. Two ensembles of five ANNs each were formed to calculate MGD and K-air. The normalized glandular dose coefficients (DgN) were calculated using the ratio of the ensemble outputs for MGD and K-air. Polyenergetic DgN values were calculated by weighting monoenergetic values by the spectrum bin probabilities. The results indicate a very good ANN prediction performance when compared to the validation data, with median errors on the order of the average simulation uncertainties (& x224d; 0.2%). Moreover, the predicted DgN values are in good agreement compared with previously published works, with mean (maximum) differences up to 2.2% (9.4%). Therefore, it is shown that ANNs could be a complementary or alternative technique to tables, parametric equations and polynomial fits to estimate DgN values obtained via MC simulations.","mammography,dosimetry,glandular dose,Monte Carlo,machine learning,neural networks",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION,X-RAY-SPECTRA,DGN,COEFFICIENTS,DOSIMETRY",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

Materials with either lower work function or higher work function would find various applications, such as electronic devices and high-performance catalysts. However, it would be challenging to find a material with the optimal work function exploiting the all-search or random approach, whether it is based on an experimental or theoretical method. In this paper, we use the Bayesian optimization (BO) approach, which is one of the most powerful machine-learning tools for optimization, in order to effectively explore a candidate material with a higher or lower work function value out of hundreds of thousands of materials registered in a material database. We introduce a quick measure of the work function based on the depth of the Fermi level calculated from the first-principles computation for the crystalline bulk structure of a material. We call this the approximate work function, treating it as the objective function of our BO scheme. Since we do not need any time-consuming surface calculation with the slab model for the evaluation of the approximate work function, a quick search of a material with the highest or the lowest work function is achieved. As input variables for our BO implementation, we employ some bulk-specific properties of materials, which can be fetched from the database. The demonstration of our BO-based exploration of the database shows that materials with both low and high limits of the approximate work function can be discovered more efficiently in BO than a random exploration. The top 10 lowest work function materials thus found are in line with our chemical intuition in that all of them include either alkali or alkaline earth metal. On the other hand, we found the top 10 highest work function materials with amazement because they also include either alkali or alkaline earth metal and a lanthanide element.","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,SURFACE-ENERGY,METAL-SURFACES,DENSITY,PREDICTION,OXIDES,POTENTIALS,ELECTRONS,ELEMENTS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,SURFACE-ENERGY,METAL-SURFACES,DENSITY,PREDICTION,OXIDES,POTENTIALS,ELECTRONS,ELEMENTS",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

This is a multi-step process involving: (a) collecting data in the form of raw processed or raw images, (b) removing bias by using pre-processing, (c) processing the image and locating the brain tumour, and (d) showing the tumour affected areas on a computer screen or projector. Several systems have been proposed for medical image segmentation but have not been evaluated in the field. This may be due to ongoing issues of image clarity, grey and white matter present in a scan image, lack of knowledge of the end user and constraints arising from MRI imaging systems. This makes it imperative to develop a comprehensive technique for the accurate diagnosis of brain tumors in MRI images. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy consisting of 'Data, Image segmentation processing, and View' (DIV) which are the major components required to develop a high-end system for brain tumour diagnosis based on deep learning neural networks. The DIV taxonomy is evaluated based on system completeness and acceptance. The utility of the DIV taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying 30 state-of-the-art publications in the domain of medFical image segmentation systems based on deep neural networks.

However, the level of degradation in engineering properties of the cement-stabilized soils still needs more scientific attention. In the light of this, a database including a total of 260 unconfined compression and chloride ion penetration tests on cement-stabilized kaolin specimens exposed to sulfate attack was constituted. The data include information about cement type (sulfate resistant-SR; normal portland (N) and pozzolanic-P), and its content (0, 5, 10 and 15%), sulfate type (sodium or magnesium sulfate) as well as its concentration (0.3, 0.5, 1%) and curing period (1, 7, 28 and 90 days). Using this database, linear and nonlinear regression analysis (RA), backpropagation neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference techniques were employed to question whether these methods are capable of predicting unconfined compressive strength and chloride ion penetration of cement-stabilized clay exposed to sulfate attack. The results revealed that these methods have a great potential in modeling the strength and penetrability properties of cement-stabilized clays exposed to sulfate attack.

Then, MTL framework is presented to improve the gesture recognition performance and give information about force levels. Last but not least, to solve the problem that using the greedy principle in MTL, a modified pseudo-task augmentation (PTA) trajectory is introduced. Experiments conducted on two representative datasets demonstrate that compared with other methods, frequency domain information with convolutional neural network (CNN) is more suitable for gesture recognition with variable force levels.

However, this process is time consuming, labour intensive, expensive and destructive to the specimen. Recently, the ability to virtually stain unlabelled tissue sections, entirely avoiding the histochemical staining step, has been demonstrated using tissue-stain-specific deep neural networks. Here, we present a new deep-learning-based framework that generates virtually stained images using label-free tissue images, in which different stains are merged following a micro-structure map defined by the user. This approach uses a single deep neural network that receives two different sources of information as its input: (1) autofluorescence images of the label-free tissue sample and (2) a ""digital staining matrix"", which represents the desired microscopic map of the different stains to be virtually generated in the same tissue section. This digital staining matrix is also used to virtually blend existing stains, digitally synthesizing new histological stains. We trained and blindly tested this virtual-staining network using unlabelled kidney tissue sections to generate micro-structured combinations of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Jones' silver stain, and Masson's trichrome stain. Using a single network, this approach multiplexes the virtual staining of label-free tissue images with multiple types of stains and paves the way for synthesizing new digital histological stains that can be created in the same tissue cross section, which is currently not feasible with standard histochemical staining methods.
Neural networks: Digital stains enhance pathologists' arsenal A machine learning approach uses combinations of multiple digital stains to highlight microscopic elements in a tissue sample, avoiding the delays, inconsistences and sometimes the need for multiple biopsies, all characteristic of traditional manual tissue staining techniques. The deep learning-based tissue staining framework was developed by Aydogan Ozcan, Yair Rivenson and colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles. They used their approach to train neural networks to virtually stain kidney samples with one of three different types of stains or their combinations. Comparisons with manually stained tissue samples demonstrated that the virtual staining was highly accurate. The ability to use multiple digital stains and virtual stain blending on the same tissue sample using a single neural network could allow pathologists to get more relevant information from tissue and thus improve diagnoses.","DEEP,HISTOPATHOLOGY",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Optics,,16.996,"DEEP,HISTOPATHOLOGY",LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-0315-y.pdf,

In this work, we sought automatic solutions to divide medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) images into six main anatomical regions: head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and legs. We implemented and compared three methods: (1) an analytical approach which does not require training and solely relies on utilizing critical points in image intensity profiles to derive cut-planes that divide the scan into the mentioned regions, (2) a classical convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, which classifies each transaxial 2D plane independently and then concatenates classification results, and (3) CNN followed by a context-based correction algorithm (CBCA) which improves the CNN classification using positional relationships between all CT slices. The analytical approach achieved acceptable accuracy for anatomical region segmentation without the need for explicit data labeling and was effective for batch labeling whole-body CTs, greatly reducing manual labeling efforts. CNNs achieved superior accuracy and allowed for rapid development and training, but required labeled data and were susceptible to produce discontinuous anatomical regions and therefore ambiguous anatomical boundaries. Post hoc correction of CNN results using CBCA overcame these limitations, achieving nearly perfect CT slice labeling and anatomical region segmentation.","Image classification,Computed tomography,Pattern recognition,Region detection,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,NETWORKS,NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

While these algorithms have already proven to be useful in uncovering new properties of materials and in simplifying experimental protocols, their usage in liquid crystals research is still limited. This is surprising because optical imaging techniques are often applied in this line of research, and it is precisely with images that machine learning algorithms have achieved major breakthroughs in recent years. Here we use convolutional neural networks to probe several properties of liquid crystals directly from their optical images and without using manual feature engineering. By optimizing simple architectures, we find that convolutional neural networks can predict physical properties of liquid crystals with exceptional accuracy. We show that these deep neural networks identify liquid crystal phases and predict the order parameter of simulated nematic liquid crystals almost perfectly. We also show that convolutional neural networks identify the pitch length of simulated samples of cholesteric liquid crystals and the sample temperature of an experimental liquid crystal with very high precision.","GAME,GO",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"GAME,GO",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7203147?pdf=render,

A rather large pi-bond is a requisite for the pi-pi stacking, and the pi-pi stacking can be classified into four patterns, including face-to-face stacking, wavelike stacking, crossing stacking, and mixing stacking, with an increasing difficulty in shear sliding, and HB plays an important role in supporting sliding layers. Straightforwardly, the stacking pattern-impact sensitivity relationship is rooted in the steric hindrance when sliding, and the face-to-face pi-pi stacking is preferred to design LSHEMs at the crystal level, due to the least steric hindrance or the lowest sliding barrier among the four patterns. This stacking has been extensively observed in traditional EMs, ECCs, and EISs, enlightening us to make a rule for designing new EMs with such stacking. However, it is still difficult to make the rule, attributed to the unclear relationship between molecular and stacking structures. Maybe, it will become increasingly feasible to achieve the rule by establishing a database with detailed information on molecules and related stacking patterns, increasing the amount of data by collecting experimental and predicted results, and combining with advanced machine learning technologies. Combining this article with a recent review of HB in EMs (Cryst. Growth Des. 2019, 19 (10), 5981-5997), an overall perspective of intermolecular interactions in energetic crystals with C, H, O, and N atoms could have been presented.","SURFACE ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIALS,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,HIGH EXPLOSIVES,CHARGE-DENSITY,AB-INITIO,PACKING,DERIVATIVES,COCRYSTAL,STABILITY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Crystallography,Materials Science",,3.924,"SURFACE,ELECTROSTATIC,POTENTIALS,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,DENSITY,MATERIAL,HIGH,EXPLOSIVES,CHARGE-DENSITY,AB-INITIO,PACKING,DERIVATIVES,COCRYSTAL,STABILITY",CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN,,

These crashes teach us that using drones for conservation is a contingent practice ensnaring humans, technologies, and animals. This article advances a crash theory in which pilots, conservation drones, and endangered megafauna are relata, or related actants, that intra-act, cocreating each other and a mutually constituted phenomena. These phenomena are entangled, with either reciprocal dependencies or erosive entrapments. The crashing of conservation drones and endangered species requires an ethics of care, repair, or reworlding. Diffractions, disruptions that expose difference, result from crashes and reveal the precarious manner by which technologies, laws, and discourses bring nature and culture together. To support crash theory, this article presents three ethnographic cases. A drone crash in the United Kingdom near white rhinoceroses while building machine learning training data exhibits the involvement of the electromagnetic spectrum; the threat of crashes in the Pacific Northwest near Puget Sound orcas discloses the impacts of drone laws; and drone crashes in Sri Lanka among Asian elephants presents the problems of technoliberal ideals around programming natural worlds.

In previous literature, machine learning models trained on either MRI or ultrasound data have been proposed to improve biopsy guidance and PCa detection. However, quantitative fusion of information from MRI and ultrasound has not been explored in depth in a large study. This paper investigates information fusion approaches between MRI and ultrasound to improve targeting of PCa foci in biopsies. Methods We build models of fully convolutional networks (FCN) using data from a newly proposed ultrasound modality, temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from 107 patients with 145 biopsy cores. The architecture of our models is based on U-Net and U-Net with attention gates. Models are built using joint training through intermediate and late fusion of the data. We also build models with data from each modality, separately, to use as baseline. The performance is evaluated based on the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting clinically significant PCa. Results Using our proposed deep learning framework and intermediate fusion, integration of TeUS and ADC outperforms the individual modalities for cancer detection. We achieve an AUC of 0.76 for detection of all PCa foci, and 0.89 for PCa with larger foci. Results indicate a shared representation between multiple modalities outperforms the average unimodal predictions. Conclusion We demonstrate the significant potential of multimodality integration of information from MRI and TeUS to improve PCa detection, which is essential for accurate targeting of cancer foci during biopsy. By using FCNs as the architecture of choice, we are able to predict the presence of clinically significant PCa in entire imaging planes immediately, without the need for region-based analysis. This reduces the overall computational time and enables future intra-operative deployment of this technology.","Information fusion,Multimodality training,Deep learning,Prostate cancer detection,Image-guided biopsy,Temporal enhanced ultrasound,Magnetic resonance imaging",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,BIOPSY",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture, namely DeepSeg, for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data. Methods The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists of two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder part to get the full-resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net architecture, different CNN models such as residual neural network (ResNet), dense convolutional network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this study. Results The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly.

Materials and methods: The retrospective study enrolled 120 patients (allocated to a training or a test set) with locally advanced cervical cancer who underwent CCRT between December 2014 and June 2017. All patients enrolled underwent MRI with nine sequences before treatment and again at the end of the fourth week of treatment. Responses were evaluated by MRI according to RECIST standards, and patients were divided into a responder group or non-responder group. For every MRI sequence, a total of 114 radiomic features were extracted from the outlined tumor habitat. On the training set, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select key features and to construct nine habitat signatures. Then, three kinds of machine learning models were compared and applied to integrate these predictive signatures and the clinical characteristics into a radiomic model. The discrimination ability, reliability, and calibration of our radiomic model were evaluated.
Results: The radiomic model, which consisted of three habitat signatures from sagittal T2 image, axial T1 enhanced-MRI image, and ADC image, respectively, has shown good predictive performance, with area under the curve of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.713-0.927) in the training set and 0.798 (95% CI: 0.678-0.917) in the test set. Meanwhile, the model proved to perform better than each single signature or clinical characteristic.
Conclusions: A radiomic model employing features from multiple tumor habitats held the ability for predicting treatment response in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer before commencing CCRT. These results illustrated a potential new tool for improving medical decision-making and therapeutic strategies.","cervical cancer,MRI,radiomics,treatment response prediction,concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy,precision medicine",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Oncology,,6.264,"HETEROGENEITY,IMAGES,CHINA,MRI",FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7214615?pdf=render,

Polymer microarrays enable the high-throughput comparison of material physical and chemical properties-such as surface chemistry and properties like cell attachment or protein adsorption-in order to identify correlations that can progress materials development. A challenge for this approach is to accurately discriminate between highly similar polymer chemistries or identify heterogeneities within individual polymer spots. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) offers unique potential in this regard, capable of describing the chemistry associated with the outermost layer of a sample with high spatial resolution and chemical sensitivity. However, this comes at the cost of generating large scale, complex hyperspectral imaging data sets. We have demonstrated previously that machine learning is a powerful tool for interpreting ToF-SIMS images, describing a method for color-tagging the output of a self-organizing map (SOM). This reduces the entire hyperspectral data set to a single reconstructed color similarity map, in which the spectral similarity between pixels is represented by color similarity in the map. Here, we apply the same methodology to a ToF-SIMS image of a printed polymer microarray for the first time. We report complete, single-pixel molecular discrimination of the 70 unique homopolymer spots on the array while also identifying intraspot heterogeneities thought to be related to intermixing of the polymer and the pHEMA coating. In this way, we show that the SOM can identify layers of similarity and clusters in the data, both with respect to polymer backbone structures and their individual side groups. Finally, we relate the output of the SOM analysis with fluorescence data from polymer-protein adsorption studies, highlighting how polymer performance can be visualized within the context of the global topology of the data set.","STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING,SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,BACTERIAL ATTACHMENT,DISCOVERY,CELLS,ARRAY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,6.755,"STRESS-CORROSION,CRACKING,SELF-ORGANIZING,MAPS,MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,BACTERIAL,ATTACHMENT,DISCOVERY,CELLS,ARRAY",ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7611022,

The required work for the development of new catalysts can be supported through the proper application of artificial intelligence to identify optimal compositions. A generic methodology for the application of machine learning to catalysis research is therefore outlined in this work. The catalytic oxidation of SO2 was used to exemplify the first iteration of this methodology. 1784 data points from 31 published papers were compiled into a databank. The inlet SO2 concentration ranged from 0 to 66 mol%. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained on the databank in order to predict SO2 conversion based on the catalyst composition and the reactor operating conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst mass: volumetric flowrate ratio (w/v), and feed composition). The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.6%. A preliminary screening step identified 3:1 V-Mg/SiO2 catalysts as exhibiting high conversion at 648 K. A multi-objective optimization was then performed on a single catalyst to identify solutions exhibiting high conversion and high productivity at 648 K while minimizing the catalyst cost. The optimal solution was predicted to be a 2.9 wt% V/0.2 wt% Mg/SiO2 catalyst operating at a w/v of 7.49 kg-cat center dot s/m(3) STP, achieving 100% SO2 conversion with a material cost among the bottom third of cost values. Artificial intelligence can then be employed to extract useful knowledge from published catalytic data and orient future search for novel catalyst development.","artificial neural network,catalyst design,multi-objective optimization,SO2 oxidation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Engineering,,1.819,"SULFUR-DIOXIDE,OXIDATION,VANADIUM,CATALYST,NEURAL-NETWORK,CO,OXIDATION,KINETIC-DATA,FLUE-GAS,DECOMPOSITION,OPTIMIZATION,NANOCATALYST,DIFFUSION",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,,
