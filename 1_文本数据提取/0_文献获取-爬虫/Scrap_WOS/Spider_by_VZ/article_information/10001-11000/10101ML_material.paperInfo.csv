1,From Absorption Spectra to Charge Transfer in Nanoaggregates of Oligomers with Machine Learning,14,6,6589-6598,"Roch Loic M.,Saikin Semion K.,Hase Florian,Friederich Pascal,Goldsmith Randall H.,Leon Salvador,Aspuru-Guzik Alan","Roch LM,Saikin SK,Hase F,Friederich P,Goldsmith RH,Leon S,Aspuru-Guzik A",Roch LM,10.1021/acsnano.0c00384,Harvard University,"Fast and inexpensive characterization of materials properties is a key element to discover novel functional materials. In this work, we suggest an approach employing three classes of Bayesian machine learning (ML) models to correlate electronic absorption spectra of nanoaggregates with the strength of intermolecular electronic couplings in organic conducting and semiconducting materials. As a specific model system, we consider poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polystyrene sulfonate, a cornerstone material for organic electronic applications, and so analyze the couplings between charged dimers of closely packed PEDOT oligomers that are at the heart of the material's unrivaled conductivity. We demonstrate that ML algorithms can identify correlations between the coupling strengths and the electronic absorption spectra. We also show that ML models can be trained to be transferable across a broad range of spectral resolutions and that the electronic couplings can be predicted from the simulated spectra with an 88% accuracy when ML models are used as classifiers. Although the ML models employed in this study were trained on data generated by a multiscale computational workflow, they were able to leverage experimental data.","machine learning,bayesian models,PEDOT,multiscale computational workflow,ab initio calculations,molecular dynamics,tight-binding formalism",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,16.207,"PEDOT-PSS,SEMICONDUCTING,POLYMER,OXYGEN,REDUCTION,THIN-FILMS,CONDUCTIVITY,STATE,3%2C4-ETHYLENEDIOXYTHIOPHENE,ENHANCEMENT,MORPHOLOGY,SULFONATE%29",ACS NANO,,

While ultraviolet (UV)-vis spectroscopy remains one of the key experimental methods for the interroga- tion of these materials, a rigorous bridge between simulated coarse -grained structures and spectroscopy has not been estab- lished. Here, we address this challenge by developing a method that can predict spectra of conjugated polymers directly from coarse -grained representations while avoiding repetitive proce- dures such as ad hoc back -mapping from coarse -grained to atom- istic representations followed by spectral computation using quantum chemistry. Our approach is based on a generative deep -learning model: the long -short-term memory recurrent neu- ral network (LSTM-RNN). The latter is suggested by the apparent similarity between natural languages and the mathematical struc- ture of perturbative expansions of, in our case, excited -state en- ergies perturbed by conformational fluctuations. We also use this model to explore the level of sensitivity of spectra to the coarse - grained representation back -mapping protocol. Our approach pre- sents a tool uniquely suited for improving postsimulation analysis protocols, as well as, potentially, for including spectral data as input in the refinement of coarse -grained potentials.","machine learning,coarse-grained modeling,conjugated polymers,molecular spectroscopy",Article,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES, 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,12.291,SIMULATIONS,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/25/13945.full.pdf,

This procedure, which is known as geolocation, is conventionally guided by expert knowledge of the biological evidence and therefore tends to be application specific, labour intensive and often subjective. Purely data-driven methods have yet to be fully realized in this domain, because in part of the lack of a sufficiently rich source of data. However, high throughput sequencing technologies can identify tens of thousands of fungi and bacteria taxa by using DNA recovered from a single swab collected from nearly any object or surface. This microbial community, or microbiome, may be highly informative of the provenance of the sample, but data on the spatial variation of microbiomes are sparse and high dimensional and have a complex dependence structure that render them difficult to model with standard statistical tools. Deep learning algorithms have generated a tremendous amount of interest within the machine learning community for their predictive performance in high dimensional problems. We present DeepSpace: a new algorithm for geolocation that aggregates over an ensemble of deep neural network classifiers trained on randomly generated Voronoi partitions of a spatial domain. The DeepSpace algorithm makes remarkably good point predictions; for example, when applied to the microbiomes of over 1300 dust samples collected across continental USA, more than half of geolocation predictions produced by this model fall less than 100 km from their true origin, which is a 60% reduction in error from competing geolocation methods. Moreover, we apply DeepSpace to a novel data set of global dust samples collected from nearly 30 countries, finding that dust-associated fungi alone predict a sample's country of origin with nearly 90% accuracy.","Citizen science,Machine learning,Microbiome,Non-homogeneous Poisson process,Spatial point pattern",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Mathematics,,,"UNITED-STATES,SEQUENCES,DUST",JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11765,

Using machine learning, we reported previously that the supramolecular chirality in self-assembled aggregates from VEVAG-pi-GAVEV type peptidic materials was most strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing of the alanine and valine residues. Herein, we build upon this idea to demonstrate through molecular-level experimental characterization and all-atom molecular modeling that varying the stereogenic centers of these residues has a profound impact on the optoelectronic properties of the supramolecular aggregates, whereas the variation of stereogenic centers of other residues has only nominal influence on these properties. This study highlights the synergy between computational and experimental insight relevant to the control of chiroptical or other electronic properties associated with supramolecular materials.","SELF-ASSEMBLIES,CHIRALITY,INVERSION,HANDEDNESS,NANOWIRES,DYNAMICS,SOLVENT,OLIGOTHIOPHENE,DIPEPTIDES,NANOFIBERS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Materials Science",,3.908,"SELF-ASSEMBLIES,CHIRALITY,INVERSION,HANDEDNESS,NANOWIRES,DYNAMICS,SOLVENT,OLIGOTHIOPHENE,DIPEPTIDES,NANOFIBERS",LANGMUIR,,

In the literature, various methods are proposed to divide the population into subgroups according to the heterogeneous effects of individuals. In this article, a new exploratory machine learning tool, named latent supervised clustering, is proposed to identify the heterogeneous subpopulations. In particular, we formulate the problem as a regression problem with subject specific coefficients, and use adaptive fusion to cluster the coefficients into subpopulations. This method has two main advantages. First, it relies on little prior knowledge and weak parametric assumptions on the underlying subpopulation structure. Second, it makes use of the outcome-predictor relationship, and hence can have competitive estimation and prediction accuracy. To estimate the parameters, we design a highly efficient accelerated proximal gradient algorithm which guarantees convergence at a competitive rate. Numerical studies show that the proposed method has competitive estimation and prediction accuracy, and can also produce interpretable clustering results for the underlying heterogeneous effect.for this article are available online.","Accelerated proximal gradient algorithm,Clustering analysis,Convex clustering,Machine learning,Precision medicine,Subpopulation identification",Article,"AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC, 732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",Mathematics,,3.347,"SUBGROUP,ANALYSES",JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS,,

The examination of CT might be employed for planning and managing the treatments for tumor in a proper way and for directing biopsies as well as other simply determined process. The Manual segmentation and Computed Axial Tomography (CT) image classification is a tedious task and time consuming process for large amount of data. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems take part in a fundamental role in the detection of liver disease in an early stage and therefore decrease death rate of liver cancer. In this paper an automatic CAD system is presented in three stage. In the first step, automatic liver segmentation and lesion's detection is carried out. Then, the next step is to extract features. At last, liver lesions classification into malignant and benign is done by using the novel contrast based feature-difference method. The extracted features from the lesion area with its surrounding normal liver tissue are based on intensity and texture. The lesion descriptor is obtained by considering the difference between the features of both lesion area and normal tissue of liver. Finally to categorize the liver lesions into malignant or benign a new SVM based machine learning classifier is trained on the new descriptors. The investigational outcome show hopeful improvement. Besides, the projected approach is insensitive to ranges of textures and intensity between demographics, imaging devices, and patients and settings. The classifier discriminates the tumor by comparatively high precision and offers a subsequent view to the radiologist.","Liver,Tumor,SVM classifier,Difference feature,Region growing",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Computer Science,,,"AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,SYSTEM,TEXTURE,ANALYSIS,TOMOGRAPHY,LESIONS,CANCER",SOFT COMPUTING,,

We identified over 100 genes, including known breast cancer biomarkers of intratumoral heterogeneity and the co-localization of tumour growth and immune activation, the expression of which can be predicted from the histopathology images at a resolution of 100 mu m. We also show that the algorithm generalizes well to The Cancer Genome Atlas and to other breast cancer gene expression datasets without the need for re-training.

NADES have benign properties (low volatility, flammability, toxicity, cost) and tailorable physicochemical properties (by altering the type and molar ratio of constituents); hence, they are often considered to be a green alternative to common organic solvents. Modeling the relation between their composition and properties is crucial though, both for understanding and predicting their behavior. Several efforts have been made to this end. This Review aims at structuring the present knowledge as an outline for future research. First, the key properties of NADES are reviewed and related to their structure on the basis of the available experimental data. Second, available modeling methods applicable to NADES are reviewed. At the molecular level, DFT and molecular dynamics allow density differences and vibrational spectra to be interpreted, and interaction energies to be computed. Additionally, properties at the level of the bulk medium can be explained and predicted by semi-empirical methods based on ab initio methods (COSMO-RS) and equation of state models (PC-SAFT). Finally, methods based on large datasets are discussed: models based on group-contribution methods and machine learning. A combination of bulk-medium and dataset modeling allows qualitative prediction and interpretation of phase equilibria properties on the one hand, and quantitative prediction of melting point, density, viscosity, surface tension, and refractive index on the other. Multiscale modeling, combining molecular and macroscale methods, is expected to strongly enhance the predictability of NADES properties and their interaction with solutes, and thus yield truly tailorable solvents to accommodate (bio)chemical reactions.","computational chemistry,deep eutectic solvents,solvent effects,structure-property relationships,sustainable chemistry",Review,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,8.868,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATIONS,DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL,THEORY,CHOLINE-CHLORIDE,IONIC,LIQUIDS,COSMO-RS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,PERTURBATION-THEORY,CO2,SOLUBILITIES,SURFACE-TENSION,SCREENING,MODEL",CHEMSUSCHEM,,

With regards to electronic transport and power factor (PF) calculations, the most widely adopted and computationally efficient method is the constant relaxation time approximation (CRT). This work goes beyond the CRT and adopts the proper, full energy and momentum dependencies of electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering to compute the electronic transport and perform PF optimization for a group of half-Heusler alloys.

Nonetheless, automatic segmentation is challenging due to the lack of clear prostate boundaries owing to the similar appearance of prostate and surrounding tissues and the wide variation in size and shape among different patients ascribed to pathological changes or different resolutions of images. In this regard, the state-of-the-art includes methods based on a probabilistic atlas, active contour models, and deep learning techniques. However, these techniques have limitations that need to be addressed, such as MRI scans with the same spatial resolution, initialization of the prostate region with well-defined contours and a set of hyperparameters of deep learning techniques determined manually, respectively. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic and novel coarse-to-fine segmentation method for prostate 3D MRI scans. The coarse segmentation step combines local texture and spatial information using the Intrinsic Manifold Simple Linear Iterative Clustering algorithm and probabilistic atlas in a deep convolutional neural networks model jointly with the particle swarm optimization algorithm to classify prostate and non-prostate tissues. Then, the fine segmentation uses the 3D Chan-Vese active contour model to obtain the final prostate surface.

Breast US images are converted to BIRADS-oriented feature maps (BFMs) using a distance-transformation coupled with a Gaussian filter. Then, the converted BFMs are used as the input of an SSDL network, which performs unsupervised stacked convolutional auto-encoder (SCAE) image reconstruction guided by lesion classification. This integrated multi-task learning allows SCAE to extract image features with the constraints from the lesion classification task, while the lesion classification is achieved by utilizing the SCAE encoder features with a convolutional network. We trained the BIRADS-SSDL network with an alternative learning strategy by balancing the reconstruction error and classification label prediction error. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluated it using two breast US image datasets. We compared the performance of the BIRADS-SSDL network with conventional SCAE and SSDL methods that use the original images as inputs, as well as with an SCAE that use BFMs as inputs. The experimental results on two breast US datasets show that BIRADS-SSDL ranked the best among the four networks, with a classification accuracy of around 94.23 +/- 3.33% and 84.38 +/- 3.11% on two datasets. In the case of experiments across two datasets collected from two different institutions/and US devices, the developed BIRADS-SSDL is generalizable across the different US devices and institutions without overfitting to a single dataset and achieved satisfactory results. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of the proposed method by varying the model training strategies, lesion boundary accuracy, and Gaussian filter parameters. The experimental results showed that a pre-training strategy can help to speed up model convergence during training but with no improvement of the classification accuracy on the testing dataset. The classification accuracy decreases as the segmentation accuracy decreases. The proposed BIRADS-SSDL achieves the best results among the compared methods in each case and has the capacity to deal with multiple different datasets under one model. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, BIRADS-SSDL could be promising for effective breast US computer-aided diagnosis using small datasets.","breast cancer,ultrasound,computer-aided diagnosis,BIRADS features,semi-supervised deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"IMAGE,SEGMENTATION,CLASSIFICATION,LESIONS,CANCER,TUMORS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01076,

This study investigates a deep learning-based method that generates synthetic CT volumes from T1-weighted MR Dixon images in support of MRI-based intrahepatic radiotherapy treatment planning. Training deep neutral networks for this purpose has been challenged by mismatches between CT and MR images due to motion and different organ filling status. This work proposes to resolve such challenge by generating 'semi-synthetic' CT images from rigidly aligned CT and MR image pairs. Contrasts within skeletal elements of the 'semi-synthetic' CT images were determined from CT images, while contrasts of soft tissue and air volumes were determined from voxel-wise intensity classification results on MR images. The resulting 'semi-synthetic' CT images were paired with their corresponding MR images and used to train a simple U-net model without adversarial components. MR and CT scans of 46 patients were investigated and the proposed method was evaluated for 31 patients with clinical radiotherapy plans, using 3-fold cross validation. The averaged mean absolute errors between synthetic CT and CT images across patients were 24.10 HU for liver, 28.62 HU for spleen, 47.05 HU for kidneys, 29.79 HU for spinal cord, 105.68 HU for lungs and 110.09 HU for vertebral bodies. VMAT and IMRT plans were optimized using CT-derived electron densities, and doses were recalculated using corresponding synthetic CT-derived density grids. Resulting dose differences to planning target volumes and various organs at risk were small, with the average difference less than 0.15 Gy for all dose metrics evaluated. The similarities in both image intensity and radiation dose distributions between CT and synthetic CT volumes demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its potential in supporting MRI-only radiotherapy treatment planning.","MRI guided radiation therapy,synthetic CT,intrahepatic cancer,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"BODY,RADIATION-THERAPY,LIVER",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991979,

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have become more popular in recent years and are now being used for a variety of applications. BCI data represents an individual's brain activity at a given time. Like many other kinds of data, BCI data can be utilized for malicious purposes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most popular brain activity acquisition methods of BCI applications. More specifically, BCI games, represent one of the main EEG applications. However, a malicious BCI application (e.g. game) could allow an attacker to take advantage of an unsuspecting user happily enjoying a game and record the user's brain activity; by analyzing this data, the attacker can infer private information and characteristics regarding the user, without his/her consent or awareness. This study is the first to demonstrate the ability to predict and infer meaningful personality traits and cognitive abilities by analyzing resting-state EEG (rsEEG) recordings of an individual's brain activity using a variety of machine learning methods. A comprehensive set of raw rsEEG scans, along with the dissociation level and executive function (EF) performance measures, for the 162 subjects were used in our evaluation. The best results we achieved were an accuracy of 73% for dissociation classification and less than 16% mean absolute error in predicting performance for all examined EFs.

However, current studies reveal that a small subset of gene makers can predict survivability for people with different breast cancer subtypes. In these studies, the selected genes are not necessarily functionally related, and hence, they may not correctly indicate the molecular mechanism behind breast cancer survivability. Also, several studies have shown there is a very low overlap between the biomarkers subsets for the same cancer disease. To improve the robustness of the classification performance and stability of detected biomarkers, recent methods involve taking existing knowledge on relations between genes into account in the classifier by aggregating functionality-related genes to produce discriminative gene subnetworks called network biomarkers.
Results In this paper, using a dataset of patients with different subtypes of breast cancer, we devised a novel network-based approach by integrating a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with gene expression data to (1) identify the network biomarkers (metagene) of breast cancer survivability and (2) predict the survivability of breast cancer patients based on their subtypes of breast cancer. Our method involves using the concept of seed genes for the identification of network biomarkers, ADASYN to solve class-imbalance, and random forest to predict the survivability of patients. We obtained the best classification performance with distance three from seed gene protein where the Gmean, F1-measure, and accuracy were respectively 0.900, 0.800, and 90.34%. The maximum size of a network biomarker with distance 3 is 9. A maximum of 34 genes is needed to accurately predict the survivability of breast cancer patients.
Conclusion This method can be used to identify the survivability of breast cancer patients using gene relationship networks. It has high prediction performance, including specificity and sensitivity for both cohorts of survivals and deceased.","Breast cancer subtypes,Survivability,Gene expression,Protein-protein interaction network",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Mathematical & Computational Biology,,,REVEALS,NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS,,

Nonetheless, designing ML models remains a challenge and requires further research as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy. In this study, we present a methodology to optimize the architecture and the feature configurations of ML models considering a supervised learning process. The proposed approach employs genetic algorithm (GA)-based integer-valued optimization for two ML models, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The selected variables in the DNN optimization problems are the number of hidden layers, their number of neurons and their activation function, while the type and the number of membership functions are the design variables in the ANFIS optimization problem. The mean squared error (MSE) between the predictions and the target outputs is minimized as the optimization fitness function. The proposed scheme is validated through a case study of computational material design. We apply the method to predict the fracture energy of polymer/nanoparticles composites (PNCs) with a database gathered from the literature. The optimized DNN model shows superior prediction accuracy compared to the classical one-hidden layer network. Also, it outperforms ANFIS with significantly lower number of generations in GA.

Because manual visual inspection is time consuming, expensive, and laborious, computer vision with deep learning techniques has recently been introduced as a promising tool for automatic damage detection and classification. However, damage localization is difficult in that close-up images do not contain the global structural context, while knowing the damage locations and the associated structural components is essential for interpreting the overall structural health. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) image data, the point clouds in the three-dimensional (3D) space with an extra dimension can be useful for bridge component recognition. However, previous research employing geometric features of bridges was only partially successful for relatively simple types of bridges without the background regions (e.g., ground, water, and vegetation). This study presents a methodology for automated bridge component recognition using deep learning. The proposed approach is designed for general bridges that may have curved decks or different pier heights. Furthermore, the proposed method can handle point clouds that have points in the background regions, significantly reducing the time-consuming preprocessing of the point cloud. For robust and automated segmentation, a set of point clouds is extracted from a bridge by subspace partition, and a deep leaning technique is employed to classify labels. Subsequently, the classification results are combined to determine the consensus label for each point based on a majority of estimated classes, thereby improving identification accuracy. The classification performance is experimentally validated using full-scale bridge.","bridge,deep learning,point cloud,semantic segmentation,terrestrial laser scanner",Article,"JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD, THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,4.76,"DETECTING,CONCRETE,CRACKS,INSPECTION,IDENTIFICATION,IMAGES",STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING,,

Its prevalence is promoted by lack of sufficient expertise to carry out accurate and timely diagnosis using the standard microscopy method. Where lab technicians are available, the results are usually subjective due to variations in expert judgement. To address this challenge, prompt interventions to improve disease control are needed. The emerging technologies of machine learning that can learn complex image patterns have accelerated research in medical image analysis. In this study, on a dataset of thick blood smear images, we evaluate and compare performance of three pre-trained deep learning architectures namely; faster regional convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN), single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) and RetinaNet through a Tensorflow object detection API. Data augmentation method was applied to optimise performance of the meta architectures. The possibility for mobile phone detector deployment was also investigated. The results revealed that faster R-CNN was the best trained model with a mean average precision of over 0.94 and SSD, was the best model for mobile deployment. We therefore deduce that faster R-CNN is best suited for obtaining high rates of accuracy in malaria detection while SDD is best suited for mobile deployment.","Deep learning,Malaria detection,Thick blood smear,Mobile detector",Article,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,,SN APPLIED SCIENCES,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-020-3000-0.pdf,

BCI systems based on Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) signals enable the user to convert their thoughts into actions without any voluntary muscle movement. Recently, Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the classification of MI signals. However, to produce good MI classification, it is necessary to effectively represent the signal as an input image to the CNN and train the deep learning classifier using large training data. Methods In this work, EEG signals are acquired over 16 channels and are filtered using a bandpass filter with the frequency range of 1 to 100 Hz. The processed signal is spatially filtered using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter. The spectrograms of the spatially filtered signals are given as input to CNN. A single convolutional layer CNN is designed to classify left hand, right hand, both hands, and feet MI EEG signals. The size of the training data is increased by augmenting the spectrograms of the EEG signals. Results The CNN classifier was evaluated using MI signals acquired from twelve healthy subjects. Results show that the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.18 +/- 2.51% for two-class (left hand and right hand) and 87.37 +/- 1.68% for four-class (Left hand, Right hand, Both hands, and Feet) MI.

Due to the strongly correlated nature of the 5f electrons, magnetic properties of these compounds depend sensitively on applied magnetic field and pressure, as well as on chemical doping. However, precise connection between the structure and magnetism in actinide-based materials is currently unclear. In this investigation, we established such structure-property links by assembling and mining two datasets that aggregate, respectively, the results of high-throughput density functional theory simulations and experimental measurements for the families of uranium- and neptunium-based binary compounds. Various regression algorithms were utilized to identify correlations among accessible attributes (features or descriptors) of the material systems and predict their cation magnetic moments and general forms of magnetic ordering. Descriptors representing compound structural parameters and cation f-subshell occupation numbers were identified as most important for accurate predictions. The best machine learning model developed employs the random forest regression algorithm. It can predict both spin and orbit moment size with root-mean-square error of 0.17 mu(B) and 0.19 mu(B), respectively.

The necessary issue in the clinical diagnostic process is to detect the causes of this disease (e.g., my body image, food, family, peers), which the therapist gradually comes to by verifying assumptions using proper methods and tools for diagnostic process. When a person is diagnosed with anorexia, a clinician (a doctor, a therapist or a psychologist) proposes a therapeutic diagnosis and considers the kind of treatment that should be applied. This process is also continued during therapeutic diagnosis. In both cases, it is recommended to apply computer-aided tools designed for testing and confirming the assumptions made by a psychologist. The paper aims to present the computer-aided therapeutic diagnosis method for anorexia. The proposed method consists of 4 stages: free statements of a patient about his/her body image, the general sentiment analysis of statement based on Recurrent Neural Network, assessment of the intensity of five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust (using the Nencki Affective Word List and conversion of words to their basic form), and the assessment of particular areas of difficulties-the sentiment analysis based on the dictionary approach was applied. Results The sentiment analysis of a document achieved 72% and 51% of effectiveness, respectively, for RNN and dictionary-based methods. The intensity of sadness (emotion) occurring within the dictionary method is differentiated between control and research group at the level of 10%. Conclusion The quick access to the sentiment analysis of a statement on the image of patient's body, emotions experienced by the patient and particular areas of difficulties of people prone to the anorexia nervosa disorders, may help to establish the diagnosis in a very short time and start an immediate therapy. The proposed automatic method helps to avoid patient's aversions towards the therapy, which may include avoiding patient-therapist communication, talking about less essential topics, coming late for the sessions.

Short introductions to protect the pipelines from these corrosion mechanisms are attached respectively and a thorough comparison is also conducted. Advantages and shortcomings of popular coating techniques are concluded based on published studies, and special focus is paid on the idea of cathodic protection. Modeling of the electrochemical reaction process is incorporated with transportation equations to govern the direct numerical studies on pipeline corrosions. Meanwhile, empirical models have been proposed to estimate corrosion growth from both deterministic and stochastic points of view. Finite element method has been proved to be an effective approach to simulate pipeline corrosion and further integrity analysis. Suggestions on future studies on the numerical modeling and simulation of pipeline corrosion have been provided on three directions: advanced multiphase flow simulation schemes, thermodynamic analysis and the usage of big data technique and machine learning algorithm. This paper is wished to be helpful for the scholars who are interested in the numerical studies on pipeline corrosion and the engineers who are supporting pipeline operation and integrity management.","PITTING CORROSION,PIPELINE STEEL,FINITE-ELEMENT,CREVICE CORROSION,CATHODIC PROTECTION,STAINLESS-STEELS,BURIED PIPELINES,THERMAL SPRAY,BARE STEEL,CRUDE-OIL",Article,"EDP SCIENCES S A, 17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,1.722,"PITTING,CORROSION,PIPELINE,STEEL,FINITE-ELEMENT,CREVICE,CORROSION,CATHODIC,PROTECTION,STAINLESS-STEELS,BURIED,PIPELINES,THERMAL,SPRAY,BARE,STEEL,CRUDE-OIL",OIL & GAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-REVUE D IFP ENERGIES NOUVELLES,https://ogst.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/articles/ogst/pdf/2020/01/ogst200032.pdf,

This paper selects the T2-MRI(T2-Magnetic Resonance Imaging) image and clinical data to diagnose Parkinson's disease and integrates the heterogeneous data into the improved convolution neural network. In this paper, convolution neural network is added to the Gabor filter to make the whole convolution neural network have better effect; the activation function is improved and adjusted, which means the traditional sigmoid function and the tanh function are discarded, and the Relu activation function is used to improve the neural network. It is proved by experiments that the heterogeneous data diagnosis of T2-MRI image and clinical data (the accuracy is 77.9%) is better than the simple image data diagnosis (the accuracy is71.2%).

36,SpeckleGAN: a generative adversarial network with an adaptive speckle layer to augment limited training data for ultrasound image processing,15,9,1427-1436,"Bargsten Lennart,Schlaefer Alexander","Bargsten L,Schlaefer A",Bargsten L,10.1007/s11548-020-02203-1,Hamburg University of Technology,"Purpose In the field of medical image analysis, deep learning methods gained huge attention over the last years. This can be explained by their often improved performance compared to classic explicit algorithms. In order to work well, they need large amounts of annotated data for supervised learning, but these are often not available in the case of medical image data. One way to overcome this limitation is to generate synthetic training data, e.g., by performing simulations to artificially augment the dataset. However, simulations require domain knowledge and are limited by the complexity of the underlying physical model. Another method to perform data augmentation is the generation of images by means of neural networks. Methods We developed a new algorithm for generation of synthetic medical images exhibiting speckle noise via generative adversarial networks (GANs). Key ingredient is a speckle layer, which can be incorporated into a neural network in order to add realistic and domain-dependent speckle. We call the resulting GAN architecture SpeckleGAN. Results We compared our new approach to an equivalent GAN without speckle layer. SpeckleGAN was able to generate ultrasound images with very crisp speckle patterns in contrast to the baseline GAN, even for small datasets of 50 images. SpeckleGAN outperformed the baseline GAN by up to 165 % with respect to the Frechet Inception distance. For artery layer and lumen segmentation, a performance improvement of up to 4 % was obtained for small datasets, when these were augmented with images by SpeckleGAN. Conclusion SpeckleGAN facilitates the generation of realistic synthetic ultrasound images to augment small training sets for deep learning based image processing. Its application is not restricted to ultrasound images but could be used for every imaging methodology that produces images with speckle such as optical coherence tomography or radar.","Deep learning,Synthetic image generation,Theory-guided neural networks,Speckle noise,Small datasets,Image segmentation",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7419454,

The data science methods used in this pipeline include the unsupervised machine learning (ML) method of self-organizing mapping (SOM) and the polymer molecular descriptor generator, both of which have been tailored to fit the polymer materials study. To demonstrate how this pipeline can be applied in this context, we used it on an organic photovoltaic (OPV) donor polymer database to investigate which properties or structural factors positively correlate with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV materials. This led us to discover that among the studied 8 properties and 11 molecular descriptors, only the photon energy loss (E-loss) and the number of fluorine atoms (nF) show strong positive correlations with PCE values, which is consistent with other verified studies. We also discovered that research trends can also be statistically visualized using our method. In our case study, we found that most of the studied OPV donor materials in the database have branched side chains and typically 7-12 non-hydrogen atoms, and high PCE materials usually have 6-9 aromatics rings as well.

The grinding experiments of nickel-based superalloy samples were carried out, and the prediction model of state parameters based on back propagation neural network was constituted. The prediction accuracy of the model was 93.58%. On this basis, the grinding experiments of nickel-based superalloy blade were conducted.

A key step for low-risk treatment is the accurate delineation of organs at risk in the planning imagery. The success of deep learning in image segmentation led to automated algorithms achieving human expert performance on certain datasets. However, such algorithms require large datasets for training and fail to segment previously unseen pathologies, where human experts still succeed. As pathologies are rare and large datasets costly to generate, we investigate the effect of: reduced training data, batch sizes and incorporation of prior knowledge. Methods The small data problem is studied by training a full-volume segmentation network with the reduced amount of data from the MICCAI 2015 head and neck segmentation challenge. To improve the segmentation, we evaluate the batch size as a hyper-parameter and first study and then incorporate a stacked autoencoder as shape prior into the training process. Results We found that using half of the training data (12 images of 25) results in an accuracy drop of only 3% for the segmentation of organs at risk. Also, the batch size turns out to be relevant for the quality of the segmentation when trained with less than half of the data. By applying PCA on the autoencoder's latent space we achieve a compact and accurate shape model, which is used as a regularizer and significantly improves the segmentation results. Conclusion Small training data of up to 12 training images is enough to train accurate head and neck segmentation models. By using a shape prior for regularization, the performance of the segmentation can be improved significantly on the full dataset. When training on fewer than 12 images, the batch size is relevant and models have to be trained much longer until convergence.","Multi-organ segmentation,Neural network,Head and neck,Radiotherapy,Shape prior",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Our work aims to realize the intelligence of the medical ultrasound equipment with limited computational capability, which is used for the assistant detection of breast lesions. We embed the high-computational deep learning algorithm into the medical ultrasound equipment with limited computational capability by two techniques: (1) lightweight neural network: considering the limited computational capability of ultrasound equipment, a lightweight neural network is designed, which greatly reduces the amount of calculation. And we use the technique of knowledge distillation to train the low-precision network helped with the high-precision network; (2) asynchronous calculations: consider four frames of ultrasound images as a group; the image of the first frame of each group is used as the input of the network, and the result is respectively fused with the images of the fourth to seventh frames. An amount of computation of 30 GFLO/frame is required for the proposed lightweight neural network, about 1/6 of that of the large high-precision network.

We examined the performance of AF detection by LP images with different segment window lengths by machine learning with convolutional neural network (CNN). LP images with a 32 x 32-pixel resolution of non-overlapping segments with lengths between 10 and 500 beats were created from R-R intervals of 24-h ECG in 52 patients with chronic AF and 58 non-AF controls as training data and in 53 patients with paroxysmal AF and 52 non-AF controls as test data. For each segment window length, discriminant models were made by fivefold cross-validation subsets of the training data and its classification performance was examined with the test data. Results In machine learning with the training data, the averages of cross-validation scores were 0.995 and 0.999 for 10 and 20-beat LP images, respectively, and > 0.999 for 50 to 500-beat images. The classification of test data showed good performance for all segment window lengths with an accuracy from 0.970 to 0.988. Positive likelihood ratio for detecting AF segments, however, showed a convex parabolic curve linear relationship to log segment window length and peaked at 85 beats, while negative likelihood ratio showed monotonous increase with increasing segment window length. Conclusions This study suggests that the optimal segment window length that maximizes the positive likelihood ratio for detecting paroxysmal AF with 32 x 32-pixel LP image is 85 beats.","Artificial intelligence,Atrial fibrillation,Convolutional neural network,Holter electrocardiogram,Lorenz plot,Machine learning,Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,2.905,"AGREEMENT,IMPACT",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7298777?pdf=render,

In the biomedical research, a number of stratification methods have been successfully applied and have assisted treatment process. Because of heterogeneity and complexity of medical data, it is very challenging to integrate them and make use of them in practical clinic. There are two major challenges of data integration. Firstly, since the biomedical data has a high number of dimensions, combining multiple data leads to the hard problem of vast dimensional space handling. The computation is enormously complex and time-consuming. Secondly, the disparity of different data types causes another critical problem in machine learning for biomedical data. It has a great need to develop an efficient machine learning framework to handle the challenges. Methods In this paper, we propose a fast-multiple kernel learning framework, referred to as fMKL-DR, that optimise equations to calculate matrix chain multiplication and reduce dimensions in data space. We applied our framework to two case studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient stratification and cancer patient stratification. We performed several comparative evaluations on various biomedical datasets. Results In the case study of AD patients, we enhanced significantly the multiple-ROIs approach based on MRI image data. The method could successfully classify not only AD patients and non-AD patients but also different phases of AD patients with AUC close to 1. In the case study of cancer patients, the framework was applied to six types of cancers, i.e., glioblastoma multiforme cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, and liver cancer. We efficiently integrated gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation. The results showed that the classification model basing on integrated datasets was much more accurate than classification model basing on the single data type. Conclusions The results demonstrated that the fMKL-DR remarkably improves computational cost and accuracy for both AD patient and cancer patient stratification. We optimised the data integration, dimension reduction, and kernel fusion. Our framework has great potential for mining large-scale cohort data and aiding personalised prevention.","Patient stratification,Alzheimer's diseases,Cancers,Multiple kernel learning,High dimensional data space,Dimension reduction",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Medical Informatics,,,"CLASSIFICATION,SUPPORT,FUSION",BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7296686?pdf=render,

We assume that only some of the pairwise translations have been seen (i.e. trained) and infer the remaining unseen translations (where training pairs are not available). We propose mix and match networks, an approach where multiple encoders and decoders are aligned in such a way that the desired translation can be obtained by simply cascading the source encoder and the target decoder, even when they have not interacted during the training stage (i.e. unseen). The main challenge lies in the alignment of the latent representations at the bottlenecks of encoder-decoder pairs. We propose an architecture with several tools to encourage alignment, including autoencoders and robust side information and latent consistency losses. We show the benefits of our approach in terms of effectiveness and scalability compared with other pairwise image-to-image translation approaches. We also propose zero-pair cross-modal image translation, a challenging setting where the objective is inferring semantic segmentation from depth (and vice-versa) without explicit segmentation-depth pairs, and only from two (disjoint) segmentation-RGB and depth-RGB training sets. We observe that a certain part of the shared information between unseen modalities might not be reachable, so we further propose a variant that leverages pseudo-pairs which allows us to exploit this shared information between the unseen modalities.","Image-to-image translation,Multi-domain,Multi-modal,Feature alignment,Mix and match networks,Zero-pair translation,Semantic segmentation,Depth estimation,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,13.284,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04294,

The damage caused by debris flows have increased with the expansion of human settlements and activity into the mountainous regions of China. In regards to risks from debris flows, previously unrecognized low-frequency debris flow catchments constitute an especially significant threat. According to our investigation, only about 500 catchments have debris flow records in >2000 catchments of Bailong River basin. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new methodology using Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can simultaneously input parameters related to geomorphological conditions and material conditions to better distinguish low-frequency debris flow catchments (LFDs) from medium-high frequency debris flow catchments (MHFDs). A total of 449 prototypical debris flow catchments, 15 parameters, and 9 commonly used learning machines were used to build identification models. Debris flow catchments are divided into 4 cases (LO1-LO4) based on different sample ratios of LFDs and MHFDs, which are input into each classifier one by one. Based on model evaluation, the CHAD model in the case LO2 performs best, which only uses five parameters (formation lithology index, land use index, vegetation coverage index, drainage density and landslide density index) to predict LFDs. The results indicate that LFDs are mainly distributed in areas with less landslide distribution and better vegetation coverage compared with MHFDs. However, the distribution of LFDs is concentrated on FLI (formation lithology index) 4, which is the weak lithology area. The tree classifier seems to be better at classifying fluvial processes. The model developed in this paper can help us quickly find LFDs in similar areas, and help to assess the risk of debris flows. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Radiation source path reconstruction is a critical procedure in HDR treatment planning. Manually identifying the source path is labor intensive and time inefficient. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a valuable imaging modality for image-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy due to its superb soft-tissue contrast for target delineation and normal tissue contouring. The purpose of this study is to investigate a deep-learning-based method to automatically reconstruct multiple catheters in MRI for prostate cancer HDR brachytherapy treatment planning. Methods Attention gated U-Net incorporated with total variation (TV) regularization model was developed for multi-catheter segmentation in MRI. The attention gates were used to improve the accuracy of identifying small catheter points, while TV regularization was adopted to encode the natural spatial continuity of catheters into the model. The model was trained using the binary catheter annotation images offered by experienced physicists as ground truth paired with original MRI images. After the network was trained, MR images of a new prostate cancer patient receiving HDR brachytherapy were fed into the model to predict the locations and shapes of all the catheters. Quantitative assessments of our proposed method were based on catheter shaft and tip errors compared to the ground truth. Results Our method detected 299 catheters from 20 patients receiving HDR prostate brachytherapy with a catheter tip error of 0.37 +/- 1.68 mm and a catheter shaft error of 0.93 +/- 0.50 mm. For detection of catheter tips, our method resulted in 87% of the catheter tips within an error of less than +/- 2.0 mm, and more than 71% of the tips can be localized within an absolute error of no >1.0 mm. For catheter shaft localization, 97% of catheters were detected with an error of <2.0 mm, while 63% were within 1.0 mm. Conclusions In this study, we proposed a novel multi-catheter detection method to precisely localize the tips and shafts of catheters in three-dimensional MRI images of HDR prostate brachytherapy. It paves the way for elevating the quality and outcome of MRI-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy.","catheter detection,deep learning,magnetic resonance imaging,prostate brachytherapy,total variation regularization",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"DOSE-RATE,BRACHYTHERAPY,LOCALIZATION,ARTIFACTS,RANSAC,TOOL,CT",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708403,

CS proves to be very useful for acquiring high dimensional image sets like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the efficiency of MR image reconstruction is affected due to slow acquisition of voluminous k-space data. To improve the quality of reconstructed image and increase the speed of the reconstruction, a novel algorithm namely Adaptive Sparse Reconstruction using Convolution Neural Network AsrCNN has been, proposed for MR Images. AsrCNN employs a CNN, which consists of four convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. The proposed algorithm reconstructs MR images with immense quality, as it is trained over a large dataset with adaptive gradient optimization. The training set consists of 32 x 32 image patches, which is used to create the dictionary by adaptively updating the weights. Subsequently, the dictionary is employed for recovery of sparse MR images corrupted with Gaussian noise. Patch-based approach in AsrCNN enables MR images of varied sizes to be processed without resizing. Experimental results for AsrCNN show an improvement of 1-5 dB in PSNR over previous state-of-art algorithms. Training has been done on GPU using Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (CAFFE) framework as it reduces significant amount of time in reconstructing images.","Compressive sensing,convolutional neural network,magnetic resonance imaging",Article,"WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD, 5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE","Computer Science,Engineering",,1.134,ULTRASOUND,JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS,,

This contribution to the system thermodynamics remains computationally challenging as it requires a diagonalization of the system's Hessian which scales as O(N-3) for a crystal made of N atoms. Here, to circumvent such a heavy computational task and make it feasible even for systems containing millions of atoms, the harmonic vibrational entropy of point defects is estimated directly from the relaxed atomic positions through a linear-in-descriptor machine learning approach of order O(N). With a size-independent descriptor dimension and fixed model parameters, an excellent predictive power is demonstrated on a wide range of defect configurations, supercell sizes, and external deformations well outside the training database. In particular, formation entropies in a range of 250k(B) are predicted with less than 1.6k(B) error from a training database whose formation entropies span only 25k(B) (training error less than 1.0k(B)). This exceptional transferability is found to hold even when the training is limited to a low-energy superbasin in the phase space while the tests are performed for a different liquid-like superbasin at higher energies.","EMBEDDED-ATOM METHOD,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,DIFFUSION,RELAXATION,IMPURITIES,CLUSTERS",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",Materials Science,,4.034,"EMBEDDED-ATOM,METHOD,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,DIFFUSION,RELAXATION,IMPURITIES,CLUSTERS",PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02869549/document,

For the evaluation of the development of fetal lung maturation degree, our study established a deep model from ultrasound images of four-cardiac-chamber view plane. Methods A two-stage transfer learning approach is proposed for the purpose of the study. A specific U-net structure is designed for the applied deep model. In the first stage, the model is to first learn the recognition of fetal lung region in the ultrasound images. It is hypothesized in our study that the development of fetal lung maturation degree is generally proportional to the gestational age. Then, in the second stage, the pretrained deep model is trained to accurately estimate the gestational age from the fetal lung region of ultrasound images. Results Totally 332 patients were included in our study, while the first 206 patients were used for training and the subsequent 126 patients were used for the independent testing. The testing results of the established deep model have the imprecision as 1.56 +/- 2.17 weeks on the gestational age estimation. Its correlation coefficient with the ground truth of gestational age achieves 0.7624 (95% CI 0.6779 to 0.8270,Pvalue < 0.00001).

This paper proposes a novel approach - FASTIGUE - for computationally super-efficient discrete fatigue crack growth analysis of large structures particularly for bondlines with high aspect ratios. The computational speed is considerably increased by outsourcing the finite element analysis into a pre-processing step in which the numerical model is solved for a comparatively small number of crack stages; providing the Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) for a set of auxiliary crack tip location permutations. 3D surface fitting of the auxiliary data provides the SIF ranges as continuous functions of the crack lengths. The fatigue crack growth simulation is performed independently from finite element analysis by utilising the SIF-functions within an explicit growth prediction scheme. The method is applied to a trailing edge crack in a 14.3 m wind turbine blade model and further validated against an analytical solution. It is demonstrated that the computation speed outperforms conventional fatigue analysis approaches relying on update-and-rerun schemes.,"Digital twin,Fatigue crack growth,Large-scale structures,Computational efficiency,Stress intensity factor",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Mechanics,,4.243,"WIND,TURBINE,BLADE,DELAMINATION,COMPOSITES,FRACTURE",ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS,,

Here we use multiple machine learning algorithms and a mechanistic model to identify the causative variables responsible for tool failure. We analyze one hundred and fourteen sets of experimental data for three commonly used alloys to evaluate the hierarchy of causative variables for tool failure. Three decision tree based algorithms are used to rank the hierarchy of the relative influence of six important friction stir welding variables on tool failure. The maximum shear stress is found to be the most important causative variable for tool failure. This is consistent with the effect of shear stress on the load experienced by the tool. The second most important factor is the flow stress which affects the plasticized material flow around the tool pin. All other variables are found to be significantly less important. Three algorithms also generate identical results and predict tool failure with the highest accuracy of 98%. A combination of mechanistic model, machine learning and experimental data can prevent tool failure accurately. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed material behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However, learning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity, is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning based hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network (FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed by using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the plasticity model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity is collected from different loading-unloading paths based on the concept of sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by multiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output, which leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the machine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen. The effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a series of numerical examples using both 2D and 3D finite element analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular modeling and simulations are invaluable tools, extensively used over the last two decades for the study of various properties of MOFs. In particular, Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been employed for the study of the gas uptake capacity of several MOFs at a wide range of different thermodynamic conditions. Despite the accurate predictions of molecular simulations, the accurate characterization and the high-throughput screening of the enormous number of MOFs that can be potentially synthesized by combining various structural building blocks is beyond present computer capabilities. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the use of an alternative approach, namely one based on an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) architecture that is capable of training machine learning and statistical predictive models for MOFs' chemical properties and estimate their predictive performance with confidence intervals. The architecture tries numerous combinations of different machine learning (ML) algorithms, tunes their hyper-parameters, and conservatively estimates performance of the final model. We demonstrate that it correctly estimates performance even with few samples (<100) and that it provides improved predictions over trying a single standard method, like Random Forests. The AutoML pipeline democratizes ML to non-expert material-science practitioners that may not know which algorithms to use on a given problem, how to tune them, and how to correctly estimate their predictive performance, dramatically improving productivity and avoiding common analysis pitfalls.

Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have shown the potential to bridge the gap between these two chasms due to their (i) low cost, (ii) accuracy, (iii) transferability, and (iv) ability to be iteratively improved. In this work, we further extend the scope of ML for atomistic simulations by capturing the temperature dependence of the mechanical and structural properties of bulk platinum through molecular dynamics simulations. We compare our results directly with experiments, showcasing that ML methods can be used to accurately capture large-scale materials phenomena that are out of reach of QM calculations. We also compare our predictions with those of a reliable embedded atom method potential. We conclude this work by discussing how ML methods can be used to push the boundaries of nano-scale materials research by bridging the gap between QM and experimental methods.","EMBEDDED-ATOM METHOD,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE,ELASTIC-CONSTANTS,SHEAR MODULUS,ENERGY,APPROXIMATION,SIMULATIONS,EQUATION,NICKEL,FIELDS",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"EMBEDDED-ATOM,METHOD,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE,ELASTIC-CONSTANTS,SHEAR,MODULUS,ENERGY,APPROXIMATION,SIMULATIONS,EQUATION,NICKEL,FIELDS",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

This propagating wave can be visualized through a series of images (time-frames in the context of computer-vision) in the time-space domain collectively referred to as the wavefield. An approach for the autonomous analysis of these wavefields is presented in this article for the purpose of impact diagnosis, that is, identifying the impact location and reconstructing the impact force time-history. The high spatio-temporal dimensionality of the wavefield mandates the use of deep neural networks for analysis; however, unlike the traditional object detection problem in computer-vision, the nature of the impact diagnosis problem requires the capturing of context from the wavefield evolution. This necessitates learning across multiple time-frames of the wavefield simultaneously rather than focusing independently on each frame. While scanning simultaneously across multiple time-frames provides indispensable information about the wave propagation phenomenon in terms of its interactions with geometric features, boundaries, and so on, it mandates the use of deep learning models that can analyze this complex phenomenon in both spatial and temporal domains. A unified CNN-RNN network architecture is employed in this article to address this issue of spatio-temporal information extraction. The proposed approach is verified using simulated wavefields obtained from the finite element analysis of a five-bay stiffened aluminum panel. In order to demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the model, simulated wavefields corresponding to highly idealized impact scenarios are used for training, whereas for testing, the ones corresponding to more realistic impacts are used. It is shown that by incorporating the physics-based concept of time-reversal in the recurrent part of the network, better network performance can be achieved. The potential extension of the proposed methodology to an end-to-end vision-based impact monitoring system is also discussed at the end.","Impact diagnosis,physics-inspired deep learning,full wavefield analysis,spatio-temporal information extraction,convolutional neural networks,recurrent neural networks,real-time impact monitoring system,highspeed camera,computer-vision",Review,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,5.861,"TIME-REVERSAL,ULTRASONIC,FIELDS,COMPOSITE,PANEL,TRANSVERSE,IMPACT,NEURAL-NETWORKS,INVERSE,PROBLEM,FORCE,QUANTIFICATION,DECONVOLUTION,LOCATION",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

The study consisted of two phases; first, it mainly explored the elders' health literacy of chronic health. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted to collect 60 samples of the Bunun elders. To analyze the data, a statistical software, version 22.0, was employed. The results indicated: (1) The older the person the higher the level of cultural acculturation; (2) the higher the degree of traditional culture, the lower the health knowledge scores; (3) the higher the health knowledge score, the better the self-care behavior of chronic diseases; (4) the health knowledge and self-care behavior of chronic disease predictors include age, education level, and occupation. The second phase mainly uses the factors of the traditional culture to influence health and understand the common health issues of the indigenous elders on chronic disease management and fall prevention. We interviewed 12 elders to summarize the important indigenous traditions. Then, based on the core health concept, we designed the cultural care for 12 weeks, in line with the course for the fall prevention and treatment for such elders. The tribal intervention is carried out with a quasi-experimental design. Via purposive sampling, some Atayal and Tsou participants, aged 55 years and above, 60 people, 30 in each ethnic group, were selected. The data, collected from pre- and post-intervention, were analyzed with the SPSS 22.0. Results showed that after the 12-week intervention course, the intervention group had better health cognitive scores, and the Tinett gait time was shortened. Meanwhile, we selected statistically significant variables include mood adaptation, ADL, IADL, health cognition, POMA-G and POMA-B, plus an ANN model established to incorporate these variables into the input variables to test whether the course can predict the falls and physical activities of the two ethnic groups. Ultimately, we observed that DNN model could accurately predict that the indigenous elders could have better mood adaption, IADL, health cognitive scores, and balance and gait performance, with accuracy of 80% in Tsou elders and 100% in Atayal elders. It is suggested that, in the future, in caring for the elders with chronic diseases in Taiwan, health education should avoid excessive professional terminology or esoteric language. This can be presented in pictures or multimedia languages to enhance the indigenous elders' health and life quality.","Indigenous elders,Health literacy,Traditional culture acculturation,Culturally congruent prevention fall course,Deep learning approach",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.344,"OLDER-PEOPLE,MEDICATION",JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,,

We show that this field-free switching is enabled by a synergistic effect of lateral geometrical confinement, interfacial Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and current-induced SOT. Both micromagnetic and atomistic understanding of the nucleation and growth kinetics of the reversed domain are established. Notably, atomically resolved spin dynamics at the early stage of nucleation is revealed using ASD simulations. A machine learning model is trained based on similar to 1000 groups of benchmarked micromagnetic simulation data.

Epilepsy patients suffer from severe detrimental effects like physical injury or depression due to unpredictable seizures. However, even in hospitals due to the high rate of false positives, the seizure alert systems are of poor help for patients as tools of seizure detection are mostly trained on unrealistically clean data, containing little noise and obtained under controlled laboratory conditions, where patient groups are homogeneous, e.g. in terms of age or type of seizures.

However, data scarcity has been the roadblock of applying deep learning models directly on prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Although model interpretation has been heavily studied for natural images for the past few years, there has been a lack of interpretation of deep learning models trained on medical images. In this paper, an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed and the model interpretation at various convolutional layers was systematically analyzed to improve the understanding of how CNN interprets multimodality medical images and the predictive powers of features at each layer. The problem of small sample size was addressed by feeding the intermediate features into a traditional classification algorithm known as weighted extreme learning machine (wELM), with imbalanced distribution among output categories taken into consideration. Methods The training data collection used a retrospective set of prostate MR studies, from SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenges held in 2017. Three hundred twenty biopsy samples of lesions from 201 prostate cancer patients were diagnosed and identified as clinically significant (malignant) or not significant (benign). All studies included T2-weighted (T2W), proton density-weighted (PD-W), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging. After registration and lesion-based normalization, a CNN with four convolutional layers were developed and trained on tenfold cross validation. The features from intermediate layers were then extracted as input to wELM to test the discriminative power of each individual layer. The best performing model from the tenfolds was chosen to be tested on the holdout cohort from two sources. Feature maps after each convolutional layer were then visualized to monitor the trend, as the layer propagated. Scatter plotting was used to visualize the transformation of data distribution. Finally, a class activation map was generated to highlight the region of interest based on the model perspective. Results Experimental trials indicated that the best input for CNN was a modality combination of T2W, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and DWIb50. The convolutional features from CNN paired with a weighted extreme learning classifier showed substantial performance compared to a CNN end-to-end training model. The feature map visualization reveals similar findings on natural images where lower layers tend to learn lower level features such as edges, intensity changes, etc, while higher layers learn more abstract and task-related concept such as the lesion region. The generated saliency map revealed that the model was able to focus on the region of interest where the lesion resided and filter out background information, including prostate boundary, rectum, etc. Conclusions This work designs a customized workflow for the small and imbalanced dataset of prostate mpMRI where features were extracted from a deep learning model and then analyzed by a traditional machine learning classifier. In addition, this work contributes to revealing how deep learning models interpret mpMRI for prostate cancer patient stratification.","convolutional neural network,model interpretation,prostate cancer mpMRI lesion classification,saliency map,small sample size",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"PROSTATE-CANCER,PREDICTION",MEDICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12331,

Biophysical in silico cardiac models offer a systematic approach for studying these multi-scale interactions. The computational cost of such models is high, due to their multi-parametric and nonlinear nature. This has so far made it difficult to perform model fitting and prevented global sensitivity analysis (GSA) studies. We propose a machine learning approach based on Gaussian process emulation of model simulations using probabilistic surrogate models, which enables model parameter inference via a Bayesian history matching (HM) technique and GSA on whole-organ mechanics. This framework is applied to model healthy and aortic-banded hypertensive rats, a commonly used animal model of heart failure disease. The obtained probabilistic surrogate models accurately predicted the left ventricular pump function (R-2 = 0.92 for ejection fraction). The HM technique allowed us to fit both the control and diseased virtual bi-ventricular rat heart models to magnetic resonance imaging and literature data, with model outputs from the constrained parameter space falling within 2 SD of the respective experimental values. The GSA identified Troponin C and cross-bridge kinetics as key parameters in determining both systolic and diastolic ventricular function.

In a multi-scale framework, closure models upscale unresolved sub-grid (mesoscale) physics and therefore encapsulate structure-property (S-P) linkages to predict performance at the macroscale. This work establishes a route to S-P linkage, proceeding all the way from imaged microstructures to flow computations in one unified level-set-based framework. Level sets are used to: (1) define embedded geometries via image segmentation; (2) simulate the interaction of sharp immersed boundaries with the flow field; and (3) calculate morphological metrics to quantify structure. Mesoscale dynamics is computed to calculate sub-grid properties, i.e., closure models for momentum and energy equations. The S-P linkage is demonstrated for two types of multi-material flows: interaction of shocks with a cloud of particles and reactive meso-mechanics of pressed energetic materials. We also present an approach to connect local morphological characteristics in a microstructure containing topologically complex features with the shock response of imaged samples of such materials.

Our model transforms multi-angle discrete features into structured data to find the inherent law of sEMG signal. Due to uneven information distribution of structured data, this model combines capsule network with attention mechanism to place emphasis on abundant information regions and reduce ancillary information loss. Extensive experiments show our model yields an improvement for sEMG signal recognition of almost 3% than capsule network and other neural networks under different conditions.

Here, we investigate the extent to which fUS faithfully reports local neuronal activation by combining fUS and two-photon microscopy (2PM) in a co-registered single voxel brain volume. Using a machine-learning approach, we compute and validate transfer functions between dendritic calcium signals of specific neurons and vascular signals measured at both microscopic (2PM) and mesoscopic (fUS) levels. We find that transfer functions are robust across a wide range of stimulation paradigms and animals, and reveal a second vascular component of neurovascular coupling upon very strong stimulation. We propose that transfer functions can be considered as reliable quantitative reporters to follow neurovascular coupling dynamics. Neurovascular coupling refers to changes in cerebral blood flow in response to neuronal stimulation, but to what extent this change can report neuronal activation is not known.

Regarding the key question about the composition x, at which there is a transition between the direct and indirect gaps, we performed ab initio calculations for various Zn concentrations and all possible atomic arrangements in eight- to 64-atom supercells. We show that, depending on the detailed Zn distribution (clustered, random, or uniform distribution), the alloy band gap can vary by as much as 1.27 eV. The band gap is indirect for clustered and random Zn arrangements in the supercell. For uniform Zn arrangements, the gap is also indirect, except for x < 0.5 and atom uniform arrangements excluding Zn-O-Zn nearest neighbor bridges, for which the direct gap can be lowered below the indirect gap by about 0.1 eV. The mechanisms of band-gap fluctuation, Zn clustering, and direct-indirect band-gap transitions are analyzed and explained in terms of atomic contributions to band structures by projecting Bloch functions onto localized Wannier functions. Simultaneously, cathodoluminescence measurements were performed on a set of ZnxMg1-xO multiquantum wells grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO substrates. We observed strong and broad emission bands, redshifting with increasing Zn concentration but featuring no clear-cut evidence for any direct to indirect band-gap crossover. We argue that these alloys are well suited for deep-UV optoelectronics, thanks to the rare combination of strong exciton binding energy, coupling to phonons, and carrier localization, which is favored by the marked flattening of the top valence bands by both short-range and long-range Zn-Zn interactions.","HEXAGONAL BORON-NITRIDE,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,OPTICAL-PROPERTIES,WANNIER FUNCTIONS,EPITAXIAL-GROWTH,ZNO,PHASE,MGO,MAGNESIUM,GAAS",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"HEXAGONAL,BORON-NITRIDE,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,OPTICAL-PROPERTIES,WANNIER,FUNCTIONS,EPITAXIAL-GROWTH,ZNO,PHASE,MGO,MAGNESIUM,GAAS",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,,

The idea of the DCNNAO is to extract the value of the objective function from the MD simulation snapshots directly by DCNN aided image process technique. Considering the huge memory requirement for MD result files, the main superiority of DCNNAO is to reduce the memory requirement and improve the efficiency of the optimization process by using a contour image (several hundred kilobytes) as the input instead of an MD result file (several hundred gigabytes). To complete this strategy, a Python script is written to generate required snapshots from result files automatically. Moreover, three boosted decision trees based optimization methods including surrogate optimization and heuristic algorithms are also implemented for comparison study. A detailed optimization result demonstrates that all the above methods can obtain an acceptable solution.

To address this issue, river sand can be replaced with sand manufactured from waste deposits. To facilitate manufactured-sand concrete production, this study proposes three tree-based models: one individual model (regression tree (RT)), and two ensemble models (random forest (RF) and gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT)) to predict its mechanical properties, such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), and splitting tensile strength (STS). These tree-based models were trained and tested on a dataset collected from previous literature. In addition, to understand the importance of each input variable on the mechanical properties of manufactured-sand concrete, the variable importance is calculated using the RF algorithm. The results show that the highest correlation coefficients are achieved by GBRT in predicting UCS (0.9887) and STS (0.9666), which respectively increase by 3.0%-10.8% and 16.0%-21.6% in comparison with the models in previous literature.

Predicting a patient's discharge outcome using baseline clinical information may help clinicians design more targeted treatment strategies and better anticipate the patient's assistive needs and discharge care plan. The objective of this study was to develop predictive models for four standardized clinical outcome measures (Functional Independence Measure, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Six-Minute Walk Test, Berg Balance Scale) during inpatient rehabilitation. Methods Fifty stroke survivors admitted to a United States inpatient rehabilitation hospital participated in this study. Predictors chosen for the clinical discharge scores included demographics, stroke characteristics, and scores of clinical tests at admission. We used the Pearson product-moment and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to calculate correlations among clinical outcome measures and predictors, a cross-validated Lasso regression to develop predictive equations for discharge scores of each clinical outcome measure, and a Random Forest based permutation analysis to compare the relative importance of the predictors. Results The predictive equations explained 70-77% of the variance in discharge scores and resulted in a normalized error of 13-15% for predicting the outcomes of new patients. The most important predictors were clinical test scores at admission. Additional variables that affected the discharge score of at least one clinical outcome were time from stroke onset to rehabilitation admission, age, sex, body mass index, race, and diagnosis of dysphasia or speech impairment.

Therefore, efforts need to be focused on the reduction of environmental impacts of concrete to boost its sustainability. To develop eco-friendly concrete mixtures, this study aimed to investigate the mixture design of sustainable concrete. To this end, six machine learning techniques, including water cycle algorithm, soccer league competition algorithm, genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and regression, are applied in order to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The accuracy of these methods is compared based upon performance indicators (e.g., mean absolute error), and the equation generated by the most precision model is utilized for mixture proportioning. Consequently, compressive strength, cost, environmental impacts, including embodied CO2 emission, and energy and resource consumptions are taken into account as sustainability criteria. To integrate these criteria, six types of objective functions are defined and applied and the most efficient sustainable objective function is used to estimate the mixture design of sustainable concrete. Ultimately, the estimated mixtures are compared based on the sustainability index defined by previous studies. The results indicate that water cycle algorithm is the most accurate model with the mean absolute error of 2.86 MPa. Besides, the quadratic distance to the ideal level is the most effective sustainable objective function. Furthermore, increasing the content of cement and super-plasticizer in mixture design deteriorate the sustainability index. Eventually, 16 sustainable mixture proportions are designed, and the most sustainable, the most economical, the eco-friendliest, and the least material-consuming mixtures are presented and compared based on their sustainability indices.

However, the practical applications of this process still suffer from high production costs owing to the expensive raw materials required and the severe operating conditions. Herein, we propose an economically attractive methanol production process that also works to sequester CO2, developed through technoeconomic optimization. This economically optimized process design and the associated operating conditions were simultaneously obtained from among thousands of possible configurations using a superstructure optimization. A modified machine learning-based optimization algorithm was also employed to efficiently achieve this complex superstructure optimization. The optimum process design involves a multistage reactor together with an interstage product recovery system and substantially improves the CO2 conversion to greater than 52%. Consequently, the revenue obtained from methanol production changes from a $4.3 deficit to a $2.5 profit per ton. In addition, the proposed process is capable of generating the same amount of methanol with only half the CO2 emissions associated with conventional methanol production methods. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is also provided along with the optimum process design to identify the influence of various technoeconomic parameters.","Bayesian optimization,CO2,hydrogenation,Methanol,superstructure,technoeconomic optimization",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Energy & Fuels,Nuclear Science & Technology",,4.913,"CARBON-DIOXIDE,HYDROGENATION,MULTIOBJECTIVE,OPTIMIZATION,SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,CAPTURED,CO2,CATALYST,REACTOR,CONVERSION,SIMULATION,SOLVENT,SYSTEMS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,,
