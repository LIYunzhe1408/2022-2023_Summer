Electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI is one of the promising solutions due to its convenient and portable instruments. Despite the extensive research of EEG in recent years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to its nature of noise and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relations between EEG signals and specific brain activities. Most existing works either only consider EEG as chain-like sequences while neglecting complex dependencies between adjacent signals or requiring complex preprocessing. In this paper, we introduce two deep learning-based frameworks with novel spatio-temporal preserving representations of raw EEG streams to precisely identify human intentions. The two frameworks consist of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks effectively exploring the preserved spatial and temporal information in either a cascade or a parallel manner. Extensive experiments on a large scale movement intention EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3 145 160 EEG records) have demonstrated that the proposed frameworks achieve high accuracy of 98.3% and outperform a set of state-of-the-art and baseline models. The developed models are further evaluated with a real-world brain typing BCI and achieve a recognition accuracy of 93% over five instruction intentions suggesting good generalization over different kinds of intentions and BCI systems.","Electroencephalography,Electrodes,Brain modeling,Feature extraction,Biological neural networks,Recurrent neural networks,Brain-computer interface (BCI),electroencephalography (EEG),intention recognition,spatial information,temporal information",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,11.507,"MOTOR-IMAGERY,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM,NETWORK,SIGNALS,ICA",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS,,

The high volume of spectral bands allows discrimination between various materials with high details. Moreover, by utilizing the spatial features of image such as shape, texture and geometrical structures, the land cover discrimination will be improved. So, fusion of spectral and spatial information can significantly improve the HSI classification. In this work, the spectral-spatial information fusion methods are categorized into three main groups. The first group contains segmentation based methods where objects or super-pixels are used instead of pixels for classification or the obtained segmentation map is used for relaxation of the pixel-wise classification map. The second group consists of feature fusion methods which are divided into six sub-groups: features stacking, joint spectral-spatial feature extraction, kernel based classifiers, representation based classifiers, 3D spectral-spatial feature extraction and deep learning based classifiers. The third fusion methods are decision fusion based approaches where complementary information of several classifiers are contributed for achieving the final classification map. A review of different methods in each category, is presented. Moreover, the advantages and difficulties/disadvantages of each group are discussed. The performance of various fusion methods are assessed in terms of classification accuracy and running time using experiments on three popular hyperspectral images. The results show that the feature fusion methods although are time consuming but can provide superior classification accuracy compared to other methods. Study of this work can be very useful for all researchers interested in HSI feature extraction, fusion and classification.","Hyperspectral image,Feature fusion,Decision fusion,Classification",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,12.707,"JOINT,COLLABORATIVE,REPRESENTATION,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINES,LOCAL,BINARY,PATTERNS,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,PRESERVING,PROJECTION,FRAMEWORK,AUGMENTATION,CLASSIFIERS,TRANSFORM,SUBSPACE",INFORMATION FUSION,,
3,Emotion recognition using multi-modal data and machine learning techniques: A tutorial and review,59,,103-126,"Zhang Jianhua,Yin Zhong,Chen Peng,Nichele Stefano","Zhang JH,Yin Z,Chen P,Nichele S",Zhang JH,10.1016/j.inffus.2020.01.011,Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"In recent years, the rapid advances in machine learning (ML) and information fusion has made it possible to endow machines/computers with the ability of emotion understanding, recognition, and analysis. Emotion recognition has attracted increasingly intense interest from researchers from diverse fields. Human emotions can be recognized from facial expressions, speech, behavior (gesture/posture) or physiological signals. However, the first three methods can be ineffective since humans may involuntarily or deliberately conceal their real emotions (so-called social masking). The use of physiological signals can lead to more objective and reliable emotion recognition. Compared with peripheral neurophysiological signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals respond to fluctuations of affective states more sensitively and in real time and thus can provide useful features of emotional states. Therefore, various EEG-based emotion recognition techniques have been developed recently. In this paper, the emotion recognition methods based on multi-channel EEG signals as well as multi-modal physiological signals are reviewed. According to the standard pipeline for emotion recognition, we review different feature extraction (e.g., wavelet transform and nonlinear dynamics), feature reduction, and ML classifier design methods (e.g., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, the EEG rhythms that are highly correlated with emotions are analyzed and the correlation between different brain areas and emotions is discussed. Finally, we compare different ML and deep learning algorithms for emotion recognition and suggest several open problems and future research directions in this exciting and fast-growing area of AI.","Emotion recognition,Affective computing,Physiological signals,Feature dimensionality reduction,Data fusion,Machine learning,Deep learning",Review,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,12.707,"EEG,SIGNAL,CLASSIFICATION,NEURAL-NETWORK,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,FEATURE-SELECTION,MENTAL,WORKLOAD,APPROXIMATE,ENTROPY,FACIAL,EXPRESSIONS,AUTOMATIC-ANALYSIS,SENTIMENT,ANALYSIS,MIXTURE,MODEL",INFORMATION FUSION,,

These buildings must be maintained to prolong their service life and monitored continuously for possible signs of building damages. Determining the compressive strength is essential for predicting the remaining service life of museums because monumental museum buildings usually comprise load-bearing masonry walls. This study analysed the applicability of three machine learning techniques as alternative methods for predicting the compressive strength of masonry constructions. A database was established by performing experimental testing on 44 masonry specimens. In the nondestructive techniques used, the ultrasonic pulse velocity and the rebound number were inputs and the compressive strength of masonry unit (fmu was the desired output. The remaining compressive strength of a museum was determined using commonly available nondestructive testing apparatus. The model predictions obtained through nondestructive measurements were compared with the experimental results obtained through the destructive testing of masonry units in the laboratory. The proposed approach was compared with traditional empirical models and commonly used machine learning techniques. The analyses revealed that machine learning techniques are robust, can successfully be used for the prediction of the remaining compressive strength of historical constructions, and thus can provide decision support for inspection professionals.","Historic buildings,Structural health monitoring,Compressive strength,Nondestructive testing,Neural networks,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Engineering,,2.67,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,REINFORCED-CONCRETE,BEAMS,HIGH-PERFORMANCE,CONCRETE,DAMAGE,DETECTION,SHEAR-STRENGTH,FUZZY,MODEL,BEHAVIOR,WALLS,ELASTICITY,MODULUS",JOURNAL OF CIVIL STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING,,

To reduce environmental impact and overall energy consumption, and to stabilize the power requirements, it is recommended to recover surplus heat, store energy, and integrate renewable energy production. To control these operations continuously in a complex energy system, an intelligent energy management system can be employed using operational data and machine learning. In this work, we have developed an artificial neural network based technique for modelling operational CO2 refrigerant based industrial cooling systems for embedding in an overall energy management system. The operating temperature and pressure measurements, as well as the operating frequency of compressors, are used in developing operational model of the cooling system, which outputs electrical consumption and refrigerant mass flow without the need for additional physical measurements. The presented model is superior to a generalized theoretical model, as it learns from data that includes individual compressor type characteristics. The results show that the presented approach is relatively precise with a Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) as low as 5%, using low resolution and asynchronous data from a case study system. The developed model is also tested in a laboratory setting, where MAPE is shown to be as low as 1.8%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A compositional field-scaled numerical simulation model is structured to investigate the fluid flow dynamics of an on-going CO2-EOR project in the Farnsworth Unit (Texas, US). Artificial-neural-network (ANN) based proxy models are trained to predict time-series project responses including hydrocarbon production, CO2 storage and reservoir pressure data. The outputs of the proxy model not only serve for evaluating the objective function but also provide significant physical and economic constraints to the optimization processes. In this work, the objective function considers both the oil recovery and CO2 sequestration volume. Moreover, the project net present values (NPV) and reservoir pressure are employed to screen the optimum solutions. The proposed optimization workflow couples the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the ANN proxies to maximize the prescribed objective function. The results of this work indicate that the presented workflow is a more robust approach to co-optimize the CO2-EOR projects. Results show that the optimized case can store about 94% of the purchased CO2 within Farnsworth Unit. Comparing to the baseline case, the CO2 storage amount of the found optimal case increases by 21.69%, and the oil production improves 8.74%. More importantly, the improvements in CO2 storage and hydrocarbon recovery lead to 8.74% greater project NPV and 19.79% higher overall objective function value, which confirms the success of the developed co-optimization approach for CO2 sequestration and oil recovery.

A largo plazo, una alta incidencia puede generar y reforzar un círculo vicioso de desigualdad y pobreza. En ese sentido, evaluar el impacto de las intervenciones para reducir la DCI es importante para determinar si las políticas son efectivas o no.  Objetivo:  Evaluar el impacto de la suplementación con micronutrientes sobre los niveles de desnutrición cronica infantil en el Perú en el periodo 2014-2017. Material y metodos: Se utilizó información de los niños y niñas de 6 a 59 meses de edad de la Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar (ENDES) de los años del 2014 al 2017. Se aplicó una estimación cuantitativa de naturaleza econometrica que consta de dos pasos. Primero se balancea la muestra mediante dos metodologias: Entropy Balancing (EB) y Machine Learning (ML). Luego se realizan estimaciones de diferencias para dos variables, la probabilidad de sufrir DCI y el puntaje Z entre quienes sufren DCI.  Resultados:  El haber realizado algun consumo de micronutrientes incrementa la probabilidad de sufrir desnutrición cronica. Se encuentran efectos positivos sobre el puntaje Z en los niños con DCI a partir de 54,1 sobres consumidos. Cuando se incluyen variables de control, los resultados no varian considerablemente.  Conclusiones:  La suplementación con micronutrientes tiene efectos negativos en la reducción de la DCI. Un impacto positivo solo se encuentra en los niños con DCI y que consumen más de 54,1 sobres; para cantidades menores, el consumo empeora los niveles de DCI.", Micronutrients; child nutrition disorders; nutrition programs and policies; infant nutritional physiological phenomena; Peru , research-article ,,,,,,,https://revistas.upch.edu.pe/index.php/RMH/article/download/3803/4283,

In addition, compared with previous single finger estimation in an experimental environment, we extend the approach to multiple finger force estimation, which can be used for applications such as human grasping analysis. Four algorithms are used, c.q., Gaussian process, convolutional neural networks, neural networks with fast dropout, and recurrent neural networks with fast dropout, to model a mapping from images to the corresponding labels.

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically segment the femoral head. The proposed method consists of two parts, firstly, mean filtering, morphological processing and least squares operation are used to detect the ilium and acetabular bone baseline to coarsely obtain the region of interest of the femoral head, then followed by an improved fully convolutional neural network named FNet which integrates the convolution encoder-decoder architecture, pooling indices and residual connection operation for more accurate segmentation. FNet is trained in a cascaded way, which can help the network learn more features with a limited dataset and thus further improve the segmentation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an average dice, recall and IoU value of 0.946, 0.937 and 0.897. Moreover, the features learned by convolutional layers are visualized to demonstrate that FNet can focus on significant features, which is helpful to restore the contour of the femoral head more precisely.

First, we demonstrated that atelocollagen (AC) has desirable physical properties for printing compared to native collagen (NC). AC gel exhibited weakly elastic and temperature-responsive reversible behavior forming a soft cream-like structure with low yield stress, whereas NC gel showed highly crosslinked and temperature-responsive irreversible behavior resulting in brittleness and high yield stress. Next, we discovered a universal relationship between the mechanical properties of ink and printability that is supported by machine learning: a high elastic modulus improves shape fidelity and extrusion is possible below the critical yield stress; this is supported by machine learning. Based on this relationship, we derived various formulations of naturally derived bioinks that provide high shape fidelity using multiple regression analysis. Finally, we produced a 3D construct of a cell-laden hydrogel with a framework of high shape fidelity bioink, confirming that cells are highly viable and proliferative in the 3D constructs.","atelocollagen,3D bioprinting,bioinks,hydrogel,machine learning,rheological properties",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,11.298,"VISCOELASTIC,PROPERTIES,CROSS-LINKING,COLLAGEN,HYDROGELS,ALGINATE",BIOFABRICATION,,

Managers' previous making-do decisions and the resulting consequence, delay, can have a significant impact on future making-do decisions. To understand how managers' experience with delay impacts their making-do decision and how it is handled differently in different countries, two surveys were administered, one in China and one in the United States (US), and 260 usable responses were collected. This study used: (1) the Mann-Whitney U test to examine whether delaying task starting time, when lacking precondition readiness, pays off with shorter delays; (2) a random forest approach to find important causes of delay that contribute to a making-do decision; and (3) an entropy-based decision tree to determine how much uncertainty in making-do decisions can be reduced by knowing managers' experience with delays in past projects. Results showed that in the United States, managers who preferred the making-do approach experienced up to 60% less task duration delay; whereas Chinese managers who preferred making-do experienced up to 100% more task duration delay due to lack of readiness in labor, equipment, material, management, and information flow. The contributions to the body of knowledge are the development of a random forest approach to quantitatively examine the relative importance of the causes of delay to the making-do decision and to reveal the fundamental differences in culture and management traditions that cause the difference between the two countries. The methods presented in this study will enable others to use a similar random forest approach repetitively for classification, prediction, and variable selection problems in civil engineering. The findings of this study will help project managers better understand underlying factors that trigger making-do decisions in China and the United States, and have more efficient collaboration and communication when they work on projects located in a foreign country.","Making-do,Random forest,Decision tree,Information theory,China,United States,Construction",Article,"ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",Engineering,,6.212,"CONSTRUCTION,BENCHMARKING,REWORK",JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING,https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000776,

In addition to its impact on the crystal structure, octahedral tilting is related to functional properties, including dielectric permittivity, ferroelectricity, magnetic properties, and metal-insulator transitions. By relating a selection of physical parameters (e.g., atomic radii, electronegativity) with mathematical operations (e.g., addition, exponentiation), we identify an analytical equation that correctly predicts the octahedral tilting classification for 49 perovskite oxides in a dataset of 60 materials. Using the same training dataset, we additionally fit and compare seven models generated by other common machine learning methods.

Large cracks, such as those with large crack opening displacements (COD) can be detected by strain peaks or singularities along the measurement length of distributed sensors. Microcracks do not provide visible pronounced local peaks along the length of measured distributed strains. The peaks corresponding to microcracks are submerged within the measurement noise due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of BS systems. Deep learning (DL) methods have the potential to automatically extract feature representations from data exhibiting lower SNRs, and improve classification accuracy. Accordingly, a novel DL method is proposed in this study to improve the crack detection sensitivity of the BS-based DOFS. Development of the proposed DL method includes construction of model architecture, design of a training algorithm and the detection process. A 15 m-long wide-flange steel beam with artificial defects is built and employed in this study. A comprehensive experimental program is undertaken in order to train, validate and test the generality of the proposed DL method. Experimental results demonstrate that the DL method is capable of extracting highly discernable microcrack features from the distributed strains, and distinguish the crack-induced local peaks from the noise.

Characterizing their surface is essential to ensure their quality and to optimize their fabrication process. This is realized by optical surface profilers thanks to their vertical resolution, short measurement time and areal information. However, when measuring non-flat surfaces, errors appear caused by aberrations of the microscope objective used in such systems, which significantly limit the achievable quality of the manufactured spherical surfaces. Approaches have been proposed to tackle these errors, but none of them demonstrated its validity for measurements of high quality microlenses. In this work, we demonstrate that the surface error depends on the surface position within the field of view of the microscope objective and on the surface slope. We then explain how to record the value of this error experimentally: this can be done by measuring a reference ball placed at different positions in the field of view. We finally use a machine learning algorithm to fit the experimental data in order to correct subsequent measurements. We apply this approach to measurements performed by a 20x numerical aperture 0.6 microscope objective of a confocal microscope. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by showing that the surface error corresponds to a RMS wavefront error of lambda/7 before correction and of lambda/50 after correction for glass microlenses used in the visible range. This method thus allows the use of high numerical aperture microscope objectives for an accurate characterization of microlenses. Likewise, the fabrication capability of microlenses in terms of slope and quality is greatly extended, which is especially important for aspheres or freeforms.","confocal microscopy,microlens surface measurement,areal surface topography,aspherical microlens,surface measurement error",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,2.11,"TWYMAN-GREEN,INTERFEROMETER",MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/ab786b,

However, the traditional inspection methods of checking defects with visual features cannot meet engineering needs sufficiently. Although deep-learning methods have recently demonstrated a remarkable improvement in image classification and recognition, there are still difficulties, such as the countless parameters and large model training sets needed by these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel crack extraction algorithm for automatic segmentation of cracks and noise using multi-layer features extracted from a fully convolutional network and a naive Bayes data fusion (NB-FCN) model. The bridge images in both the training and testing datasets are taken using an in-house designed high-precision image acquisition device, called Bridge Substructure Detection 10 (BSD-10). BSD-10 is applied to collect 7200 images from ten existing bridges under different illuminants and distances. After gathering the crack datasets, the crack and noise models of the NB-FCN are trained, respectively, with multiple iterations. Next, the skeleton and continuous boundary of a crack are recognized. Then the crack length and width are calculated using electronic distance measurement to verify the error rate of the proposed method. Compared to up-to-date machine-learning-based algorithms, i.e. the crack tree algorithm, the random structured forests algorithm, the relatively competitive convolutional neural networks algorithm, and the fusion convolutional neural network algorithm, the significant superiority of the NB-FCN algorithm in terms of recognition accuracy, computation time, and error rates is illustrated based on different types of crack images of handwriting, peel off, water stains and repair traces. The NB-FCN algorithm is verified with 7200 datasets of bridge substructures collected from 20 in-service bridges under various circumstances. In general, the recognition results show that the proposed algorithm demonstrates a remarkable performance compared to other recent algorithms.","bridge inspection,crack extraction,machine learning,deep learning,fully convolutional network,naive Bayes",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,2.11,"DAMAGE,DETECTION,DEEP,INSPECTION",MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,,

A total of 630 finite element limit equilibrium analysis were completed to provide datasets of training and testing for preparation of the ANN-based predictive models. The database consisted of 504 training datasets (80% of the database) and 126 testing datasets (20% of the database). To construct an optimized ANN structure, variables of ANN algorithm such as a number of neurons in hidden layer and the number of hidden layers were changed (e.g. with a series of trial and error process). The input parameters that used in the analysis include setback distance ratio (b/B), the undrained shear strength of the cohesive soil (C-u), applied stresses on the slope (F-y) and slope angle (beta) while the final output was the value of SF. The predicted results for datasets from ANN models were assessed based on several well-known statistical indices namely, R-2, RMSE and VAF. Also, in order to evaluate the performance of predicted network two ranking systems of (1) colour intensity rating (CIR) and (2) total ranking method (TRM), i.e. based on the result of statistical indices, were utilized. The optimal architecture of 4 x 6 x 1 was found for the ANN structure. After the performance of the optimized ANN model, the results are provided as a simple tansig formula which can be used for further application of engineering purposes. In the optimized ANN network and based on R-2, RMSE and VAF, values of (0.999, 0.0350 and 99.9978) and (0.999, 0.0379 and 99.998) were found, respectively, for both of the normalized training and testing datasets. This proves the excellent performance of the proposed ANN model in estimating the SF of the slope.

Deep learning is rapidly expanding with respect to applications in medical fields. In this study, we apply the artificial neural network (ANN)-based deep learning approach to coloration support for fabricating maxillofacial prostheses.
Methods: We compared two machine learning algorithms, ANN-based deep learning and the random forest algorithm, to determine the compounding amount of pigment. We prepared 52 silicone elastomer specimens of varying colors and measured the CIE 1976 L* a* b* color space information using a spectrophotometer on the input dataset. The output of these algorithms indicated the compounding amount of four pigments. According to the algorithms' pigment compounding predictions, we prepared the specimens for validation analysis and measured the CIE 1976 L* a* b* values. We determined the color differences between the real skin color of five research participants (22.3 +/- 1.7 years) and that of the silicone elastomer specimens fabricated based on the algorithm predictions using the CIEDE00 Delta E-00 color system.
Results: The color differences (Delta E-00 value) between the real skin color and silicone elastomer validation specimens were 3.45 +/- 0.87 (ANN) and 5.54 +/- 1.41 (random forest), which indicates that the deep ANN approach produced superior results with respect to the Delta E-00 value compared with the random forest algorithm.
Conclusions: These results suggest that applying deep ANN is a promising technique for the coloration of maxillofacial prostheses. (C) 2019 Japan Prosthodontic Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, nucleus segmentation plays a vital role to classify the WBC image and it is an important part of the medical diagnosis system. In this study, color space conversion and k-means algorithm based new WBC nucleus segmentation method is proposed. Then we localize the WBC based on the location of segmented nucleus to separate them from the entire blood smear image. To classify the localized WBC image, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model by combining the concept of fusing the features of first and last convolutional layers, and propagating the input image to the convolutional layer. We also use a dropout layer for preventing the model from overfitting problem. We show the effectiveness of our proposed nucleus segmentation method by evaluating with seven quality metrics and comparing with other methods on four public databases. We achieve average accuracy of 98.61% and more than 97% on each public database. We also evaluate our proposed CNN model by using nine classification metrics and achieve an overall accuracy of 96% on BCCD test database.

Expert systems that prudently analyse facial expression images, utilising an automated machine learning algorithm, can be a promising approach for pain intensity analysis in health domain. Deep neural networks and emerging machine learning techniques have made significant progress in both the feature identification, mapping and the modelling of pain intensity from facial images, with great potential to aid health practitioners in the diagnosis of certain medical conditions. Consequently, there has been significant research within the pain recognition and management area that aim to adopt facial expression datasets into deep learning algorithms to detect the pain intensity in binary classes, and also to identify pain and non-pain faces. However, the volume of research in identifying pain intensity levels in multi-classes remains rather limited. This paper reports on a new enhanced deep neural network framework designed for the effective detection of pain intensity, in four-level thresholds using a facial expression image. To explore the robustness of the proposed algorithms, the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Archive Database, comprised of human facial images, was first balanced, then used for the training and testing of the classification model, coupled with the fine-tuned VGG-Face pre-trainer as a feature extraction tool. To reduce the dimensionality of the classification model input data and extract most relevant features, Principal Component Analysis was applied, improving its computational efficiency. The pre-screened features, used as model inputs, are then transferred to produce a new enhanced joint hybrid CNN-BiLSTM (EJH-CNN-BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm comprised of convolutional neural networks, that were then linked to the joint bidirectional LSTM, for multi-classification of pain. The resulting EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification model, tested to estimate four different levels of pain, revealed a good degree of accuracy in terms of different performance evaluation techniques. The results indicated that the enhanced EJH-CNN-BiLSTM classification algorithm was explored as a potential tool for the detection of pain intensity in multi-classes from facial expression images, and therefore, can be adopted as an artificial intelligence tool in the medical diagnostics for automatic pain detection and subsequent pain management of patients.

Magnetically reactive robots, however, exhibit off-board actuation and consequently demonstrate far greater potential for miniaturization and dexterity.

To demonstrate our learnt approach, we fabricate and actuate candidate tentacles of 2 mm diameter and 42 mm length producing shape profiles within 8% mean absolute percentage error of desired shapes.

In this work we describe a novel technology, low field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), for imaging energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) root morphology and architecture in intact soils. The use of magnetic fields much weaker than those used with traditional MRI experiments reduces the distortion due to magnetic material naturally present in agricultural soils. A laboratory based LF-MRI operating at 47 mT magnetic field strength was evaluated using two sets of soil cores: 1) soil/root cores of Weswood silt loam (Udifluventic Haplustept) and a Belk clay (Entic Hapluderts) from a conventionally tilled field, and 2) soil/root cores from rhizotrons filled with either a Houston Black (Udic Haplusterts) clay or a sandy loam purchased from a turf company. The maximum soil water nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time T-2 (4 ms) and the typical root water relaxation time T-2 (100 ms) are far enough apart to provide a unique contrast mechanism such that the soil water signal has decayed to the point of no longer being detectable during the data collection time period. 2-D MRI projection images were produced of roots with a diameter range of 1.5-2.0 mm using an image acquisition time of 15 min with a pixel resolution of 1.74 mm in four soil types.

RNet outperforms other deep architectures and is able to estimate the volume either directly from the point cloud of a glue deposit or more interestingly after die attachment when only a small part of glue is visible around each die.

In this paper, the effect of hand actions on objects is analyzed for motor-related mental task. The proposed approach analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain activity which was captured for images shown with different gripping actions on objects. The EEG recordings are first pre-processed, followed by extraction of epochs and frequency bands using discrete wavelet transform; afterward, feature extraction followed by training and classification steps is performed for classifying the grip action into congruent (correct) and incongruent (incorrect) grip categories. The proposed work makes use of average power and relative wavelet energy as discriminating features which are then fed to train an artificial neural network for automatically classifying the incoming EEG patterns into correct or incorrect object hand grips. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is done on real EEG dataset obtained from 14 subjects. Experimental results have shown an accuracy of 75%.

However, most of the historical healthcare data sets are overloaded with challenges. One of the most frequently faced challenge is the problem of missing values, occurring because of the inaccuracies in data transmission or data entry processes. An appropriate technique for handling missing values is required to generate good quality data sets for achieving better prediction results. Removing the records with missing values, known as marginalization, poses an easy way out to this challenge. But, this will lessen the data volume of the historical data set and disturb the class balance of the data set. An alternative to marginalization is replacing missing values with plausible values, known as imputation. This paper proposes a missing value imputation technique, CLUSTIMP, using an unsupervised neural network Adaptive Resonance Theory 2 (ART2). The efficiency of the proposed imputation method is evaluated on the incomplete Mammographic mass data set and Hepatocellular Carcinoma data set (HCC) from the UCI repository considering Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) rate and classification accuracy as the evaluation metrics. The proposed CLUSTIMP imputation algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art imputation methods by reducing classifiers error rates between 2 and 11%.","Missing values,Imputation,Unsupervised,Neural network,Classifiers",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,"MISSING,DATA,PREDICTION,VALUES,TREE",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

However, due to the diversity of lung nodules and the visual similarity of lung nodules to their surrounding tissues, it is difficult to construct a robust classification model with conventional deep learning-based diagnostic methods. To address this problem, we propose a multi-model ensemble learning architecture based on 3D convolutional neural network (MMEL-3DCNN). This approach incorporates three key ideas: (1) Constructed multi-model network architecture can be well adapted to the heterogeneity of lung nodules. (2) The input that concatenated of the intensity image corresponding to the nodule mask, the original image, and the enhanced image corresponding to which can help training model to extract advanced feature with more discriminative capacity. (3) Select the corresponding model to different nodule size dynamically for prediction, which can improve the generalization ability of the model effectively. In addition, ensemble learning is applied in this paper to further improve the robustness of the nodule classification model. The proposed method has been experimentally verified on the public dataset, LIDC-IDRI. The experimental results show that the proposed MMEL-3DCNN architecture can obtain satisfactory classification results.","Benign and malignant classification,Computer-aided diagnosis,Image enhancement,Multi-model ensemble architecture,3D CNN",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,PULMONARY,NODULES,CANCER,STATISTICS,ALGORITHMS,NETWORKS,TEXTURE,LEVEL,MODEL",JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649841,

A cohort of 1303 breast cancer screening patients (4935 digital mammogram images in total) was retrospectively analyzed as the target dataset for this study. We assessed six different convolutional neural network model structures utilizing four different imaging datasets (total > 1.4 million images (including ImageNet); medical images different in terms of scale, modality, organ, and source) for pre-training on six classification tasks to assess how the performance of CNN models varies based on training strategy. Representative pre-training strategies included transfer learning with medical and non-medical datasets, layer freezing, varied network structure, and multi-view input for both binary and triple-class classification of mammogram images. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the model performance metric. The best performing model out of all experimental settings was an AlexNet model incrementally pre-trained on ImageNet and a large Breast Density dataset. The AUC for the six classification tasks using this model ranged from 0.68 to 0.77. In the case of distinguishing recalled-benign mammograms from others, four out of five pre-training strategies tested produced significant performance differences from the baseline model. This study suggests that pre-training strategy influences significant performance differences, especially in the case of distinguishing recalled- benign from malignant and benign screening patients.","Breast cancer,Digital mammography,Deep learning,Transfer learning,Training strategy",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"BREAST-CANCER,DIGITAL,MAMMOGRAPHY,RECOMMENDATION,DENSITY,UPDATE",JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573033,

However, this is usually challenging due to low contrast and image artifacts, especially in thyroid ultrasound images where nodules are relatively small in most cases. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a joint-training convolutional neural network (CNN) for thyroid nodule localization in ultrasound images. Considering the advantage of the faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN) in detecting natural targets, we adopt it as the basic framework. To boost the representative power and noise suppression capability of the network, the attention mechanism module is embedded for adaptive feature refinement along the channel and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, in the training process, we annotate the training set in a novel way, called joint-training annotation, by exploiting the fake foreground (FFG) area around the nodule as a spatial prior constraint to improve the sensitivity to small nodules. Ablation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results show that our method outperforms others by a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.93 and achieves an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.9, indicating that the localization results agree well with the ground truth. Furthermore, extended experiments on breast nodule datasets are also conducted to verify the generalizability of the proposed approach. Above all, the proposed algorithm is of considerable significance for accurate thyroid nodule localization in ultrasound images and can be generalized to other types of nodules, thereby providing trustworthy assistance for clinical diagnosis.","Thyroid nodule localization,Ultrasound images,Attention mechanism module,Joint-training annotation,Fake foreground",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,"MANAGEMENT,GUIDELINES,ASSOCIATION,CANCER",JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572967,

Knowledge of the learning process that enables an entrepreneur to re-emerge stronger after a failure, though considerable, is fragmented. This paper systematically collects relevant literature, assigns it to the stages of the experiential learning process (concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, active experimentation; Kolb, 1984), evaluates the research coverage of each stage and identifies promising avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach This systematic literature review follows the guidelines articulated by Short (2009) and Tranfieldet al.(2003), using Web of Science and EBSCO as primary data sources. Kolb's (1984) experiential learning theory provides a basis for organizing the identified material into a framework of entrepreneurial learning from failure. Findings The literature provides insights on all stages of the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure. Particularly well elaborated are the nature of failure and its triggering effect for reflection, the factors influencing reflection, the contents of the resulting learning and their application in entrepreneurial re-emergence. Other topics remain under-researched, including alternative modes of recovery, the impact of personal attributes upon reflection, the cognitive processes underlying reflection, the transformation of failure-based observations into logically sound concepts and the application of this learning in non-entrepreneurial contexts. Originality/value This review provides the most complete overview of research into the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure.

Thirty-seven patients had SpA diagnoses (27 axial SpA and ten peripheral SpA) which was established previously after clinical and laboratory follow-up. To perform the analysis, the SIJ MRI was first segmented and warped. Second, radiomics biomarkers were extracted from the warped MRI images for associative analysis with sacroiliitis and the SpA subtypes. Finally, statistical and machine learning methods were applied to assess the associations of the radiomics texture-based biomarkers with clinical outcomes. Results All diagnostic performances obtained with individual or combined biomarkers reached areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves >= 0.80 regarding SpA related sacroiliitis and and SpA subtypes classification. Radiomics texture-based analysis showed significant differences between the positive and negative SpA groups and differentiated the axial and peripheral subtypes (P < 0.001).

Here, we propose a framework for supervised learning in thin, creased sheets that learn the desired force-response behavior by physically experiencing training examples and then, crucially, respond correctly (generalize) to previously unseen test forces. During training, we fold the sheet using training forces, prompting local crease stiffnesses to change in proportion to their experienced strain. We find that this learning process reshapes nonlinearities inherent in folding a sheet so as to show the correct response for previously unseen test forces. We show the relationship between training error, test error, and sheet size (model complexity) in learning sheets and compare them to counterparts in machine-learning algorithms.

Good correlation between machine learning models and experimental results was obtained. The proposed models can be employed to build a standard mix, and for designing the mix proportions of fly ash based geopolymer concrete. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper discusses the application of big data and its impact on the medical domain. It is noted that the usage of big data models and methods is seamlessly using in the management of exponential data growth in the healthcare domain. Presently, it is complex to visualize how machine learning and big data will have an impact on the medical field. At the same time, there is a significant increment in the number of persons suffers from diabetes mellitus (DM) in various healing centers. This study develops a new map reduce based optimal data classifier (MRODC) technique to diagnose DM efficiently. The presented MRODC model involves different stages of the Hadoop ecosystem, data acquisition, and classification based on gradient boosting tree (GBT). To further improvising the classifier results of the GBT, an improved k-means clustering approach is integrated into it. The traditional K-means clustering involves a random generation of seed value, which greatly affects the cluster's outcome. In improved K-means clustering, a new mechanism is introduced, which sets the seed value based on the minimal clustering error (CE). A detailed experimentation takes place on the benchmark PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset under several aspects. The obtained simulation outcome depicted that the presented MRODC model produces consistently better results over the compared methods with a supreme precision of 99.23, recall of 97.48, accuracy of 97.79, F-score of 98.34, and kappa value of 95.02 .","Big data,Classification,Clustering,Diabetes mellitus,Hadoop,Gradient boosting",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,"HEALTH-CARE,BIG,DATA",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

The proposed method constructs pathological features differing from the other healthy tissues. This method tries to improve the accuracy of pathological images identification and diagnosis. Identification of pathological features from CT images is an essential subject for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, it is difficult to accurately distinguish pathological features owing to the variability of appearances, fuzzy boundaries, heterogeneous densities, shapes and sizes of lesions, etc. Some study results reported that the ResNet network has a better classification and diagnosis performance than other methods, and it has broad application prospectives in the identification of CT images. We use an improved ResNet network as a classification model with our proposed image reconstruction and information fusion methods. First, we evaluate a classification experiment using the hydrocephalus CT image datasets. Through the comparative experiments, we found that gradient features play an important role in the classification of hydrocephalus CT images. The classification effect of CT images with small information entropy is excellent in the evaluation of hydrocephalus CT images. A reconstructed image containing two channels of gradient features and one channel of LBP features is very effective in classification. Second, we apply our proposed method in classification experiments on CT images of colonography polyps for an evaluation. The experimental results have consistency with the hydrocephalus classification evaluation. It shows that the method is universal and suitable for classification of CT images in these two applications for the diagnosis of diseases. The original features of CT images are not ideal characteristics in classification, and the reconstructed image and information fusion methods have a great effect on CT images classification for pathological diagnosis.","Computed tomography images,Image reconstruction,Information fusion,Colonography,Hydrocephalus,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.344,SEGMENTATION,JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,,

In this paper, a system is constructed to improve the sEMG signal measurement environment by producing small multichannel sEMG modules. In addition, deep neural network supervised learning algorithms are implemented to estimate the torque using only the sEMG signal. Based on this, we analyze the organization of algorithms, the processing of the sEMG data, and how the number of channels affects learning. The optimal deep natural network model selected by the analysis is implanted to embedded after learning. The implanted model performs a portable real-time torque optimization (PRTE) according to the sEMG signal entered.

Many samples were prepared by loading MWCNTs and TiO(2)at 50:50 mass% into the ethylene glycol (EG) to measure the thermal conductivity at temperatures within 25-50 degrees C and solid volume fractions of 0-1%. The amount of positive nanoparticles incorporation efficacy on the thermal conductivity was influenced by the volume fraction as well as the temperature. As the temperature augmented from 25 to 50 degrees C, the EG thermal conductivity was intensified by 9.6%, while this figure for nanofluid at 1 vol.% was 18.2%. Therefore, it is concluded that the loading nanoparticles amplified the thermal conductivity sensitivity to temperature.

Conventional (high-field) MRI scanners are very expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, which limit their use in many developing countries. This study is part of a project that aims at addressing these challenges and is carried out by teams from Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the USA. These are working on developing affordable, portable and low-field MRI scanners to diagnose children in developing countries with hydrocephalus. The challenges faced by the teams are that the low-field MRI scanners currently under development are characterized by low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and long scan times. Methods We propose an algorithm called adaptive-size dictionary learning algorithm (AS-DLMRI) that integrates information-theoretic criteria (ITC) and Dictionary learning approaches. The result of the integration is an adaptive-size dictionary that is optimal for any input signal. AS-DLMRI may help to reduce the scan time and improve the SNR of the generated images, thereby improving the image quality. Results We compared our proposed algorithm AS-DLMRI with adaptive patch-based algorithm known as DLMRI and non-adaptive CSMRI technique known as LDP. DLMRI and LDP have been used as the baseline algorithms in other related studies. The results of AS-DLMRI are consistently slightly better in terms of PSNR, SNR and HFEN than for DLMRI, and are significantly better than for LDP. Moreover, AS-DLMRI is faster than DLMRI. Conclusion Using a dictionary size that is appropriate to the input data could reduce the computational complexity, and also the construction quality since only dictionary atoms that are relevant to the task are included in the dictionary and are used during the reconstruction. However, AS-DLMRI did not completely remove noise during the experiments with the noisy phantom. Our next step in our research is to integrate our proposed algorithm with an image denoising function.","Compressed sensing,Dictionary learning,Image reconstruction,Information-theoretic criteria,Low-field MRI",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.683,SPARSE,BMC MEDICAL IMAGING,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3a4cd2b0-a2ab-4533-9611-567071d3336b/datastream/OBJ/download,

Due to the high cost of laboratory-based measurements of rock mechanics properties, the log-based prediction is a viable option. Nowadays, the machine learning tools are being used for estimation of the in situ rock properties using wireline log data. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for rock strength (uniaxial compressive strength) prediction. The main objectives are to investigate the performance of data-driven predictive model in determining this vital parameter and to select features of predictor log variables in the model. The backpropagation multilayer perception (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm as well as the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with coupled simulated annealing (CSA) optimization technique is employed to develop the dynamic data-driven models. Capturing nonlinear, high dimensional, and complex nature of real field log data, the rock strength models' performances are evaluated using statistical criteria to ensure concerning the model reliability and accuracy. The model predictions are compared and validated against the measured values as well as the results obtained from existing log-based correlations. Both the MLP-ANN and the CSA-based LS-SVM connectionist strategies are able to predict the rock strength so that there is a very good match between the model results and corresponding measured values. The input log parameters are ranked based on their contributions in prediction performance. The acoustic travel time and gamma ray are found to have the highest relative significance in estimating rock strength. New correlations are also developed to obtain the in situ rock strength of the siliciclastic sedimentary rocks using the most important log parameters such as dynamic sonic slowness, formation electron density, and shalyness effect. The developed correlations can be used to obtain quick estimation of dynamic uniaxial compressive strength profile using wireline logging data, instead of static data from the surface measurements or laboratory data. It is expected that the proposed models and tools will enable oil and gas engineers to better predict rock strength and thus enhance wellbore performance.","Log variables,Connectionist models,Uniaxial compressive strength,Variable selection,Rock stability",Article,"SPRINGER WIEN, SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA","Engineering,Geology",,7.381,"UNIAXIAL,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,EMPIRICAL,RELATIONS,WAVE,VELOCITIES,NEURAL-NETWORKS,POROSITY,DENSITY,SHEAR,INDEX,ELASTICITY,PARAMETERS",ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING,,

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) promises sensitive and specific diagnosis including rapid point-of-care detection and drug susceptibility testing. SERS utilizes inelastic light scattering arising from the interaction of incident photons with molecular vibrations, enhanced by orders of magnitude with resonant metallic or dielectric nanostructures. While SERS provides a spectral fingerprint of the sample, clinical translation is lagged due to challenges in consistency of spectral enhancement, complexity in spectral interpretation, insufficient specificity and sensitivity, and inefficient workflow from patient sample collection to spectral acquisition. Here, we highlight the recent, complementary advances that address these shortcomings, including (1) design of label-free SERS substrates and data processing algorithms that improve spectral signal and interpretability, essential for broad pathogen screening assays; (2) development of new capture and affinity agents, such as aptamers and polymers, critical for determining the presence or absence of particular pathogens; and (3) microfluidic and bioprinting platforms for efficient clinical sample processing. We also describe the development of low-cost, point-of-care, optical SERS hardware. Our paper focuses on SERS for viral and bacterial detection, in hopes of accelerating infectious disease diagnosis, monitoring, and vaccine development. With advances in SERS substrates, machine learning, and microfluidics and bioprinting, the specificity, sensitivity, and speed of SERS can be readily translated from laboratory bench to patient bedside, accelerating point-of-care diagnosis, personalized medicine, and precision health.","FREE SERS DETECTION,SCATTERING DETECTION,SENSITIVE DETECTION,SINGLE-MOLECULE,GOLD NANOPARTICLES,INVERSE DESIGN,ANTIBODY-FRAGMENTS,INFLUENZA-VIRUSES,CELL-SEPARATION,H7N9 VIRUS",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"FREE,SERS,DETECTION,SCATTERING,DETECTION,SENSITIVE,DETECTION,SINGLE-MOLECULE,GOLD,NANOPARTICLES,INVERSE,DESIGN,ANTIBODY-FRAGMENTS,INFLUENZA-VIRUSES,CELL-SEPARATION,H7N9,VIRUS",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5142767,

Previous studies profiling the sensory properties and aroma profiles of apple varieties have provided a lexicon describing important attributes within the modalities of aroma, texture, and flavour. The range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by four apple cultivars was assessed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). To facilitate automated dynamic headspace extraction of the VOCs from bulk samples, a small multichamber thermal extraction system was used. Forty compounds were detected and putatively identified by mass spectral comparison with NIST libraries. Eight compounds were not previously identified in apples. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) done on the whole volatile organic compound profiles show separation of the four cultivars. The use of random forest classification enabled the determination of a minimum set of fifteen potential VOC markers that successfully differentiate the cultivars under study. Trends across samples, VOCs, and sensory evaluation are revealed. The association between 4-hexen-1-ol acetate with texture/consistency, and crispiness, and correlation of 2-methylbut-2-en-1-yl acetate with juiciness and acidity is shown for the first time.

Materials and methods Data about 47 patients with pathological OPSCC (15 HPV positive and 32 HPV negative) were collected from a public database. Using 2D and 3D manual segmentations, 1032 texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced CT images. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. Collinearity analysis and a wrapper-based subset search algorithm were used for feature selection. Models were created usingk-nearest neighbors (k-NN), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) alone and with a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Classifier performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results Compared with 2D segmentation (468 of 1032, 45.3%), 3D segmentation (576 of 1032, 55.8%) yielded more texture features with reliable reproducibility (good to excellent in both intraobserver and interobserver analyses) (p < 0.001). RF andk-NN classifiers failed to achieve better classification performance using 3D features than using 2D features either alone or with SMOTE. The best models for 2D and 3D segmentations were both created using RF, which alone achieved areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.880 and 0.847, respectively, and with SMOTE, AUCs of 0.953 and 0.920, respectively, were achieved. Conclusions Three-dimensional segmentation had better CT texture feature reproducibility, but 2D segmentation showed better performance. Considering the cost, 2D segmentation is more recommended for ML-based classification of HPV status of OPSCC.","Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck,Human papilloma virus,Multidetector computed tomography,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"NECK,HEAD,VARIABILITY,RELIABILITY,FEATURES",EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY,,

Using the high specific capacity and low polarization of 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate dilithium as a basis for improvement, 26 iMOFs from different combinations of aqueous terephthalic, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic, and 4,4 '-biphenyl dicarboxylic-based solutions with Li source are synthesized to obtain a material with the optimal electrochemical performances. For a more comprehensive search of the optimal ratio of raw material solutions, a machine learning-based prediction model is constructed, using a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the experimentally derived characteristics of the 26 iMOFs. With this model, the optimal iMOF ratio is found to be a 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid-rich ternary solution of raw material. It is concluded that the improvement in the electrochemical properties originates from a change in the iMOFs crystal structure caused by synthesis from three solutions. As the model is independent of fabrication parameters such as heating temperature, it can also be used for evaluation of synthesis procedures.

We employed three different ML models to predict the 'k(P)' for Ti alloys. Among the regression models, the gradient boosting regressor yields the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.92 for k P.

Despite their early promise, high interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneities make any rational design and analysis of these theranostics platforms extremely problematic. Recent advances in deep-learning-based tools may help bridge this gap, using pattern recognition algorithms for better diagnostic precision and therapeutic outcome. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a conundrum because of the complex molecular diversity, making its diagnosis and therapy challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a method to predict the cellular internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) against different cancer stages using artificial intelligence. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a combination of machine-learning (ML) algorithm and characteristic cellular uptake responses for individual cancer cell types can be successfully used to classify various cancer cell types. Utilizing this approach, we can optimize the nanomaterials to get an optimum structure-internalization response for a given particle. This methodology predicted the structure-internalization response of the evaluated nanoparticles with remarkable accuracy (Q(2) = 0.9). We anticipate that it can reduce the effort by minimizing the number of nanoparticles that need to be tested and could be utilized as a screening tool for designing nanotherapeutics. Following this, we have proposed a diagnostic nanomaterial-based platform used to assemble a patient-specific cancer profile with the assistance of machine learning (ML). The platform is composed of eight carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) with multifarious surface chemistries that can differentiate healthy breast cells from cancerous cells and then subclassify TNBC cells vs non-TNBC cells, within the TNBC group. The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm has been successfully used in identifying the type of cancer cells from 36 unknown cancer samples with an overall accuracy of >98%, providing potential applications in cancer diagnostics.","carbon nanoparticles,breast cancer,cellular uptake,pattern recognition,cancer diagnosis,artificial neural network,biosensor",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,8.162,"CARBON,NANOPARTICLES,REORGANIZATION,ENDOCYTOSIS,DELIVERY,RELEASE,TARGET,DOT",ACS SENSORS,,

Materials and Methods HSD were acquired using a hyperspectral imager, which is a type of spectrometer that can simultaneously capture information about wavelength and position. GoogLeNet pre-trained with Imagenet was used to model the convolutional neural network. As many CNNs (including GoogLeNet) have three input channels, the HSD (involving 84 channels) could not be input directly. For that reason, a ""Mini Network"" layer was added to reduce the number of channels from 84 to 3 just before the GoogLeNet input layer.

A CAD system has been developed to differentiate malignant thyroid nodules from benign thyroid nodules in ultrasound images based on deep learning methods. The diagnostic performance was compared between the CAD system and the experienced attending radiologists. Methods The ultrasound image dataset for training the CAD system included 651 malignant nodules and 386 benign nodules while the database for testing included 422 malignant nodules and 128 benign nodules. All the nodules were confirmed by pathology results. In the proposed CAD system, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification and fused features which combined the deep features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the hand-crafted features such as the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), local binary patterns (LBP), and scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) were obtained. The optimal feature subset was formed by selecting these fused features based on the maximum class separation distance and used as the training sample for the SVM. Results The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the CAD system were 92.5%, 96.4%, and 83.1%, respectively, which were higher than those of the experienced attending radiologists.

Current treatment options for PD are symptomatic and typically involve the replacement of DA neurotransmission by DA drugs, which relieve the patients of some of their motor symptoms. However, by the time of diagnosis, patients have already lost about 70% of their substantia nigra DA neurons and these drugs offer only temporary relief. Therefore, cell replacement therapy has garnered much interest as a potential treatment option for PD. Early studies using human fetal tissue for transplantation in PD patients provided proof of principle for cell replacement therapy, but they also highlighted the ethical and practical difficulties associated with using human fetal tissue as a cell source. In recent years, advancements in stem cell research have made human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) an attractive source of material for cell replacement therapy. Studies on how DA neurons are specified and differentiated in the developing mouse midbrain have allowed us to recapitulate many of the positional and temporal cues needed to generate DA neuronsin vitro. However, little is known about the developmental programs that govern human DA neuron development. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics, it has become possible to analyze precious human samples with unprecedented detail and extract valuable high-quality information from large data sets. This technology has allowed the systematic classification of cell types present in the human developing midbrain along with their gene expression patterns. By studying human development in such an unbiased manner, we can begin to elucidate human DA neuron development and determine how much it differs from our knowledge of the rodent brain. Importantly, this molecular description of the function of human cells has become and will increasingly be a reference to define, evaluate, and engineer cell types for PD cell replacement therapy and disease modeling.","dopaminergic neuron,stem cell,progenitor,radial glia,single cell,machine learning,cell replacement,Parkinson's disease",Review,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Cell Biology,Developmental Biology",,7.219,"VENTRAL,TEGMENTAL,AREA,GLIAL,GLUTAMATE,TRANSPORTERS,PARKINSONS-DISEASE,SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA,TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE,FLOOR,PLATE,HUMAN,ES,DIFFERENTIAL,EXPRESSION,CLINICAL,TRANSLATION,TARGETED,DISRUPTION",FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357704,

The predicted Delta G(H*) values show a high-level accuracy via the random forest algorithm by using only simple elemental features. A total of 299 MXene materials were screened by DFT calculations and four ML models (Elman Artificial Neural Networks, kernel ridge regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression algorithms). Using the simple elemental information, the random forest algorithm shows a high-level predicted accuracy with a low testing root-mean-square error of 0.27 eV. Os2B- and S-terminated Scn+1Nn (n = 1, 2, 3) were discovered to be the active catalysts as Delta G(H*) approaches zero with wide hydrogen coverages (theta from 1/9 to 4/9). S functional groups play a crucial role in regulating the HER performance due to the antibonding states which are full of electrons. Consequently, it weakens the adsorption of H* which is the key step of HER. In summary, the present work suggests that ML models are competitive tools in accelerating the screening of efficient HER catalysts.","MACHINE,ADSORPTION,PERFORMANCE,NANOSHEETS,GRAPHENE,ELECTROCATALYSTS,DESCRIPTOR,PREDICTION,NANOTUBES,1T-MOS2",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"MACHINE,ADSORPTION,PERFORMANCE,NANOSHEETS,GRAPHENE,ELECTROCATALYSTS,DESCRIPTOR,PREDICTION,NANOTUBES,1T-MOS2",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

We herein report dataset augmentation, benchmarking, and interrogation for an ongoing experimental campaign consisting of 9483 halide perovskite synthesis experiments. To address limitations in previous work, we developed an improved description of the reactant concentrations in the experiments (validated against experimental observations) and performed experiments quantifying the excess volume of mixing of gamma-butyrolactone/formic acid mixtures used in the perovskite syntheses. Combining this improved description of reactant concentration with other physicochemical features of the reactants, we constructed 1108 ML models to elucidate the roles of the algorithm (k-nearest neighbors, linear support-vector machine, and gradient boosted tree), feature set (12 in total), preprocessing regime (e.g., standardization), and training data holdout scheme on ML predictive ability. ML comparisons illustrated that the chemical accuracy of less sophisticated physical models in a dataset do not hinder interpolative model performance. Analysis of feature contributions showed how ML models ""learn"" competitive representations for concentration using raw experimental descriptions. Interrogation of the most performant models indicated that the numerical values of physicochemical features were not important, rather these features were being used to identify and interpolate within a particular reactant set. ML models were shown to be capable of making rudimentary extrapolations to untrained chemical systems when compared against basic benchmarks, and models which included the newly developed chemical features were shown to be more reliable than models trained without. These results illustrate how a stepwise comparative approach to machine learning can provide insight into what and how much models are ""learning"" for a given prediction task.","IODIDE PEROVSKITE,CRYSTALLIZATION,TRANSPORT,WILL",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"IODIDE,PEROVSKITE,CRYSTALLIZATION,TRANSPORT,WILL",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

Data-driven structural health monitoring faces the challenge of data insufficiency that renders the learned model limited in identifying damage scenarios that are not contained in the training data. Model-based methods are susceptible to modeling error due to model idealizations and simplifications that make the finite element model updating results deviate from the truth. This study attempts to combine the merits of data-driven and physics-based structural health monitoring methods via physics-guided machine learning, expecting that the damage identification performance can be improved. Physics-guided machine learning uses observed feature data with correct labels as well as the physical model output of unlabeled instances. In this study, physics-guided machine learning is realized with a physics-guided neural network. The original modal-property based features are extended with the damage identification result of finite element model updating. A physics-based loss function is designed to evaluate the discrepancy between the neural network model output and that of finite element model updating. With the guidance from the scientific knowledge contained in finite element model updating, the learned neural network model has the potential to improve the generality and scientific consistency of the damage detection results. The proposed methodology is validated by a numerical case study on a steel pedestrian bridge model and an experimental study on a three-story building model.","Structural health monitoring,damage detection,pattern recognition,model updating,data insufficiency,modeling error,physics-guided learning",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,5.861,OUTPUT,STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

This paper presented a marker-free surgical instrument tracking framework based on object extraction via deep learning (DL). Methods The surgical instrument joint was defined as the tracking point. Using DL, a segmentation model was trained to extract the end-effector and shaft portions of the surgical instrument in real time. The extracted object was transformed into a distance image by Euclidean Distance Transformation. Next, the points with the maximal pixel value in the two portions were defined as their central points, respectively, and the intersection point of the line connecting the two central points and the plane connecting the two portions was determined as the tracking point. Finally, the object could be fast extracted using the masking method, and the tracking point was fast located frame-by-frame in a laparoscopic video to achieve tracking of surgical instrument. The proposed object extraction via a DL-based marker-free tracking framework was compared with a marker-free tracking-by-detection framework via DL. Results Using seven in vivo laparoscopic videos for experiments, the mean tracking success rate was 100%. The mean tracking accuracy was (3.9 +/- 2.4, 4.0 +/- 2.5) pixels measured inuandvcoordinates of a frame, and the mean tracking speed was 15 fps. Compared to the reported mean tracking accuracy of a marker-free tracking-by-detection framework via DL, the mean tracking accuracy of our proposed tracking framework was improved by 37% and 23%, respectively. Conclusion Accurate and fast tracking of marker-free surgical instruments could be achieved in in vivo laparoscopic videos by using our proposed object extraction via DL-based marker-free tracking framework. This work provided important guiding significance for the application of laparoscope-holder robots in laparoscopic surgeries.","Laparoscopic surgery,Surgical instrument joint,Surgical instruments tracking,Deep learning,Laparoscope-holder robot",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"SURGERY,SEGMENTATION,CAMERAMAN",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Therefore, the classification process is increasingly dependent on artificial intelligence. The traditional image classification method needs to extract a large number of features. Redundant features cause the recognition speed to be slow, and influence the recognition effect. To address these problems and obtain the highest recognition accuracy with the least number of features, this paper proposes a machine learning method based on feature selection algorithm for cervical cell classification. Firstly, we introduced classification and regression trees (CART) for cell feature selection, which reduces the dimension of input feature attributes. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to optimize the hyperparameters of support vector machine (SVM) in this paper, making the SVM model better for classification. Finally, the Herlev dataset was introduced to verify the classification performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract accurate and effective features and obtain high classification accuracy, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the network structure of the proposed algorithm is relatively simple with a low computation cost, which makes it feasible of further extension to the classification application of other cancer cells.","Feature extraction,CART feature selection,PSO-SVM,Cervical cell classification",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,"DECISION,TREE,CANCER,SEGMENTATION,SYSTEM",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

94,Review on remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine and deep learning,32,7,,"Mohan Amrita,Singh Amit Kumar,Kumar Basant,Dwivedi Ramji","Mohan A,Singh AK,Kumar B,Dwivedi R",Mohan A,10.1002/ett.3998,National Institute of Technology (NIT System),"Landslide, one of the most critical natural hazards, is caused due to specific compositional slope movement. In the past decades, due to inflation of urbanized area and climate change, a compelling expansion in landslide prevalence took place which is also termed as mass/slope movement and mass wasting, causing extensive collapse around the world. The principal reason for its pursuance is a reduction in the internal resistance of soil and rocks, classified as a slide, topple, fall, and flow. Slopes can be differentiated based on earth material and the nature of its movements. The downward flow of landslides occurs due to excessive rainfall, snowmelt, earthquake, volcanic eruption, and so on. This review article revisits the conventional approaches for identification of landslides, predicting future risk, associated with slope failures, followed by emphasizing the advantages of modern geospatial techniques such as aerial photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing images (ie, panchromatic, multispectral, radar images), Terrestrial laser scanning, and High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HR-DEM) in updating landslide inventory maps. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, Artificial neural network, deep learning has been extensively used with geographical data producing effective results for assessment of natural hazard/resources and environmental research. Based on recent studies, deep learning is a reliable tool addressing remote sensing challenges such as trade-off in imaging system producing poor quality investigation, in addition, to expedite consequent task such as image recognition, object detection, classification, and so on. Conventional methods, like pixel and object-based machine learning methods, have been broadly explored. Advanced development in deep learning technique like CNN (Convolutional neural network) has been extensively successful in information extraction from an image and has exceeded other traditional approaches. Over the past few years, minor attempts have been made for landslide susceptibility mapping using CNN. In addition, small sample sizes for training purpose will be major drawback and notably remarkable while using deep learning techniques. Also, assessment of the model's performance with diverse training and testing proportion other than commonly utilized ratio, that is, 70/30 needs to be explored further.

Radiomics-based models have recently been introduced to overcome these issues, but limitations in demonstrating their generalizability on independent datasets are slowing their introduction to clinic. The aim of this study is to evaluate two radiomics-based models to classify malignant pulmonary nodules in low-dose CT screening, and to externally validate them on an independent cohort. The effect of a radiomics features harmonization technique is also investigated to evaluate its impact on the classification of lung nodules from a multicenter data. Methods Pulmonary nodules from two independent cohorts were considered in this study; the first cohort (110 subjects, 113 nodules) was used to train prediction models, and the second cohort (72 nodules) to externally validate them. Literature-based radiomics features were extracted and, after feature selection, used as predictive variables in models for malignancy identification. An in-house prediction model based on artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented and evaluated, along with an alternative model from the literature, based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier coupled with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). External validation was performed on the second cohort to evaluate models' generalization ability. Additionally, the impact of the Combat harmonization method was investigated to compensate for multicenter datasets variabilities. A new training of the models based on harmonized features was performed on the first cohort, then tested separately on the harmonized and non-harmonized features of the second cohort. Results Preliminary results showed a good accuracy of the investigated models in distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules with both sets of radiomics features (i.e., non-harmonized and harmonized). The performance of the models, quantified in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC), was > 0.89 in the training set and > 0.82 in the external validation set for all the investigated scenarios, outperforming the clinical standard (AUC of 0.76). Slightly higher performance was observed for the SVM-LASSO model than the ANN in the external dataset, although they did not result significantly different. For both harmonized and non-harmonized features, no statistical difference was found between Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves related to training and test set for both models. Conclusions Although no significant improvements were observed when applying the Combat harmonization method, both in-house and literature-based models were able to classify lung nodules with good generalization to an independent dataset, thus showing their potential as tools for clinical decision-making in lung cancer screening.","low-dose CT screening,lung nodules classification,radiomics",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"FEATURES,PERFORMANCE,NODULES",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7708421,

These artifacts may cover the tissues around the metal implants in CT images and even corrupt the tissue regions, thus affecting disease diagnosis using these images. Previous deep learning metal trace inpainting methods used both valid pixels of uncorrupted areas and invalid pixels of corrupted areas to patch metal trace (i.e., the holes of removed metal-corrupted regions). Such methods cannot recover fine details well and often suffer information mismatch due to interference of invalid pixels, thus incurring considerable secondary artifacts. In this paper, we develop a new irregular metal trace inpainting network for reducing metal artifacts. Methods We develop a new deep learning network to patch irregular metal trace in metal-corrupted sinograms to reduce metal artifacts for isometric fan-beam CT. Our new method patches irregular metal trace in CT sinograms using only valid pixels, avoiding interference from invalid pixels. Furthermore, to enable the inpainting network to recover as many details as possible, we design an auxiliary inpainting network to suppress the probable secondary artifacts in CT images to assist fine detail restoration. The image produced by the auxiliary network is then projected onto a sinogram via a forward projection (FP) algorithm and is fused with the sinogram predicted by the inpainting network in order to predict the final recovered sinogram. Our entire network is trained end-to-end to extract cross-domain information between the sinogram domain and CT image domain. Results We compare our proposed method with two traditional and four deep learning-based metal trace inpainting methods, and with an iterative reconstruction method on four datasets: dental fillings (panoramic and local perspectives), hip prostheses, and spine fixations. We use both quantitative and qualitative indices to evaluate our method, and the analyses suggest that our method reduces the most metal artifacts and produces the best quality CT images. Additionally, our proposed method takes 0.1512 s on average to process a CT slice, which meets the clinical requirement. Conclusions This paper proposes a new deep learning network to patch irregular metal trace in corrupted sinograms to reduce metal artifacts. Our method restores more fine details in irregular metal trace and has a superior capability on metal artifact reduction compared with state-of-the-art methods.","deeep learning,dual domain,partial network,sinogram inpainting,metal artifact reduction",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"STATISTICAL,ITERATIVE,RECONSTRUCTION,TECHNIQUE,SART,ABDOMINAL,CT,PROJECTION,ART",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1002/mp.14295,
