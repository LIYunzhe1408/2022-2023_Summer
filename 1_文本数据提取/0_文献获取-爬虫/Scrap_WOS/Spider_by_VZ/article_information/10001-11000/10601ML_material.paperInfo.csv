It is necessary for the treatment of initial stages in AD so that the further degeneration could be delayed. This diagnosis can be achieved with the application of machine learning techniques which employ various optimization and probabilistic techniques. Hence with an objective of distinguishing people with normal brain ageing from those who would develop Alzheimer's disease, this paper presents an effective machine learning model that successfully diagnosed AD, cMCI, ncMCI and CN which are being detected during pre-stages by itself.","FEATURE REPRESENTATION,CLASSIFICATION",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,1.826,"FEATURE,REPRESENTATION,CLASSIFICATION",MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS,,

The digital images acquired from large-scale civil infrastructures for crack detection using unmanned robots often suffer from motion blur and lack of pixel resolution, which may degrade the corresponding crack detectability. The proposed SrcNet is able to significantly enhance the crack detectability by augmenting the pixel resolution of the raw digital image through deep learning. SrcNet basically consists of two phases: phase I-deep learning-based super resolution (SR) image generation and phase II-deep learning-based automated crack detection. Once the raw digital images are obtained from a target bridge surface, phase I of SrcNet generates the corresponding SR images to the raw digital images. Then, phase II automatically detects cracks from the generated SR images, making it possible to remarkably improve the crack detectability. SrcNet is experimentally validated using the digital images obtained using a climbing robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle from in situ concrete bridges located in South Korea. The validation test results reveal that the proposed SrcNet shows 24% better crack detectability compared to the crack detection results using the raw digital images.","SrcNet,super resolution,digital image,automated crack detection,deep learning,in situ bridge test,climbing robot,unmanned aerial vehicle",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,5.861,"IMAGE,SUPERRESOLUTION,DAMAGE,DETECTION",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

4,A Model Developed for Predicting Uniformity of Kyphoplasty Balloon Wall Thickness Based on the Orthogonal Test,2020,,,"Dai Guanghui,Zhang Qingqing,Jin Guobao","Dai GH,Zhang QQ,Jin GB",Dai GH,10.1155/2020/1643080,Chaohu University,"In order to optimize the wall thickness distribution of medical balloon, kyphoplasty balloon was chosen as the research object, the uniformity of wall thickness distribution was taken as the evaluation index, and the influence of stretch blow molding process on the uniformity of kyphoplasty balloon was investigated. In this paper, 16 sets of orthogonal test schemes were studied by selecting four main parameters such as forming temperature, forming pressure, stretching distance, and holding time of stretch blow molding process based on the L-16(4(4)) Taguchi method orthogonal table. The statistical analysis showed that the forming temperature was an utmost parameter on the uniformity, while an optimal scheme was obtained and an optimal balloon with the uniformity of 95.86% was formed under the scheme. To further quantify the relationship between the uniformity and the parameters, artificial neural network (ANN) and nonlinear regression (NLR) models were developed to predict the uniformity of the balloon based on orthogonal test results. A feed-forward neural network based on backpropagation (BP) was made up of 4 input neurons, 11 hidden neurons, and one output neuron, an objective function of the NLR model was developed using second-order polynomial, and the BFGS method was used to solve the function. Adequacy of models was tested using hypothesis tests, and their performances were evaluated using the R-2 value. Results show that both predictive models can be used for predicting the uniformity of the balloon with a higher reliability. However, the NLR model showed a slightly better performance than the ANN model.","SURFACE-ROUGHNESS,OPTIMIZATION,REGRESSION,PRESSURE",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,,"SURFACE-ROUGHNESS,OPTIMIZATION,REGRESSION,PRESSURE",ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2020/1643080.pdf,

Although dialysis patients are at a high risk of death, it is difficult for medical practitioners to simultaneously evaluate many inter-related risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of hemodialysis patients using machine learning model, and its usefulness for screening hemodialysis patients at a high risk of one-year death using the nation-wide database of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.
Materials and methods
The patients were separated into two datasets (n = 39,930, 39,930, respectively). We categorized hemodialysis patients in Japan into new clusters generated by the K-means clustering method using the development dataset. The association between a cluster and the risk of death was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Then, we developed an ensemble model composed of the clusters and support vector machine models in the model development phase, and compared the accuracy of the prediction of mortality between the machine learning models in the model validation phase.
Results
Average age of the subjects was 65.7 +/- 12.2 years; 32.7% had diabetes mellitus. The five clusters clearly distinguished the groups on the basis of their characteristics: Cluster 1, young male, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 2, female, and chronic glomerulonephritis; Cluster 3, diabetes mellitus; Cluster 4, elderly and nephrosclerosis; Cluster 5, elderly and protein energy wasting. These clusters were associated with the risk of death; Cluster 5 compared with Cluster 1, hazard ratio 8.86 (95% Cl 7.68, 10.21). The accuracy of the ensemble model for the prediction of 1-year death was 0.948 and higher than those of logistic regression model (0.938), support vector machine model (0.937), and deep learning model (0.936).
Conclusions
The clusters clearly categorized patient on their characteristics, and reflected their prognosis. Our real-world-data-based machine learning system is applicable to identifying high-risk hemodialysis patients in clinical settings, and has a strong potential to guide treatments and improve their prognosis.","MORTALITY,OUTCOMES",Article,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE, 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,3.788,"MORTALITY,OUTCOMES",PLOS ONE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7259704,

This study aims to predict the mechanical properties such as equivalent tensile strength and micro-hardness of friction-stir-welded dissimilar aluminium alloy plates AA 6063-O and AA 2014-T6, using artificial neural network (ANN).
Design/methodology/approach
The ANN model used for the experiment was developed through back propagation algorithm. The input parameter of the model consisted of tool rotational speed and weld-traverse speed whereas the output of the model consisted of mechanical properties (tensile strength and hardness) of the joint formed by friction-stir welding (FSW) process. The ANN was trained for 60% of the experimental data. In addition, the impact of the process parameters (tool rotational speed and weld-traverse speed) on the mechanical properties of the joint was determined by Taguchi Grey relational analysis.
Findings
Subsequently, testing and validation of the ANN were done using experimental data, which were not used for training the network. From the experiment, it was inferred that the outcomes of the ANN are in good agreement with the experimental data. The result of the analyses showed that the tool rotational speed has more impact than the weld-traverse speed.
Originality/value
The developed neural network can be used to predict the mechanical properties of the weld. Results indicate that the network prediction is similar to the experiment results. Overall regression value computed for training, validation and testing is greater than 0.9900 for both tensile strength and microhardness. In addition, the percentage error between experimental and predicted values was found to be minimal for the mechanical properties of the weldments. Therefore, it can be concluded that ANN is a potential tool for predicting the mechanical properties of the weld formed by FSW process. Similarly, the results of Taguchi Grey relational analysis can be used to optimize the process parameters of the weld process and it can be applied extensively to ascertain the most prominent factor. The results of which indicates that rotational speed of 1,270 rpm and traverse speed of 30 mm/min are to be the optimized process parameters. The result also shows that tool rotational speed has more impact on the mechanical properties of the weld than that of traverse speed.","Grey relational analysis,Artificial neural network (ANN),Dissimilar aluminium alloys,Friction-stir welding (FSW)",Article,"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD, HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,"GREY,RELATIONAL,ANALYSIS,MULTIRESPONSE,OPTIMIZATION,WELDING,PARAMETERS,NEURAL-NETWORK",WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING,,

Although successful, the computational cost required is still the main hurdle even today. In recent years, there has been a trend of combining DFT with Machine Learning (ML) to reduce the computational cost without compromising accuracy. Finding the right set of descriptors that are simple to understand in terms of giving insights about the problem at hand, lies at the heart of any ML problem. In this work, we demonstrate the use of nearest neighbor (NN) distances as descriptors to predict the interaction energy between the cluster and an adsorbate. The model is trained over a size range of 5 to 75 atom clusters. When the training and testing is carried out on mutually exclusive cluster sizes, the mean absolute error (MAE) in predicting the interaction energy is similar to 0.24 eV. MAE reduces to 0.1 eV when testing and training sets include information from the complete range. Furthermore, when the same set of descriptors are tested over individual sizes, the MAE further reduces to similar to 0.05 eV. We bring out the correlation between dispersion in the nearest neighbor distances and variation in MAE for individual sizes. Our detailed and extensive DFT calculations provide a rationale as to why nearest neighbor distances work so well. Finally, we also demonstrate the transferability of the ML model by applying the same recipe of descriptors to systems of different elements like (Na-10), bimetallic systems (Al6Ga6, Li4Sn6, and Au40Cu40) and also different adsorbates (N-2, O-2, and CO).","WATER CLUSTERS,SIZE,REACTIVITY,GOLD,POTENTIALS,ADSORPTION,METALS,ATOMS,SITE",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",Chemistry,,,"WATER,CLUSTERS,SIZE,REACTIVITY,GOLD,POTENTIALS,ADSORPTION,METALS,ATOMS,SITE",NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY,,

The experimental design was done using the Box-Behnken Design method. In the RSM model, the quadratic model was shown to predict the closest results in comparison to our experimental data. For ANN approach, a two-layer Feed-Forward Back-Propagation Neural Network model was designed. The results showed that sewage sludge supplementation increased the efficiency of theSinapis albaplant in removing Cd from the soil. After 28 days of exposure, the removal rate varied from 10.96% without any supplementation to 65.9% after supplementation with the highest possible (law allowed) dose of sewage sludge. The comparison proved that the prediction capability of the ANN model was much higher than that of the RSM model (adjustedR-square: 0.98, standard error of the Cd prediction removal: 0.85 +/- 0.02). Thus, the ANN model could be used for the prediction of heavy metal removal during assisted phytoremediation with sewage sludge.

Structural health indicators interpret the structural health condition of the underlying dynamical system. Long-term structural health monitoring on in-service civil engineering infrastructures has demonstrated that commonly used structural health indicators, such as modal frequencies, depend on the ambient conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to detrend the ambient effects on the structural health indicators for reliable judgment on the variation of structural integrity. However, two major challenging problems are encountered. First, it is not trivial to formulate an appropriate parametric expression for the complicated relationship between the operating conditions and the structural health indicators. Second, since continuous data stream is generated during long-term structural health monitoring, it is required to handle the growing data efficiently. The proposed propagative broad learning provides an effective tool to address these problems. In particular, it is a model-free data-driven machine learning approach for nonparametric modeling of the ambient-influenced structural health indicators. Moreover, the learning network can be updated and reconfigured incrementally to adapt newly available data as well as network architecture modifications. The proposed approach is applied to develop the ambient-influenced structural health indicator model based on the measurements of 3-year full-scale continuous monitoring on a reinforced concrete building.","Structural health monitoring,propagative broad learning,nonparametric modeling,modal frequencies,ambient conditions",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,5.861,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,MONITORING-SYSTEM,DAMAGE,DETECTION,CANTON,TOWER,SELECTION,IDENTIFICATION,LOADS",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

In the present work, three-hundred and sixty data samples on four mechanical properties of steels-fatigue strength, tensile strength, fracture strength and hardness-were selected from the Japan National Institute of Material Science database, comprising data on carbon steels and low-alloy steels. Five machine learning algorithms were used to predict the mechanical properties of the materials represented by the three-hundred and sixty data samples, and random forest regression showed the best predictive performance. Feature selection conducted by random forest and symbolic regressions revealed the four most important features that most influence the mechanical properties of steels: the tempering temperature of steel, and the alloying elements of carbon, chromium and molybdenum. Mathematical expressions were generated via symbolic regression, and the expressions explicitly predicted how each of the four mechanical properties varied quantitatively with the four most important features.

Therefore, we aimed to develop an immune-relevant-gene-based signature to predict LUAD patients' prognosis and to characterize their tumor microenvironment thus guiding therapeutic strategy.
Methods and Materials: Gene expression data of LUAD patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were systematically analyzed. We performed Cox regression and random survival forest algorithm to identify immune-relevant genes with potential prognostic value. A risk score formula was then established by integrating these selected genes and patients were classified into high- and low-risk score group. Differentially expressed genes, infiltration level of immune cells, and several immune-associated molecules were further compared across the two groups.
Results: Nine hundred and fifty-four LUAD patients were enrolled in this study. After implementing the 2-steps machine learning screening methods, 12 immune-relevant genes were finally selected into the risk-score formula and the patients in high-risk group had significantly worse overall survival (HR = 10.6, 95%CI = 3.21-34.95, P < 0.001). We also found the distinct immune infiltration patterns in the two groups that several immune cells like cytotoxic cells and immune checkpoint molecules were significantly enriched and upregulated in patients from the high-risk group. These findings were further validated in two independent LUAD cohorts.
Conclusion: Our risk score formula could serve as a powerful and accurate tool for predicting survival of LUAD patients and may facilitate clinicians to choose the optimal therapeutic regimen more precisely.","lung adenocarcinoma,risk score formula,immune infiltration,machine learning,survival",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Oncology,,6.264,"TGF-BETA,PD-1,BLOCKADE,CANCER,EXPRESSION,SURVIVAL,PATHWAY,PREDICTION,SELECTION,PACKAGE,MODEL",FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7267039,

The convolutional neural network is currently considered as the state-of-the-art method for structural damage identification due to its capabilities of efficient and robust feature learning in a hierarchical manner. It is a tendency to develop a convolutional neural network with a deeper architecture to gain a better performance. However, when the depth of the network increases to a certain level, the performance will degrade due to the gradient vanishing issue. Residual neural networks can avoid the problem of vanishing gradients by utilizing skip connections, which allows the information flowing to the next layer through identity mappings. In this article, a deep residual network framework is proposed for structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures. This framework is composed of purely residual blocks which operate as feature extractors and a fully connected layer as a regressor. It learns the damage-related features from the vibration characteristics such as mode shapes and maps them into the damage index labels, for example, stiffness reductions of structures. To evaluate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed framework, an intensive evaluation is conducted with both numerical and experimental studies. The comparison between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-art models, including a sparse autoencoder neural network, a shallow convolutional neural network and a convolutional neural network with the same structure but without skip connections, is conducted. In the numerical studies, a 7-storey steel frame is investigated. Four scenarios with considering measurement noise and finite element modelling errors in the data sets are studied. The proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all the scenarios, especially for the most challenging scenario, which includes both measurement noise and uncertainties. Experimental studies on a prestressed concrete bridge in the laboratory are conducted. The proposed framework demonstrates consistent damage prediction results on this beam with the state-of-the-art models.","Residual networks,deep learning,structural health monitoring,damage identification,uncertainties,measurement noise",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,5.861,"DAMAGE,IDENTIFICATION,NEURAL-NETWORK",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

Here, we demonstrate an accurate diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer, using deep learning-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of the exosomes. Our approach was to explore the features of cell exosomes through deep learning and figure out the similarity in human plasma exosomes, without learning insufficient human data. The deep learning model was trained with SERS signals of exosomes derived from normal and lung cancer cell lines and could classify them with an accuracy of 95%. In 43 patients, including stage I and II cancer patients, the deep learning model predicted that plasma exosomes of 90.7% patients had higher similarity to lung cancer cell exosomes than the average of the healthy controls. Such similarity was proportional to the progression of cancer. Notably, the model predicted lung cancer with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.912 for the whole cohort and stage I patients with an AUC of 0.910.

However, the SEB x-ray images are not directly correlated to the dose images. In addition, limited spatial resolution of the x-ray camera and low-count situation may impede correctly estimating the beam range and width in SEB x-ray images. To overcome these limitations of the SEB x-ray images measured by the x-ray camera, a deep learning (DL) approach was proposed in this work to predict the dose images for estimating the range and width of the carbon ion beam on the measured SEB x-ray images.
Methods To prepare enough data for the DL training efficiently, 10,000 simulated SEB x-ray and dose image pairs were generated by our in-house developed model function for different carbon ion beam energies and doses. The proposed DL neural network consists of two U-nets for SEB x ray to dose image conversion and super resolution. After the network being trained with these simulated x-ray and dose image pairs, the dose images were predicted from simulated and measured SEB x-ray testing images for performance evaluation.
Results For the 500 simulated testing images, the average mean squared error (MSE) was 2.5 x 10(-5) and average structural similarity index (SSIM) was 0.997 while the error of both beam range and width was within 1 mm FWHM. For the three measured SEB x-ray images, the MSE was no worse than 5.5 x 10(-3) and SSIM was no worse than 0.980 while the error of the beam range and width was 2 mm and 5 mm FWHM, respectively.
Conclusions We have demonstrated the advantages of predicting dose images from not only simulated data but also measured data using our deep learning approach.","carbon ion,deep learning,dose,range,secondary electron bremsstrahlung x ray,simulation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY,PROMPT,GAMMA-RAYS,PROTON,CAMERA,BEAMS,DELIVERY,RADIOTHERAPY,TRANSPORT",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

The 1/b-value has almost the same trend with acoustic emission signal cumulative energy, which can meet the preliminarily needs of health monitoring. The particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm works by using nine characteristic parameters of acoustic emission signals. It demonstrates that the characteristic parameters of acoustic emission signals are closely related to the failure mode of the carbon fiber reinforced polymer cable. This indicates their correspondence to the cable's damage degree and their ability to work as training data for machine learning. With particle swarm optimization, the trained support vector machine can reach at least 77% accuracy of a single acoustic emission signal when predicting the corresponding current damage degree. In addition, using the voting mechanism can promote the performance of support vector machine.

Post-bomb strike bodies are handled by emergency and forensic teams. We aimed to determine whether medical dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) algorithm and prediction model can readily detect and distinguish a range of explosives on the human body during disaster victim identification (DVI) processes of bombings. Materials and Methods A medical DECT of 8 explosives (Semtex, Pastex, Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, Acetone peroxide, Nitrocellulose, Pentrite, Ammonium Nitrate, and classified explosive) was conducted ex-vivo and on an anthropomorphic phantom. Hounsfield unit (HU), electron density (ED), effective atomic number (Z(eff)), and dual energy index (DEI),were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Intra-class (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were computed. Explosives classification was performed through a prediction model with test-retest samples. Results Except for DEI (p = 0.036), means of HU, ED, and Z(eff) were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between explosives ex-vivo and on the phantom (r > 0.80). Intra- and inter-reader ICC were good to excellent: 0.806 to 0.997 and 0.890, respectively. Except for the phantom DEI, all measurements from each individual explosive differed significantly. HU, ED, Z(eff), and DEI differed depending on the type of explosive. Our decision tree provided Z(eff) and ED for explosives classification with high accuracy (83.7%) and excellent reliability (100%).

In this paper, we investigate the effect of different levels of realism on the training of deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of robotic instruments. An interactive virtual-reality environment was developed to generate synthetic images for robot-aided endoscopic surgery. In contrast with earlier works, we use physically based rendering for increased realism.
Methods Using a virtual reality simulator that replicates our robotic setup, three synthetic image databases with an increasing level of realism were generated: flat, basic, and realistic (using the physically-based rendering). Each of those databases was used to train 20 instances of a UNet-based semantic-segmentation deep-learning model. The networks trained with only synthetic images were evaluated on the segmentation of 160 endoscopic images of a phantom. The networks were compared using the Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner nonparametric test.
Results Our results show that the levels of realism increased the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of the networks on endoscopic images of a phantom (p < 0.01). The median mIoU values were 0.235 for the flat dataset, 0.458 for the basic, and 0.729 for the realistic. All the networks trained with synthetic images outperformed naive classifiers. Moreover, in an ablation study, we show that the mIoU of physically based rendering is superior to texture mapping (p < 0.01) of the instrument (0.606), the background (0.685), and the background and instruments combined (0.672).
Conclusions Using physical-based rendering to generate synthetic images is an effective approach to improve the training of neural networks for the semantic segmentation of surgical instruments in endoscopic images. Our results show that this strategy can be an essential step in the broad applicability of deep neural networks in semantic segmentation tasks and help bridge the domain gap in machine learning.","Deep learning,Semantic segmentation,Photorealistic rendering",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

In this paper, we propose a robust and accurate technique for the automatic detection of mitoses from histological breast cancer slides using the multi-task deep learning framework for object detection and instance segmentation Mask RCNN. Our mitosis detection and instance segmentation framework is deployed for two main tasks: it is used as a detection network to perform mitosis localization and classification in the fully annotated mitosis datasets (i.e., the pixel-level annotated datasets), and it is used as a segmentation network to estimate the mitosis mask labels for the weakly annotated mitosis datasets (i.e., the datasets with centroid-pixel labels only). We evaluate our approach on the fully annotated 2012 ICPR grand challenge dataset and the weakly annotated 2014 ICPR MITOS-ATYPIA challenge dataset. Our evaluation experiments show that we can obtain the highest F-score of 0.863 on the 2012 ICPR dataset by applying the mitosis detection and instance segmentation model trained on the pixel-level labels provided by this dataset. For the weakly annotated 2014 ICPR dataset, we first employ the mitosis detection and instance segmentation model trained on the fully annotated 2012 ICPR dataset to segment the centroid-pixel annotated mitosis ground truths, and produce the mitosis mask and bounding box labels. These estimated labels are then used to train another mitosis detection and instance segmentation model for mitosis detection on the 2014 ICPR dataset. By adopting this two-stage framework, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art mitosis detection approaches on the 2014 ICPR dataset by achieving an F-score of 0.475. Moreover, we show that the proposed framework can also perform unsupervised mitosis detection through the estimation of pseudo labels for an unlabeled dataset and it can achieve promising detection results.

CDR can be measured from fundus images through the segmentation of optic disc and optic cup . Deep convolutional networks have been proposed to achieve biomedical image segmentation with less time and more accuracy, but requires large amounts of annotated training data on a target domain, which is often unavailable. Unsupervised domain adaptation framework alleviates this problem through leveraging off-the-shelf labeled data from its relevant source domains, which is realized by learning domain invariant features and improving the generalization capabilities of the segmentation model. Methods In this paper, we propose a WGAN domain adaptation framework for detecting optic disc-and-cup boundary in fundus images.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality with a high spatial and temporal resolution that has been used for intraoperative imaging and also for motion estimation, for example, in the context of ophthalmic surgery or cochleostomy. Recently, motion estimation between a template and a moving OCT image has been studied with deep learning methods to overcome the shortcomings of conventional, feature-based methods. Methods We investigate whether using a temporal stream of OCT image volumes can improve deep learning-based motion estimation performance. For this purpose, we design and evaluate several 3D and 4D deep learning methods and we propose a new deep learning approach. Also, we propose a temporal regularization strategy at the model output. Results Using a tissue dataset without additional markers, our deep learning methods using 4D data outperform previous approaches. The best performing 4D architecture achieves an correlation coefficient (aCC) of 98.58% compared to 85.0% of a previous 3D deep learning method. Also, our temporal regularization strategy at the output further improves 4D model performance to an aCC of 99.06%. In particular, our 4D method works well for larger motion and is robust toward image rotations and motion distortions. Conclusions We propose 4D spatio-temporal deep learning for OCT-based motion estimation.

Initially, 36 delay risk factors were identified from previous literature, and subsequently developed into surveys to determine the likelihood and consequence of the risk factors. Forty-eight useable responses obtained from subject matter experts were used to develop a dataset suitable for machine learning application. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble methods were considered. Feature subset selection revealed that the most relevant independent variables include ""slowness in decision making""; ""delay in sub-contractors work""; ""architects'/structural engineers' late issuance of instruction""; and ""waiting for approval of shop drawings and material samples"". The final results showed that the best model for predicting the risk of delay was based on ANN with a classification accuracy of 93.75%.

Application to liquid water shows that training the network with a relatively small number of molecular configurations is sufficient to predict the polarizability of arbitrary liquid configurations in close agreement with ab initio density functional theory calculations. In combination with a neural network representation of the interatomic potential energy surface, the scheme allows us to calculate the Raman spectra along 2-nanosecond classical trajectories at different temperatures for H2O and D2O. The vast gains in efficiency provided by the machine learning approach enable longer trajectories and larger system sizes relative to ab initio methods, reducing the statistical error and improving the resolution of the low-frequency Raman spectra.

In this report, we illustrate that Bayesian optimization (BO), a sample-efficient machine learning algorithm, can calibrate different density functional models, e.g., hybrid exchange-correlation and range-separated density functionals. Using the atomization energies and bond lengths from the Gaussian-1 (G1) and Gaussian-2 (G2) databases, we show that BO optimizes the free parameters of the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals with approximately SS evaluations of the error function. We also show that selecting exchange-correlation functionals for different physical systems can be done with BO.

We propose, in this paper, an efficient and fully automatic deep multi-scale three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) architecture for glioma brain tumor classification into low-grade gliomas (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG) using the whole volumetric T1-Gado MRI sequence. Based on a 3D convolutional layer and a deep network, via small kernels, the proposed architecture has the potential to merge both the local and global contextual information with reduced weights. To overcome the data heterogeneity, we proposed a preprocessing technique based on intensity normalization and adaptive contrast enhancement of MRI data. Furthermore, for an effective training of such a deep 3D network, we used a data augmentation technique. The paper studied the impact of the proposed preprocessing and data augmentation on classification accuracy. Quantitative evaluations, over the well-known benchmark (Brats-2018), attest that the proposed architecture generates the most discriminative feature map to distinguish between LG and HG gliomas compared with 2D CNN variant. The proposed approach offers promising results outperforming the recently supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art approaches by achieving an overall accuracy of 96.49% using the validation dataset. The obtained experimental results confirm that adequate MRI's preprocessing and data augmentation could lead to an accurate classification when exploiting CNN-based approaches.","Classification,3D convolutional neural network (CNN),Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),Gliomas,Classification,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,,JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522155,

Furthermore, with the availability of different clinical technologies, tumor features have been collected for breast cancer classification. Therefore, feature selection and accuracy improvement have become a challenging and time-consuming task. In this paper, the proposed approach has two stages. In the first, Association Rules (AR) are used to eliminate insignificant features. In the second, several classifiers are applied to differentiate the incoming tumors. Feature space dimension is reduced from nine to eight and four attributes by using AR. In test stage, threefold cross-validation method was applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository to evaluate the proposed system performances. The correct classification rate obtained with Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with AR shows the highest classification accuracy (98.00%) for eight attributes and 96.14% for 4 attributes.

In this study, we develop an automated deep learning method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to identify the FGT region in MRI volumes and evaluate its impact on a specific clinical application. The GAN consists of an improved U-Net as a generator to generate FGT candidate areas and a patch deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) as a discriminator to evaluate the authenticity of the synthetic FGT region. The proposed method has two improvements compared to the classical U-Net: (1) the improved U-Net is designed to extract more features of the FGT region for a more accurate description of the FGT region; (2) a patch DCNN is designed for discriminating the authenticity of the FGT region generated by the improved U-Net, which makes the segmentation result more stable and accurate. A dataset of 100 three-dimensional (3D) bilateral breast MRI scans from 100 patients (aged 22-78 years) was used in this study with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 3D hand-segmented FGT areas for all breasts were provided as a reference standard. Five-fold cross-validation was used in training and testing of the models. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard index (JI) values were evaluated to measure the segmentation accuracy. The previous method using classical U-Net was used as a baseline in this study. In the five partitions of the cross-validation set, the GAN achieved DSC and JI values of 87.0 +/- 7.0% and 77.6 +/- 10.1%, respectively, while the corresponding values obtained through by the baseline method were 81.1 +/- 8.7% and 69.0 +/- 11.3%, respectively. The proposed method is significantly superior to the previous method using U-Net. The FGT segmentation impacted the BPE quantification application in the following manner: the correlation coefficients between the quantified BPE value and BI-RADS BPE categories provided by the radiologist were 0.46 +/- 0.15 (best: 0.63) based on GAN segmented FGT areas, while the corresponding correlation coefficients were 0.41 +/- 0.16 (best: 0.60) based on baseline U-Net segmented FGT areas. BPE can be quantified better using the FGT areas segmented by the proposed GAN model than using the FGT areas segmented by the baseline U-Net.","breast MRI,fibroglandular tissue segmentation,baseline parenchymal enhancement quantification,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,ASSOCIATION,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,,

A DCNN has millions of free parameters that need to be trained, but the training sample set is limited in size for most medical imaging tasks so that transfer learning is typically used. Automatic data mining may be an efficient way to enlarge the collected data set but the data can be noisy such as incorrect labels or even a wrong type of image. In this work we studied the generalization error of DCNN with transfer learning in medical imaging for the task of classifying malignant and benign masses on mammograms. With a finite available data set, we simulated a training set containing corrupted data or noisy labels. The balance between learning and memorization of the DCNN was manipulated by varying the proportion of corrupted data in the training set. The generalization error of DCNN was analyzed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the training and test sets and the weight changes after transfer learning. The study demonstrates that the transfer learning strategy of DCNN for such tasks needs to be designed properly, taking into consideration the constraints of the available training set having limited size and quality for the classification task at hand, to minimize memorization and improve generalizability.","deep convolutional neural network,breast cancer,mammography,generalization error,artificial intelligence",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,CLASSIFICATION,PERFORMANCE,LESIONS,TISSUE,MASS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981191,

Current techniques lack in accuracy and/or line-of-sight constraints (conventional tracking systems) or expose the patient to prohibitive ionizing radiation (intra-operative CT). A possible solution is to capture the instrument with a c-arm at irregular intervals and recover the pose from the image. Methods i3PosNet infers the position and orientation of instruments from images using a pose estimation network. Said framework considers localized patches and outputs pseudo-landmarks. The pose is reconstructed from pseudo-landmarks by geometric considerations. Results We show i3PosNet reaches errors <0.05 mm. It outperforms conventional image registration-based approaches reducing average and maximum errors by at least two thirds. i3PosNet trained on synthetic images generalizes to real X-rays without any further adaptation. Conclusion The translation of deep learning-based methods to surgical applications is difficult, because large representative datasets for training and testing are not available.

We posit that concepts from machine learning can help to tackle this long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of this strategy through developing a structure-mechanics statistical learning scheme to elucidate how local rigidity in double-stranded (ds)DNA and dsRNA may lead to their global flexibility in bend, stretch, and twist. Specifically, the mechanical parameters in a heavy-atom elastic network model are computed from the trajectory data of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. The results show that the inter-atomic springs for backbone and ribose puckering in dsRNA are stronger than those in dsDNA, but are similar in strengths for base-stacking and base-pairing. Our analysis shows that the experimental observation of dsDNA being easier to bend but harder to stretch than dsRNA comes mostly from the respective B- and A-form topologies. The computationally resolved composition of local rigidity indicates that the flexibility of both nucleic acids is mostly due to base-stacking. But for properties like twist-stretch coupling, backbone springs are shown to play a major role instead. The quantitative connection between local rigidity and global flexibility sets foundation for understanding how local binding and chemical modification of genetic materials effectuate longer-ranged regulatory signals.","MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS,DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA,RELATIVE FLEXIBILITY,B-DNA,FORCE-FIELD,RNA,TWIST,PROTEINS,BINDING,ELASTICITY",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",Chemistry,,9.658,"MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,SIMULATIONS,DOUBLE-STRANDED,DNA,RELATIVE,FLEXIBILITY,B-DNA,FORCE-FIELD,RNA,TWIST,PROTEINS,BINDING,ELASTICITY",CHEMICAL SCIENCE,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2020/sc/d0sc00480d,

On the background of a unifying hypothesis for cognitive decline, we merged knowledge from dementia and epilepsy research in order to identify biomarkers with a high predictive value for cognitive decline across and beyond these groups that can be fed into intelligent systems. We prospectively assessed patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (N = 9), mild cognitive impairment (N = 19), and subjective cognitive complaints (N = 4) and healthy controls (N = 18). All had structural cerebral MRI, EEG at rest and during declarative verbal memory performance, and a neuropsychological assessment which was repeated after 18 months. Cognitive decline was defined as significant change on neuropsychological subscales. We extracted volumetric and shape features from MRI and brain network measures from EEG and fed these features alongside a baseline testing in neuropsychology into a machine learning framework with feature subset selection and 5-fold cross validation. Out of 50 patients, 27 had a decline over time in executive functions, 23 in visual-verbal memory, 23 in divided attention, and 7 patients had an increase in depression scores. The best sensitivity/specificity for decline was 72%/82% for executive functions based on a feature combination from MRI volumetry and EEG partial coherence during recall of memories; 95%/74% for visual-verbal memory by combination of MRI-wavelet features and neuropsychology; 84%/76% for divided attention by combination of MRI-wavelet features and neuropsychology; and 81%/90% for increase of depression by combination of EEG partial directed coherence factor at rest and neuropsychology.

Computer-aided methods are used to assist medical doctors to make early diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study is to build an effective prediction model for breast cancer diagnosis based on anthropometric data and parameters collected through routine blood analysis. The proposed approach innovatively exploits principal component analysis (PCA) technique cascaded by median filtering so as to transform original features into a form of containing less distractive noise not to cause overfitting. Since a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model is adopted to classify patterns of the transformed features, the computational load imposed in the training of artificial neural network model is kept minimized thanks to the non-iterative nature of GRNN training. The proposed method has been devised and tested on the recent Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) that contains 9 clinical features measured for each of 116 subjects. Outperforming all of the existing studies on BCCD, our method achieved a mean accuracy rate of 0.9773. Experimental results evidence that this study achieves the best prediction performance ever reported on this dataset. The fact that our proposed approach has accomplished such a boosted performance of breast cancer diagnosis based on routine blood analysis features offers a great potential to be used in a widespread manner to detect the disease in its inception phase.

The use of predictive models for the properties of the concretes can save in time and energy and provide information on scheduling the activities such as framework removal. In this study, M5P algorithm was used to model the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural strength, and splitting tensile strength of these concretes. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset containing information on the mixture proportions and the values of the mechanical properties at different ages was collected from internationally published documents. The dataset was divided into two subsets of training data and testing data. Several performance metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the developed models. The results indicated that the proposed models can provide reliable predictions of the target mechanical properties. A more comprehensive dataset can further improve the performance of the models.

This kind of medical imaging modalities is capable of providing detailed and significant information of lumen contour shape, which is very important for clinical diagnosis and analysis of cardiovascular diseases.

In this work, a supervised machine learning method for coronary artery lumen segmentation with high accuracy and minimal user interaction is designed. The fully discriminative lumen segmentation method jointly learning a classifier the weak learners rely on and the features of the classifier is developed. Additionally, the theoretical supports of the Gradient Boosting framework used in this work and its quadratic approximation are presented.

The optimal structure with the largest TMR ratio was obtained by Bayesian optimization with 1728 structural candidates, where the convergence was reached within 300 structure calculations. Characterization of the obtained structures suggested that the in-plane distance between two Al atoms plays an important role in determining the TMR ratio. Since the Al-Al distance of disordered MAO significantly affects the imaginary part of complex band structures, the majority-spin conductance of the Delta(1) state in Fe/disordered-MAO/Fe MTJs increases with increasing in-plane Al-Al distance, leading to larger TMR ratios. Furthermore, we found that the TMR ratio tended to be large when the ratio of the number of Al, Mg, and vacancies in the [001] plane was 2:1:1, indicating that the control of Al atomic positions is essential to enhancing the TMR ratio in MTJs with disordered MAO.

Most of the conventional machine learning methods involved a gene filtering step, in which tens of thousands of genes were firstly filtered based on the gene expression levels by a statistical method with an arbitrary cutoff. Although gene filtering procedure helps to reduce the feature dimension and avoid overfitting, there is a risk that some pathogenic genes important to the disease will be ignored. Results In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning approach by combining a convolutional neural network with stationary wavelet transform (SWT-CNN) for stratifying cancer patients and predicting their clinical outcomes without gene filtering based on tumor genomic profiles. The proposed SWT-CNN overperformed the state-of-art algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR), and produced comparable prediction performance to random forest (RF). Furthermore, for all the cancer types, we firstly proposed a method to weight the genes with the scores, which took advantage of the representative features in the hidden layer of convolutional neural network, and then selected the prognostic genes for the Cox proportional-hazards regression. The results showed that risk stratifications can be effectively improved by using the identified prognostic genes as feature, indicating that the representative features generated by SWT-CNN can well correlate the genes with prognostic risk in cancers and be helpful for selecting the prognostic gene signatures. Conclusions Our results indicated that gene expression-based SWT-CNN model can be an excellent tool for stratifying the prognostic risk for cancer patients. In addition, the representative features of SWT-CNN were validated to be useful for evaluating the importance of the genes in the risk stratification and can be further used to identify the prognostic gene signatures.","Convolutional neural network,Stationary wavelet transform,Cancer prognosis prediction,RNA-sequencing,Cox regression",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"GASTRIC-CANCER,SURVIVAL,PREDICTION,SERIAL,ANALYSIS,EXPRESSION,CLASSIFICATION,SELECTION,MACHINE,IDENTIFICATION,METASTASIS,BIOMARKERS",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-020-03544-z,

The mechanical characterization of a model crystal may be cast as an inverse problem of deducing the defect population characteristics (density, correlations) in small volumes from the mechanical behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a deep residual network can be used to deduce the dislocation characteristics of a sample of interest using only its surface strain profiles at small deformations, and then statistically predict the mechanical response of size-affected samples at larger deformations. As a testbed of our approach, we utilize high-throughput discrete dislocation simulations for systems of widths that range from nano- to micro- meters. We show that the proposed deep learning model significantly outperforms a traditional machine learning model, as well as accurately produces statistical predictions of the size effects in samples of various widths.

However, due to various US imaging artifacts, manual operation of the transducer during acquisition, and different machine settings, many existing methods cannot deal with the large variations of the bone surface responses, in the collected data, without manual parameter selection. Even for fully automatic methods, such as deep learningbased methods, the problem of dataset bias causes networks to perform poorly on the US data that are different from the training set. Methods In this work, an intensity-invariant convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed for robust segmentation of bone surfaces from US data obtained from two different US machines with varying acquisition settings. The proposed CNN takes US image as input and simultaneously generates two intermediate output images, denoted as local phase tensor (LPT) and global context tensor (GCT), from two branches which are invariant to intensity variations. LPT and GCT are fused to generate the final segmentation map. In the training process, the LPT network branch is supervised by precalculated ground truth without manual annotation. Results The proposed method is evaluated on 1227 in vivo US scans collected using two US machines, including a portable handheld ultrasound scanner, by scanning various bone surfaces from 28 volunteers. Validation of proposed method on both US machines not only shows statistically significant improvements in cross-machine segmentation of bone surfaces compared to state-of-the-art methods but also achieves a computation time of 30 milliseconds per image, 98.5% improvement over state-of-the-art. Conclusion The encouraging results obtained in this initial study suggest that the proposed method is promising enough for further evaluation. Future work will include extensive validation of the method on new US data collected from various machines using different acquisition settings. We will also evaluate the potential of using the segmented bone surfaces as an input to a point set-based registration method.","Ultrasound,Orthopedics,Surgery,Bone,Segmentation,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

An exception to this trend is the growing use of mRNA-based methods in early-stage breast cancer. Although DNA and mRNA are used together in breast cancer research, the distinct contribution of mRNA beyond that of DNA in clinical challenges has not yet been directly assessed. We hypothesize that mRNA harbors prognostically useful information independently of genomic variation. To validate this, we use both genomic mutations and gene expression to predict five-year breast cancer recurrence in an integrated test model. This is accomplished first by comparing the feature importance of DNA and mRNA features in a model trained on both, and second, by evaluating the difference in performance of models trained on DNA and mRNA data separately. Results We find that models trained on DNA and mRNA data give more weight to mRNA features than to DNA features, and models trained only on mRNA outperform models trained on DNA alone. Conclusions The evaluation process presented here may serve as a framework for the interpretation of the relative contribution of individual molecular markers. It also suggests that mRNA has a distinct contribution in a diagnostic setting, beyond and independently of DNA mutation data.","Gene expression,Genomics,Breast cancer recurrence,Oncology,Machine learning,Data science",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"CANCER,DECISIONS,MEDICINE,ASSAY",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-020-3512-z,

The electronic nose (e-nose) was proposed in the 1980s to tackle the selectivity issue, but it required top-down chemical functionalization processes to deposit multiple functional materials. Here, we report a novel gas-sensing scheme using a single graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) and machine learning to realize gas selectivity under particular conditions by combining the unique properties of the GFET and e-nose concept. Instead of using multiple functional materials, the gas-sensing conductivity profiles of a GFET are recorded and decoupled into four distinctive physical properties and projected onto a feature space as 4D output vectors and classified to differentiated target gases by using machine-learning analyses. Our single-GFET approach coupled with trained pattern recognition algorithms was able to classify water, methanol, and ethanol vapors with high accuracy quantitatively when they were tested individually. Furthermore, the gas-sensing patterns of methanol were qualitatively distinguished from those of water vapor in a binary mixture condition, suggesting that the proposed scheme is capable of differentiating a gas from the realistic scenario of an ambient environment with background humidity. As such, this work offers a new class of gas-sensing schemes using a single GFET without multiple functional materials toward miniaturized e-noses. Sensors: Graphene and machine learning sniff out gasesA sensor combined with machine learning algorithms makes an effective 'electronic nose' to distinguish different gases, according to research from the United States. The new approach, developed by a team led by Takeshi Hayasaka of the University of California, Berkeley, combines selectivity, low cost, and low power consumption without needing different materials to sense different gases. A graphene field effect transistor is used as a sensor, and four parameters of its conductivity profile are used as inputs to a machine learning classifier. With enough data, the classifier could identify water, methanol, and ethanol vapors. The researchers also showed that it could distinguish water and methanol in a mixture. These findings are an important step towards a miniaturized e-nose, which would be useful in areas such as environmental and safety monitoring, petrochemical processing, and other industries.","SENSOR ARRAYS,DISCRIMINATION,HUMIDITY,TEMPERATURE,RESPONSES,FLAVOR",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Instruments & Instrumentation",,6.955,"SENSOR,ARRAYS,DISCRIMINATION,HUMIDITY,TEMPERATURE,RESPONSES,FLAVOR",MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4b5685bn/qt4b5685bn.pdf?t=r0fw2l,

Models for predicting POEs were trained using data from 1406 patients and 59 variables; the best model had an AUC-ROC of 0.875 (95% CI 0.834, 0.913) and a PR-AUC 0.706 (95% CI, 0.610, 0.790).
Conclusions The performance of the ML models in the present study was encouraging. Further validation in a multi-institutional clinical setting with larger datasets would be necessary to establish their clinical value. ML models can be used to predict significant events during and after surgery with good accuracy, paving the way for application in clinical practice to predict and intervene at an opportune time to avert complications and improve patient outcomes.","deep learning,intra-operative complications,machine learning,postoperative complications,postoperative morbidity,robot-assisted partial nephrectomy",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Urology & Nephrology,,,"LENGTH-OF-STAY,TUMOR,SCORING,SYSTEMS,PERIOPERATIVE,COMPLICATIONS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,RACIAL,DISPARITIES,HOSPITAL,VOLUME,IMPACT",BJU INTERNATIONAL,http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/275763/1/10.1111-bju.15087.pdf,

Different sectors have continuously evolved in this area. In the crushing industry, plants function under strict conditions, many of which involve grinding materials. Therefore, various factors are responsible for how the crushers perform. This research investigated the ability of the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to simulate the effects of throw, eccentric speed, closed side setting, and the size of the particle on crusher output. The developed simulation model was adjusted and authenticated alongside the experimental data of the investigated parameters. The model's performance was computed by the use of several prediction criteria skills. The results of the study indicated that the developed ANFIS model could simulate the Cone crusher output and give a dependable forecast of the cumulative weight fraction. The researchers resolved that the model fostered was a suitable instrument for the onsite cone crusher assessment.","cone crushers,data-driven modeling,forecasting,production,simulation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Computer Science,,2.016,OPTIMIZATION,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,,

The design process for such smart materials requires iterations of finite-element simulations that are computationally expensive. Recently, researchers have tried replacing numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) models to predict the output at a much higher speed. However, there exist very few studies that explore the model algorithm's expressive capacity and analyze the physical interpretation based on the problem. This paper focuses on using ML to predict the nonlinear deformation behavior of digital materials. Various problem construction approaches and model performance are compared and discussed. It is shown that clustering the materials helps improve the generalization of training and models that treat material features as an array of numbers still face difficulties to provide accurate predictions. Inspired by modern computer vision technologies, convolutional kernels outperform other methods by recognizing the material distribution patterns. The performance is further enhanced after reconstructing the regression problem into classification. Moreover, high-level material design information can be extracted from the model through a sensitivity analysis. This framework may greatly improve the response prediction and design process for 4D-printed smart materials.","convolutional neural networks,deep learning,digital materials,finite elements,machine learning",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,4.004,,ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS,,

They have an anisotropic behaviour, which hinders the analysis of structural impairment caused by damages like impacts. Optical lock-in thermography (OLT) can be used to assess CFRP integrity and image processing tools can be applied to measure the area affected by impacts on the thermal images. There are several alternatives for segmenting those images and this work proposes a transfer learning approach with a U-Net neural network used in characterisations of neuronal structures in microscopy for segmenting OLT images of CFRP plates with impact damages. After training and testing this tool with OLT images, using as ground truth their manual segmentation, the results were compared with four image processing combinations of methods: a filter based on two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform with an adaptive threshold tool; an absolute thermal contrast (ATC) with a global threshold (GT) tool; the image overflow difference with GT; and principal component analysis (PCA) with GT. The results show that the U-Net was the most reliable for the proposed conditions for defective area assessment, allowing a higher safety in maintenance tasks.","Lock-in thermography,non-destructive testing,image segmentation,convolutional neural networks,transfer learning",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,2.052,SEGMENTATION,NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION,,

In a material data set in the stress-strain space, the data points are considered to lie on or near a low-dimensional manifold, rather distribute ubiquitously in the space. This paper presents a kernel method for extracting this manifold. We formulate a regularized least-squares problem for learning a manifold, and show that its optimal solution corresponds to an eigenvector of a real symmetric matrix. Therefore, the method requires only simple computational task, and is easy to implement. We also give a description how to use the obtained solution in static equilibrium analysis of an elastic structure. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional continua are performed to demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","Regularized least squares,Kernel method,Manifold learning,Data-driven computing,Model-free computational mechanics",Article,"SPRINGER JAPAN KK, SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",Mathematics,,0.884,"NONLINEAR,DIMENSIONALITY,REDUCTION,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,WYPIWYG,HYPERELASTICITY,MODEL,HOMOGENIZATION,DERIVATION,EIGENMAPS",JAPAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS,,

Firstly, a Siamese network with two identical convolutional neural network (CNN) sub-networks and a logistic regression for leukocyte five classification is designed, which can learn not only distinguishing features but also a similarity metric. Then for each category of the leukocytes, a typical sample is selected by the hematologist. To train the Siamese network, a leukocyte and a typical sample that belong to the same category make up a genuine pair and the leukocyte with the rest four typical samples respectively make up four impostor pairs. Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy.

However, the prognostic relevance of their spatial interactions remains unknown. Here, by applying automated image analysis and machine learning approaches, we evaluate the prognostic significance of these cellular subpopulations and their spatial interactions. Resultant data, from a training cohort retrospectively collated from Edinburgh, UK hospitals (n = 113), were used to create a combinatorial prognostic model, which identified a subpopulation of patients who exhibit 100% survival over a 5-year follow-up period. The combinatorial model integrated lymphocytic infiltration, the number of lymphocytes within 50-mu m proximity to TBs, and the CD68(+)/CD163(+) macrophage ratio. This finding was confirmed on an independent validation cohort, which included patients treated in Japan and Scotland (n = 117). This work shows that by analyzing multiple cellular subpopulations from the complex TME, it is possible to identify patients for whom surgical resection alone may be curative.","EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION,INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES,CANCER,MACROPHAGES,CELLS,PHENOTYPE,FRONT",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,11.665,"EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL,TRANSITION,INFILTRATING,LYMPHOCYTES,CANCER,MACROPHAGES,CELLS,PHENOTYPE,FRONT",NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/19977/1/Nearchou_2020_npjDM_Spatialimmune_CC.pdf,

Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of image segmentation play an important role in image-guided surgery. Traditional machine learning methods have achieved certain beneficial effects in medical image segmentation, but they have problems such as low classification accuracy and poor robustness. Deep learning theory has good generalizability and feature extraction ability, which provides a new idea for solving medical image segmentation problems. However, deep learning has problems in terms of its application to medical image segmentation: one is that the deep learning network structure cannot be constructed according to medical image characteristics; the other is that the generalizability y of the deep learning model is weak. To address these issues, this paper first adapts a neural network to medical image features by adding cross-layer connections to a traditional convolutional neural network. In addition, an optimized convolutional neural network model is established. The optimized convolutional neural network model can segment medical images using the features of two scales simultaneously. At the same time, to solve the generalizability problem of the deep learning model, an adaptive distribution function is designed according to the position of the hidden layer, and then the activation probability of each layer of neurons is set. This enhances the generalizability of the dropout model, and an adaptive dropout model is proposed. This model better addresses the problem of the weak generalizability of deep learning models. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical image segmentation algorithm based on an optimized convolutional neural network with adaptive dropout depth calculation. An ultrasonic tomographic image and lumbar CT medical image were separately segmented by the method of this paper. The experimental results show that not only are the segmentation effects of the proposed method improved compared with those of the traditional machine learning and other deep learning methods but also the method has a high adaptive segmentation ability for various medical images.
