A dataset including more than ten thousand melting temperature data has been established, which covers 8 elements and most of the known non-oxide UHTCs. We built up an element to ceramic system framework by back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) with the accuracy approaching to 90% and the correlation coefficients approaching to 0.95. Our work provides a probability to get the high accuracy melting temperature of UHTCs, and a more convenient way to develop novel materials with higher working temperature. The given case of melting temperature prediction of Hf-C-N ceramics proves the generality of the artificial neural network (ANN). An inter-validation of melting temperature prediction using our network with materials thermodynamics and density functional theory (DFT) has been demonstrated, indicating that our network is of powerful prediction ability.","Ultra-high temperature ceramics,Machine learning,Melting temperature prediction",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,4.049,"DEPENDENT,FRACTURE,STRENGTH,RESISTANCE,OXIDATION,ALLOYS,MODEL",CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL,,

In this paper, according to the orthogonal design of experiments, the numerical simulation analysis of the springback for the 3D stretch-bending aluminum profile is carried out by the ABAQUS finite element software. And to investigate the effect of material properties on the springback, the range analysis of the orthogonal experiment is performed. The results show that these material properties of the aluminum profile (elastic modulus E, yield strength sigma(y), and tangent modulus E-1) might have the biggest influence on the springback of the aluminum profile, and the optimized forming parameters are founded as follows: the horizontal bending degree is 14 degrees, the vertical bending degree is 14 degrees, the number of multipoint stretch-bending dies is 10, the friction coefficient is 0.15, and aluminum alloy grade is 6063. Moreover, the model of the BP neural network for the prediction of the springback is established and trained based on the orthogonal experiment, and the results with the BP neural network model are in good agreement with experimental results. So it is obvious that the BP neural network could predict effectively the springback of 3D multipoint stretch-bending parts.","FINITE-ELEMENT,ALUMINUM-ALLOY,PREDICTION,BEHAVIOR",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,1.94,"FINITE-ELEMENT,ALUMINUM-ALLOY,PREDICTION,BEHAVIOR",ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2019/6465196.pdf,

While VARMs postulate that a given region of interest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that directed dependencies arise clue to instantaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are not necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary perspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that leverage both instantaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put forth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they are incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series. To this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably broaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels, which have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in canonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here to the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient regularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to real-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected dictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach. Numerical tests on ECoG data captured through a study on epileptic seizures demonstrate that it is possible to unveil previously unknown directed links between brain regions of interest.","Network topology inference,structural vector autoregressive models,nonlinear models",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.239,"GRANGER,CAUSALITY,CORTICAL,INTERACTIONS,EQUATION,MODELS,CONNECTIVITY,TOPOLOGY,FMRI",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6779157,

This paper proposes a multi-scale hybrid degradation index that combines the degradation of membranes and electrodes to estimate the aging state of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Firstly, different degradation models are utilized to estimate the degradation indexes such as average radius of Pt particles, electrochemical surface area, and membrane thickness. A multi-sale hybrid degradation index is then designed to fuse all the previous indexes based on the quantified effects of electrode and membrane degradation. Finally, based on the automatic machine learning algorithm and the aging experimental data of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, the proposed hybrid degradation index is verified.

PML is well suited for applications where a wireless tracking is crucial, and in particular for tongue motion which opens up many new interesting applications. To allow its usage outside of a research lab, our tongue tracking system relies on the PML to avoid impeding tongue's natural motion due to its wireless tracking method and ensure safe use inside the mouth. Our tracking module is embedded in a headset to be portable and simple to use while being affordable by relying on the mass-produced components. The classical implementation of PML has many shortcomings that limit its practicality for real-world applications because it is computationally intensive due to its iterative algorithm, subject to local minimum convergence issues, and sensitive to its initial state and calibration parameters. Additionally, its physical model is an approximation that is only valid in limited tracking conditions. In this paper, we investigated the potential of deep learning to create a PML model for tongue tracking by training a feedforward neural network (3 layers, 100 neurons per layer) on a dataset composed of similar to 17 million states spanning a volume of 10 x 10 x 10 cm(3). Our PML was validated on 337000 states in a 4 x 6 x 7 cm(3) volume and tested on 100000 samples emulating a more natural tongue motion with curves and twists. A fully automated SD positional stage was engineered by our team to collect these large datasets of the 5D magnet states. Our PML prediction, limited to the magnet's 3D positions in this paper, reaches positional errors of 1.4 mm (median) and 1.8 mm (Q3).","Algorithm,articulograph,biomedical device,deep learning,machine learning,magnetometers,motion tracking,neural network,nonlinear optimization,permanent magnet localization,speech,tongue tracking,wearable",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"ELECTROMAGNETIC,ARTICULOGRAPHY,SPEECH,RECOGNITION,ALGORITHM,POSITION,ELECTROPALATOGRAPHY,MOVEMENTS,ACCURACY,POINTS,ADULTS",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,,

Firstly, we register two images by Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) feature points, the nearest neighbor and the next nearest neighbor distance ratio method to eliminate the spatial difference between the source images. Secondly, we use Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to achieve precise matching of feature points. Then, according to the transformation parameters obtained by RANSAC algorithm, we perform spatial transformation on the floating image to complete the registration. Finally, we obtain the low-frequency sub-band and high-frequency sub-band of the image to be fused by NSCT decomposition. The low-frequency sub-band is fused by the regional energy. The high-frequency sub-bands are studied using a simplified-PCNN model and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The link strength of the simplified-PCNN is an improved Laplacian energy and the images are fused based on the number of times the pixels are ignited. The proposed method has higher average gradient (AG) value and information entropy (IE) value and lower relative global dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS) than the existing fusion methods of the fundus image.

Indeed, understanding the fundamental aspects of oxygen diffusion is important to develop new materials for this application. In this work, Nd(1-x)AE(x)BaInO(4-x/2) (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds have been studied by MD simulations focusing on oxygen diffusion mechanisms. Two general clustering methods were used, namely a convex hull classification method and a DBSCAN machine learning algorithm, to identify oxygen ion diffusion pathways. Here, relevant details are provided for an efficient use of these two approaches during MD analysis of ion conductors. The calculations show that Ca is the most favorable dopant for substituting Nd in NdBaInO4, while Ba is the least desired. Indeed, the substitution of Nd by Ca hardly changes the pristine lattice parameters of NdBaInO4 and leads to the highest oxygen diffusion coefficient compared to other dopants. The oxygen vacancies induced by doping mainly locate on two specific oxygen sites over four oxygen sites available. Concerning the diffusion process, jumps involving these two sites play the main role and are associated with smaller migration enthalpies. For the main diffusion path, ions migrate along the b (2 routes) and c (4 routes) directions. Some other oxygen sites can be considered as barriers for the diffusion process inducing a strong anisotropy in the diffusion process. Additionally, the residence time analysis of oxygen ions confirms that ions at different sites have different motion abilities. As a whole, the approach presented here can be extrapolated to other ion conductors for gaining detailed information about the diffusion process.","OXIDE-ION CONDUCTIVITY,PEROVSKITE-RELATED STRUCTURE,LAYERED PEROVSKITES,VACANCY MIGRATION,SURFACE EXCHANGE,SIMULATIONS,TRANSPORT,DEFECT,REPRESENTATION,ELECTROLYTES",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,3.802,"OXIDE-ION,CONDUCTIVITY,PEROVSKITE-RELATED,STRUCTURE,LAYERED,PEROVSKITES,VACANCY,MIGRATION,SURFACE,EXCHANGE,SIMULATIONS,TRANSPORT,DEFECT,REPRESENTATION,ELECTROLYTES",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

Traditional biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint, voice, face, iris and signature may not meet the demand for higher security. At present, the utility of biological signals in the area of security became popular. ECG signal is getting wide attention to use it as a tool for biometric recognition in authentication applications. ECG signals can provide more accurate biometrics for personal identity recognition. In machine learning, over-fitting is one of the major problems when working with a large data set of features so that an effective statistical technique is needed to control it. In this research, ECG signals are acquired from 20 individuals over 6 months in the MIT-BIH ECG-ID database. Altogether, a high-dimensional (N = 72) set of ECG features are extracted. These features are further fed to an algorithm, which reduces the feature space by classifying vital features and avoiding random, correlated and over-fitted features to increase the prediction accuracy. In this paper, a new intelligent statistical learning method, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), is proposed to select appropriate features for identification. The refined features thus obtained are trained with popular machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, multi-class one-against-all support vector machine and K-nearest neighbour (K-NN).

In this paper, a prediction model based on an improved back-propagation neural network was adopted to investigate the combinations of deformation temperature and degree at different strain rates and post-forging cooling modes. There exist reasonable combinations under a strain rate of 0.01 s(-1) and air cooling or a strain rate of 0.1 s(-1) and water quenching. The dependence of final microstructural feature parameters on forging parameters was obtained for the two cases. Targeting ideal tri-modal microstructure feature parameters, the allowable ranges of the forging parameters were obtained in reverse. The results show that the allowable ranges under a strain rate of 0.01 s(-1) and air cooling are wider. This provides a guide to obtain a tri-modal microstructure by conventional forging combined with subsequent heat treatment during actual production.","ISOTHERMAL HOT COMPRESSION,TITANIUM-ALLOY,PROCESSING PARAMETERS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS,PHASE-TRANSFORMATION,EVOLUTION,ALPHA,DEFORMATION,DEPENDENCE",Article,"SPRINGER, 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Mineralogy,Mining & Mineral Processing",,2.989,"ISOTHERMAL,HOT,COMPRESSION,TITANIUM-ALLOY,PROCESSING,PARAMETERS,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS,PHASE-TRANSFORMATION,EVOLUTION,ALPHA,DEFORMATION,DEPENDENCE",JOM,,

In this field, machine learning techniques play a key role. However, the amount of health data acquired from digital machines has high dimensionality and not all data acquired from digital machines are relevant for a particular disease. Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome including several specific diseases, and it is a good model to implement machine learning analyses. In this work, we applied five feature selection algorithms to identify the set of relevant features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images of the main areas affected by PPA from patient records. On the other hand, we carried out classification and clustering algorithms before and after the feature selection process to contrast both results with those obtained in a previous work. We aimed to find the best classifier and the more relevant features from the WEKA tool to propose further a framework for automatic help on diagnosis. Dataset contains data from 150 FDG-PET imaging studies of 91 patients with a clinic prognosis of PPA, which were examined twice, and 28 controls. Our method comprises six different stages: (i) feature extraction, (ii) expertise knowledge supervision (iii) classification process, (iv) comparing classification results for feature selection, (v) clustering process after feature selection, and (vi) comparing clustering results with those obtained in a previous work.
Results: Experimental tests confirmed clustering results from a previous work. Although classification results for some algorithms are not decisive for reducing features precisely, Principal Components Analisys (PCA) results exhibited similar or even better performances when compared to those obtained with all features.
Conclusions: Although reducing the dimensionality does not means a general improvement, the set of features is almost halved and results are better or quite similar. Finally, it is interesting how these results expose a finer grain classification of patients according to the neuroanatomy of their disease.","Supervised algorithm,Unsupervised algorithm,Clustering Analysis",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,,"PRIMARY,PROGRESSIVE,APHASIA,FDG-PET,APRAXIA,TIME",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6788103?pdf=render,

The resulting potentials are accurate and robust for the wide range of configurations that occur during structure searching, despite only requiring a relatively small number of single-point DFT calculations on small unit cells.

Nevertheless, during the design process of piles, due to the intrinsic complexity as well as various design variables, the internal stress state related to pile drivability remains unclear, which makes the analysis imprecise. Thus, the development of an accurate predictive model becomes emergent. This paper presents a practical approach to assess pile drivability in relation to the prediction of Maximum compressive stresses and Blow per foot using a series of machine learning algorithms. A database of more than 4000 piles is employed to construct random forest regression (RFR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. The 10-fold cross-validation method and Lasso regularisation are adapted to obtain the model of superior generalisation ability and better persuasive results. Lastly, the results of RFR and MARS models were compared and evaluated in accordance with the goodness of fit, running time and interpretability. The results show that the RFR model performs better than the MARS in terms of fitting and operational efficiency, but is short of interpretability.","Random forest regression,multivariate adaptive regression splines,pile drivability,cross-validation,Lasso regularisation",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Geology",,3.14,"MODEL,SELECTION,PREDICTION,CAPACITY",GEORISK-ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK FOR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND GEOHAZARDS,,

An extended-wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (EWDRS) technique was evaluated for its ability to differentiate between and classify different skin and tissue types in an in vivo pig model.
Materials and methods
EWDRS recordings (450-1550 nm) were made on skin with different degrees of pigmentation as well as on the pig snout and tongue. The recordings were used to train a support vector machine to identify and classify the different skin and tissue types.
Results
The resulting EWDRS curves for each skin and tissue type had a unique profile. The support vector machine was able to classify each skin and tissue type with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. The sensitivity and specificity were between 96.4 and 100.0% for all skin and tissue types.
Conclusion
EWDRS can be used in vivo to differentiate between different skin and tissue types with good accuracy. Further development of the technique may potentially lead to a novel diagnostic tool for e.g. non-invasive tumor margin delineation.","DIAGNOSIS,METAANALYSIS,DERMOSCOPY,MELANOMA",Article,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE, 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,3.788,"DIAGNOSIS,METAANALYSIS,DERMOSCOPY,MELANOMA",PLOS ONE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6786558?pdf=render,

In OAR segmentation of the head and neck computed tomography (CT), the low-contrast and surrounding adhesion tissues of the parotids, thyroids, and optic nerves result in the difficulty in segmentation and lower accuracy of automatic segmentation for these organs than the other organs. In this paper, we propose a cascaded network structure to delineate these three OARs for NPC radiotherapy by combining deep learning and Boosting algorithm. Materials and methods The CT images of 140 NPC patients treated with radiotherapy were collected, and each of the three OAR annotations was respectively delineated by an experienced rater and reviewed by a professional radiologist (with 10 yr of experience). The datasets (140 patients) were divided into a training set (100 patients), a validation set (20 patients), and a test set (20 patients). From the Boosting method for combining multiple classifiers, three cascaded CNNs for segmentation were combined. The first network was trained with the traditional approach. The second one was trained on patterns (pixels) filtered by the first net. That is, the second machine recognized a mix of patterns (pixels), 50% of which was accurately identified by the first net. Finally, the third net was trained on the new patterns (pixels) screened jointly by the first and second networks. During the test, the outputs of the three nets were considered to obtain the final output. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (95% HD), and volume overlap error (VOE) were used to assess the method performance. Results The mean DSC (%) values were above 92.26 for the parotids, above 92.29 for the thyroids, and above 89.37 for the optic nerves. The mean 95% HDs (mm) were approximately 3.08 for the parotids, 2.64 for the thyroids, and 2.03 for the optic nerves. The mean VOE (%) values were approximately 14.16 for the parotids, 14.94 for the thyroids, and 19.07 for the optic nerves. Conclusion The proposed cascaded deep learning structure could achieve high performance compared with existing single-network or other segmentation algorithms.","boosting,deep learning,nasopharyngeal carcinoma,organs-at-risk,segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"PAROTID-GLAND,INJURY,HEAD,RADIOTHERAPY,IMAGES,VALIDATION,ALGORITHM,MR",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Because of the nonlinear correlation between the dose distribution and the activity distribution of positron emitters in addition to the presence of noise, machine learning approaches were proposed to establish their relationship. Materials/methods Simulations were carried out with a spot-scanning proton system using GATE-8.0 and Geant4-10.3 toolkit with a computed tomography (CT)-based patient phantom. The one-dimensional (1D) distributions of positron emitters and radiation dose were obtained. A feedforward neural network classification model comprising two hidden layers, was developed to estimate whether the range is within a preset threshold. A recurrent neural network (RNN) regression model comprising three layers and ten neurons in each hidden layer was developed to estimate dose distribution. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Results The feasibility of proton range and dose verification using the proposed neural network framework was demonstrated. The feedforward NN model achieves high classification accuracy close to 100% for individual classes without bias. The RNN model is able to accurately predict the 1D dose distribution for different energies and irradiation positions. When the SNR of the input activity profiles is above 4, the framework is able to predict with an MAE of 0.60 mm and an MSE of 0.066. Moreover, the model demonstrates a good capability of generalization. Conclusion The RNN model is found to be effective in identifying the relationship between the distributions of dose and positron emitters. The machine learning-based framework and RNN models may be a useful tool to allow for accurate online range and dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters.","dose verification,positron emitters,proton therapy,range verification,recurrent neural network",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"IN-BEAM,PET,PROMPT-GAMMA,VIVO,VERIFICATION,DELIVERY,PATIENT,SYSTEM,CAMERA,DISTRIBUTIONS,SIMULATION,NUCLEI",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,
27,Towards a mix design model for the prediction of permeability of hot-mix asphalt,221,,637-642,"Blaauw Sheldon A.,Maina James W.,Horak Emile","Blaauw SA,Maina JW,Horak E",Maina JW,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.082,University of Pretoria,"Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) is a designed pre-mix of graded aggregates and bituminous-based binder, hot applied on road pavements to provide a smooth and safe riding surface and protect the underlying layers. Current HMA mix design methods are focusing, mostly, on the strength of the mixture. However, the mixture permeability, which is an equally important performance parameter of an HMA layer - strongly influencing the durability of the HMA and underlying layers - is not always pertinently used as a mix design parameter. Exclusion of permeability is attributed to uncertainty on the accuracy of measured permeability, as well as poor correlation among predicted, field, and laboratory results. In this paper, it is hypothesised that practical and reliable methods are available to predict and measure the permeability of HMA in the field and laboratory as well as to successfully relate permeability parameters to long-term performance of HMA. The objective of the study is to establish these relationships and validate an HMA design model to predict durability. Numerous theoretical models were evaluated and the selected model is based on regression analysis of field data. Initially, predominant variables influencing layer permeability were found to be void proportion, binder content as well as aggregate grading and packing. Subsequently, regression analyses of data showed that within reasonable variation of the other variables, layer permeability is strongly correlated to aggregate grading and packing, as described by rational Bailey ratios, hence the focus of refining the model on the latter parameters. The research confirmed the hypothesis by showing an acceptable level of confidence in the relationships. The study objective was achieved to the extent that the predicted levels of permeability correlated well with field observations of durability performance. This was enhanced with machine learning modelling of the data sets available from recent as-built road sections with similar design and specifications and different permeability observations in the field. It is concluded that permeability can indeed be introduced as a primary design objective in HMA design practice. It is recommended that, while further machine learning refinement is being done, the model be used by designers in enhancing the prediction of design life of HMA surfacing and structural pavement layers.

The progressive nature of this disease makes it inevitable to detect this disease in its early stages, leads to a greater demand for developing non-obstructive and reliable technology for COPD detection. The use of highly patient-effort dependent, time-consuming, and expensive methods are some major inherent limitations of previous techniques. Lack of knowledge about the disease and inadequacy of proper diagnostic tool for early detection of COPD is another reason behind the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. For this reason, this study aims to explore the utility of ECG Derived Respiration (EDR) for classification between COPD patients and normal healthy subjects as EDR can be easily extracted from ECG. ECG and respiration signals collected from 30 normal and 30 COPD subjects were analysed. Error calculation and statistical analysis were performed to observe the similarity between original respiration and EDR signal. The morphological pattern changes of respiration and EDR signals were analysed and three different features were extracted from those. Classification was performed by different classifiers employing Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Apart from obtaining comparable classification performance it was seen that EDR has better potential than the original respiration signal for classification of COPD from normal population.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Electrocardiogram,ECG derived respiration,Respiration,Classification",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Engineering,,1.467,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,OBSTRUCTIVE,PULMONARY-DISEASE,VOLATILE,ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,HEALTHY,DIAGNOSIS",AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE,,

High-throughput electronic structure theory may help to explore the vast chemical space available and offers a design tool to the experimental synthesis. This method efficiently predicts the elementary magnetic properties of a compound and its thermodynamical stability, but it is blind to information concerning the magnetic critical temperature. Here we introduce a range of machine-learning models to predict the Curie temperature T-C of ferromagnets. The models are constructed by using experimental data for about 2500 known magnets and consider the chemical composition of a compound as the only feature determining T-C. Thus we are able to establish a one-to-one relation between the chemical composition and the critical temperature. We show that the best model can predict T-C's with an accuracy of about 50 K. Most importantly our model is able to make predictions in regions of the chemical space, where only a small fraction of the data was considered for training. Furthermore, it is able to assess the uncertainty of such predictions.

The objective of this work is to monitor porosity in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing of nickel alloy 718 (popularly called Inconel 718) test parts using in-process optical emission spectroscopy. To realize this objective, cylinder-shaped test parts are built under different processing conditions on a commercial L-PBF machine instrumented with an in-situ multispectral photodetector sensor. Optical emission signatures are captured continuously during the build by the multispectral sensor. Following processing, the porosity-level within each layer of a test part is quantified using X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). The graph Fourier transform coefficients are derived layer-by-layer from signatures acquired from the multispectral photodetector sensor. These graph Fourier transform coefficients are subsequently invoked as input features within various machine learning models to predict the percentage porosity-level in each layer with CT data taken as ground truth. This approach is found to predict the porosity on a layer-by-layer basis with an accuracy of similar to 90% (F-score) in a computation time less than 0.5 seconds.

Machine learning optimized MMD further aids to reveal immune landscape across various carcinomas critically needed in disease management and clinical interventions. This unified data source may serve as an excellent training or test set to apply, develop, and refine machine learning algorithms that can be tapped to better define genomic landscape of human cancers.","GENE-EXPRESSION,RNA-SEQ,BIOCONDUCTOR,SOFTWARE",Article; Data Paper,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,9.051,"GENE-EXPRESSION,RNA-SEQ,BIOCONDUCTOR,SOFTWARE",SCIENTIFIC DATA,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0207-2.pdf,

In a conventional graph definition, atomic symbols and bond orders are employed as node and edge labels, respectively. In this study, we developed new graph definitions using the assignment of atom and bond types in the force fields of molecular dynamics methods as node and edge labels, respectively.

However, no simple and reliable prediction model has been identified. Here, we aimed to develop and validate predictive models for the MTX response to JIA using machine learning based on electronic medical record (EMR) before and after administering MTX.
Materials and Methods: Data of 362 JIA patients with MTX mono-therapy were retrospectively collected from EMR between January 2008 and October 2018. DAS44/ESR-3 simplified standard was used to evaluate the MTX response. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) algorithms were applied to develop and validate models with 5-fold cross-validation on the randomly split training and test set. Data of 13 patients additionally collected were used for external validation.
Results: The XGBoost screened out the optimal 10 pre-administration features and 6 mix-variables. The XGBoost established the best model based on the 10 pre-administration variables. The performances were accuracy 91.78%, sensitivity 90.70%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 97.00%, respectively. Similarly, the XGBoost developed a better model based on the 6 mix-variables, whose performances were accuracy 94.52%, sensitivity 95.35%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 99.00%, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on common EMR data, we developed two MTX response predictive models with excellent performance in JIA using machine learning. These models can predict the MTX efficacy early and accurately, which provides powerful decision support for doctors to make or adjust therapeutic scheme before or after treatment.","methotrexate,juvenile idiopathic arthritis,prediction model,machine learning,clinical response",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,,"RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS,DISEASE-ACTIVITY,PATHWAY,GENES,POLYMORPHISMS,EFFICACY,CLASSIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION,TOXICITY,ADHESION,COHORT",FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.01155,

These interesting far- and near-field optical characteristics of the plasmonic NPs can be typically obtained from numerical simulations for theoretical guidance of NP design. However, traditional numerical simulations encounter irreconcilable conflicts between the accuracy and speed due to the high demand of computing power. In this work, we utilized the machine learning method, specifically the deep neural network (DNN), to establish mapping between the far-field spectra/near-field distribution and dimensional parameters of three types of plasmonic NPs including nanospheres, nanorods, and dimers. After the training process, both the forward prediction of far-field optical properties and the inverse prediction of on-demand dimensional parameters of NPs can be accomplished accurately and efficiently with the DNN. More importantly, we have achieved for the first time ultrafast and accurate prediction of two-dimensional on-resonance electromagnetic enhancement distributions around NPs by greatly reducing the amount of electromagnetic data via screening and resampling methods. These near-field predictions can be realized typically in less than 10(-2) seconds on a laptop, which is 6 orders faster than typical numerical simulations implemented on a server. Therefore, we demonstrate that the DNN is an ultrafast, highly efficient, and computing resource-saving tool to investigate the far- and near-field optical properties of plasmonic NPs, especially for a number of important nano-optical applications such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, solar cells, and metamaterials.","DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS,ENHANCED RAMAN TAGS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,NANOSTRUCTURES,CLASSIFICATION,FLUORESCENCE,SCATTERING,CONVERSION",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,7.632,"DEEP,NEURAL-NETWORKS,ENHANCED,RAMAN,TAGS,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,NANOSTRUCTURES,CLASSIFICATION,FLUORESCENCE,SCATTERING,CONVERSION",NANOSCALE,,

This kind of memristor in this paper is named STM -> LTM memristor. In some of these experimental researches, the learning-experience behavior observed in the ""learning-forgetting-relearning"" experiment is also reported. When the memristor is restimulated by pulses after forgetting the STM, its memory will quickly return to the highest state that has been reached before the forgetting period, and the memory recovery during the relearning period is obviously faster than the memory formation in the first learning process. In this paper, the behavior of the existing STM -> LTM memristor model in the ""learning-forgetting-relearning"" experiment is further discussed. If w(max), the upper bound of the memory level, is a constant with a value of 1, the STM -> LTM memristor model exhibits no learning-experience behavior, and this model shows a faster relearning behavior in the ""learning-forgetting-relearning"" experiment. The relearning process is faster because the memory forgetting during pulse-to-pulse interval in the relearning process is slower than that in the first learning process. In the STM -> LTM memristor model with learning-experience behavior, w(max) is redesigned as a state variable in [0,1], and its value will be influenced by the applied voltage. The memory formation in the first learning process is relatively slow because tu max limits the memory formation speed when the pulse is applied. After the forgetting process, the limitation of tu max on the pulse-induced memory formation is less obvious, so the memory of the device increases at a faster speed during the memory recovery of the relearning process. In this case, the forgetting speed still becomes slower after each pulse has been applied. If the pulse-induced w(max) increase is so fast that w(max) will quickly increase to its upper bound after a few pulses have been applied in the first learning process, and the learning-experience behavior is similar to the faster relearning behavior when w(max) = 1. In most of experimental research papers about the STM -> LTM memristor, the change of the memristance can be explained by the formation and annihilation of the conductive channel between two electrodes of a memristor. During a certain period of time, the ions (or vacancies), which can be used to form the conductive channel, are only those that are around the conductive channel, which indicates that there should be an upper bound for the size of the conductive channel within this time period. The area in which ions (or vacancies) can be used to form the conductive channel is called the surrounding area of the conductive channel. In the model, w(max) can be understood as the size of the conductive channel's surrounding area, and it describes the upper bound of the width of the conductive channel.","memristor,learning-experience behavior,short-term memory,long-term memory",Article,"CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC, P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",Physics,,0.618,"LONG-TERM,POTENTIATION,SYNAPTIC,PLASTICITY,MEMORY",ACTA PHYSICA SINICA,https://doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190808,

The subject of the research involved the computed tomography images of vertebrae on the thoraco-lumbar region. The data set contained the images of healthy patients and patients diagnosed with osteoporosis. On the basis of fractal analysis and feature selection by linear stepwise regression, three descriptors were obtained. They were two fractal dimensions calculated with the variation method (transect - first differences and filter 1 estimators) and one fractal lacunarity calculated by means of the box counting method. The first two descriptors were obtained as a result of the analysis of grey images, and the third was the result of analysis of binary images. The effectiveness of the descriptors was verified using six popular supervised classification methods: linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes classifier, decision tree, K-nearest neighbours and random forests. The best results were obtained using the K-nearest neighbours classifier; they were as follows: overall classification accuracy - 81%, classification sensitivity - 78%, classification specificity - 90%, positive predictive value - 90%, and negative predictive value - 77%.

Stokes method allows estimating VAR in frontal X-rays from the relative position of the pedicles and the vertebral body. This method requires identifying these landmarks for each vertebral level, which is time-consuming. In this work, a quasi-automated method for pedicle detection and VAR estimation was proposed.
Method A total of 149 healthy and adolescent idiopathic scoliotic (AIS) subjects were included in this retrospective study. Their frontal X-rays were collected from multiple sites and manually annotated to identify the spinal midline and pedicle positions. Then, an automated pedicle detector was developed based on image analysis, machine learning and fast manual identification of a few landmarks. VARs were calculated using the Stokes method in a validation dataset of 11 healthy (age 6-33 years) and 46 AIS subjects (age 6-16 years, Cobb 10 degrees-46 degrees), both from detected pedicles and those manually annotated to compare them. Sensitivity of pedicle location to the manual inputs was quantified on 20 scoliotic subjects, using 10 perturbed versions of the manual inputs.
Results Pedicles centers were localized with a precision of 84% and mean difference of 1.2 +/- 1.2 mm, when comparing with manual identification. Comparison of VAR values between automated and manual pedicle localization yielded a signed difference of - 0.2 +/- 3.4 degrees. The uncertainty on pedicle location was smaller than 2 mm along each image axis.
Conclusion The proposed method allowed calculating VAR values in frontal radiographs with minimal user intervention and robust quasi-automated pedicle localization.

The need for using multiple light sources to read out the wavelength-multiplexed data from optically encoded organic dyes, photoblinking from quantum dots, and autofluorescence from carbon dots are some typical examples. In order to address these restrictions, we exploited our previously devised nanoimprinting-exposure-thermal-treatment (NETT) data storage approach to present a new structural-colour-based regime for optical encoding of high-security QR codes. The angle-dependent readability of our diffraction-based nanostructures poses an enhanced optical security feature that can substitute the existing inefficient encoding strategies by eliminating the constraints associated with them. Additionally, in comparison with conventional optical encoding media, using the long-lasting photocrosslinked SU-8 in the NETT method considerably enhances the life expectancy of the proposed QR codes. Also, considering the rapid NETT-based Ni stamp origination method, which was previously introduced by our group, mass-generation of the proposed codes is feasible. Owing to the special optically variable effects provided by the nanostructures, duplication of our QR codes is very difficult. The colour code design, which embeds 766 characters in 2907 modules in red, green and blue channels, was generated and fabricated onto generic nanostructure arrays using the NETT process. The encoded information was successfully read out from the pattern using a broadband light source and a digital camera. Higher capacities are also deemed to be reachable by implementing image processing and machine learning algorithms to overcome in-channel module recognition and cross-channel interferences.","QR code,optical security,multiplexing,diffractive nanostructures,structural colours,laser patterning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,3.618,"HIGH-CAPACITY,PATTERNS,CYTOTOXICITY,DESIGN,FILMS",NANOTECHNOLOGY,,

However, most deep learning-based techniques are built on two-stage, proposal-driven detectors using less complex image data, which could be restricted for practical applications and possible integration within intelligent autonomous inspection systems. In this study, a faster, simpler single-stage detector is proposed based on a real-time object detection technique, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), for detecting multiple concrete bridge damages. A field inspection images dataset labeled with four types of concrete damages (crack, pop-out, spalling, and exposed rebar) is used for training and testing of YOLOv3. To enhance the detection accuracy, the original YOLOv3 is further improved by introducing a novel transfer learning method with fully pretrained weights from a geometrically similar dataset. Batch renormalization and focal loss are also incorporated to increase the accuracy. Testing results show that the improved YOLOv3 has a detection accuracy of up to 80% and 47% at the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metrics of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively.

In this paper, a new method for heart sound features extraction for the classification of non-segmented signals using instantaneous frequency was proposed. The method has two major phases: the first phase is to estimate the instantaneous frequency of the recorded signal; the second phase is to extract a set of eleven features from the estimated instantaneous frequency. The method was tested into two different datasets, one for binary classification (Normal and Abnormal) and the other for multi-classification (Five Classes) to ensure the robustness of the extracted features.

The architecture was developed to allow communication among patients, physicians, and families to determine each patient's medication intake and self-monitoring of blood pressure rates. Concerning the medication schedule, the system is designed to follow a predefined prescription, adapting itself to undesired events, such as mistakenly taking medication or forgetting to take medication on time. When covering the blood pressure measurement, it incorporates best medical practices, registering the actual values in recommended frequency and form, trying to avoid the known ""white-coat effect."" We assume that taking medicine precisely and measuring blood pressure correctly may lead to good adherence to the treatment. The system uses commercial consumer electronic devices and can be replicated in any home equipped with a standard personal computer and Internet access. The resulting architecture has four layers. The first is responsible for adding electronic devices that typically exist in today's homes to the system. The second is a preprocessing layer that filters the data generated from the patient's behavior. The third is a reasoning layer that decides how to act based on the patient's activities observed. Finally, the fourth layer creates messages that should drive the reactions of all involved actors. The reasoning layer takes into consideration the patient's schedule and medication-taking activity data and uses implicit algorithms based on the J48, RepTree, and RandomTree decision tree models to infer the adherence. The algorithms were first adjusted using one academic machine learning and data mining tool. The system communicates with users through smartphones (anytime and anywhere) and smart TVs (in the patient's home) by using the 3G/4G and WiFi infrastructure. It interacts automatically through social networks with doctors and relatives when changes or mistakes in medication intake and blood pressure mean values are detected. By associating the blood pressure data with the history of medication intake, our system can indicate the treatment adherence and help patients to achieve better treatment results. Comparisons with similar research were made, highlighting our findings.","assisted living,health information management,ambient intelligence,smart homes,medical treatment,medical expert systems",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,,"BLOOD-PRESSURE,MEDICATION,ADHERENCE,CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE,HEALTH-CARE,HOME,INTERNET,TAXONOMY,THINGS",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6832274?pdf=render,

However, most of them still lack the ability to recognize human emotions with higher classification accuracy incorporating a limited number of bio-sensors. In the domain of machine learning, ensemble learning methods have been successfully applied to solve different types of real-world machine learning problems which require improved classification accuracies. Emphasising on that, this research suggests an ensemble learning approach for developing a machine learning model that can recognize four major human emotions namely: anger; sadness; joy; and pleasure incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As feature extraction methods, this analysis combines four ECG signal based techniques, namely: heart rate variability; empirical mode decomposition; with-in beat analysis; and frequency spectrum analysis. The first three feature extraction methods are well-known ECG based feature extraction techniques mentioned in the literature, and the fourth technique is a novel method proposed in this study. The machine learning procedure of this investigation evaluates the performance of a set of well-known ensemble learners for emotion classification and further improves the classification results using feature selection as a prior step to ensemble model training. Compared to the best performing single biosensor based model in the literature, the developed ensemble learner has the accuracy gain of 10.77%. Furthermore, the developed model outperforms most of the multiple biosensor based emotion recognition models with a significantly higher classification accuracy gain.","bio-signal processing,wearable computing,ensemble learning,electrocardiogram,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"EMPIRICAL,MODE,DECOMPOSITION,ECG,SIGNALS,TRANSFORM,SPACE",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6832168?pdf=render,

The myoelectric prosthesis, using signals from residual stump muscles, is aimed at restoring the function of such lost limbs seamlessly. Unfortunately, the acquisition and use of such myosignals are cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, once acquired, it usually requires heavy computational power to turn it into a user control signal. Its transition to a practical prosthesis solution is still being challenged by various factors particularly those related to the fact that each amputee has different mobility, muscle contraction forces, limb positional variations and electrode placements. Thus, a solution that can adapt or otherwise tailor itself to each individual is required for maximum utility across amputees. Modified machine learning schemes for pattern recognition have the potential to significantly reduce the factors (movement of users and contraction of the muscle) affecting the traditional electromyography (EMG)-pattern recognition methods. Although recent developments of intelligent pattern recognition techniques could discriminate multiple degrees of freedom with high-level accuracy, their efficiency level was less accessible and revealed in real-world (amputee) applications. This review paper examined the suitability of upper limb prosthesis (ULP) inventions in the healthcare sector from their technical control perspective. More focus was given to the review of real-world applications and the use of pattern recognition control on amputees. We first reviewed the overall structure of pattern recognition schemes for myo-control prosthetic systems and then discussed their real-time use on amputee upper limbs. Finally, we concluded the paper with a discussion of the existing challenges and future research recommendations.","Myo-prosthesis,EMG,Pattern recognition,myosignals",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"UPPER-LIMB,PROSTHESES,TARGETED,MUSCLE,REINNERVATION,MYOELECTRIC,CONTROL,CLASSIFICATION,ELECTRODE,SIGNALS,SYSTEM,MOTION,PERFORMANCE,INTERFACE",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832440,

These models can learn personalized glucose-insulin dynamics based on the sensor data collected by monitoring several aspects of the physiological condition and daily activity of an individual. Until now, the prevalent approach for developing data-driven prediction models was to collect as much data as possible to help physicians and patients optimally adjust therapy. The objective of this work was to investigate the minimum data variety, volume, and velocity required to create accurate person-centric short-term prediction models. We developed a series of these models using different machine learning time series forecasting techniques suitable for execution within a wearable processor. We conducted an extensive passive patient monitoring study in real-world conditions to build an appropriate data set. The study involved a subset of type 1 diabetic subjects wearing a flash glucose monitoring system. We comparatively and quantitatively evaluated the performance of the developed data-driven prediction models and the corresponding machine learning techniques. Our results indicate that very accurate short-term prediction can be achieved by only monitoring interstitial glucose data over a very short time period and using a low sampling frequency. The models developed can predict glucose levels within a 15-min horizon with an average error as low as 15.43 mg/dL using only 24 historic values collected within a period of sex hours, and by increasing the sampling frequency to include 72 values, the average error is reduced to 10.15 mg/dL. Our prediction models are suitable for execution within a wearable device, requiring the minimum hardware requirements while at simultaneously achieving very high prediction accuracy.","continuous glucose monitoring,wearable devices,short-term prediction,univariate time series,machine learning,experimental evaluation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"ARTIFICIAL,PANCREAS,TIME,PERFORMANCE",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/20/4482/pdf,

However, recent Internet of Things (IoT) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) so that, with the proper Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an 'on-the-fly' approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, CGM study has been carried out with 25 DM1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 11.65 mg/dL in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an RMSE of 19.90 mg/dL. Thus, this paper concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices.","continuous glucose monitoring,wearable devices,constrained devices,time series forecasting,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,SENSORS,https://iris.uniroma1.it/bitstream/11573/1332757/1/Rodr%c3%adguez-Rodr%c3%adguez_On-the-Possibility_2019.pdf,

Numerous studies have been conducted to detect the user's emotions from physiological data. Among a myriad of target emotions, boredom, in particular, has been suggested to cause not only medical issues but also challenges in various facets of daily life. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants' questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781).

In this paper, we designed a U-shaped convolutional neural network with multi-scale input and multi-kernel modules (MSMKU) for OD and OC segmentation. Such a design gives MSMKU a rich receptive field and is able to effectively represent multi-scale features. In addition, we designed a mixed maximum loss minimization learning strategy (MMLM) for training the proposed MSMKU. This training strategy can adaptively sort the samples by the loss function and re-weight the samples through data enhancement, thereby synchronously improving the prediction performance of all samples. Experiments show that the proposed method has obtained a state-of-the-art breakthrough result for OD and OC segmentation on the RIM-ONE-V3 and DRISHTI-GS datasets.

To demonstrate the performance of this technique, we built a high-throughput, compact and cost-effective prototype for detecting MCF7 cancer cells spiked in whole blood samples.

Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a promising alternative among currently available technologies for carbon capture due to its low energy requirements. Still, the design of the appropriate PSA cycle for a given adsorbent material is a challenge that must be addressed to make PSA commercially competitive for carbon capture applications. In this work, we propose and test a model reduction-based approach that systematically generates low-order representations of rigorous PSA models. These reduced-order models are obtained by training artificial neural networks on data collected from full partial differential algebraic equation (PDAE) model simulations. The main contribution of this paper is the development of surrogate models for every possible step in PSA cycles: pressurization, adsorption, and depressurization steps in cocurrent and counter-current operation. Three different PSA cycles (three-step, Skarstrom, and five-step cycle) for postcombustion carbon capture applications were employed for training purposes, and two adsorbents, Ni-MOF-74 and zeolite 13X, were chosen to evaluate the surrogate models under optimized cycle conditions. A good agreement was observed between the results of the ANN models and the PDAE simulations. Average mean square errors, for dimensionless state variables, of 1.7 x 10(-8), 5.8 x 10(-8), and 9.9 x 10(-7) were obtained for the three PSA cycles analyzed in this work, and the highest relative error, regarding the CO2 purity and recovery, was 1.42%.

We seek to determine whether these models are practical and feasible for use in training and teaching programmes. Eight radiologists of varying experience levels in reading mammograms reviewed 120 two-view digital mammography cases (59 cancers). Their search behaviour and decisions were captured using a head-mounted eye-tracking device and software allowing them to record their decisions. This information from radiologists was used to build an ensembled machine-learning model using top-down hierarchical deep convolution neural network. Separately, a model to determine type of missed cancer (search, perception or decision-making) was also built. Analysis and comparison of variants of these models using different convolution networks with and without transfer learning were also performed. Our ensembled deep-learning network architecture can be trained to learn about radiologists' attentional level and decisions. High accuracy (95%, p value approximately equal to 0 [better than dumb/random model]) and high agreement between true and predicted values (kappa = 0.83) in such modelling can be achieved. Transfer learning techniques improve by < 10% with the performance of this model. We also show that spatial convolution neural networks are insufficient in determining the type of missed cancers.

Our extensive experiments and analysis on two benchmarking and publicly available databases, namely the UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain and the BioVid, clearly show that our proposed method consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in automatic pain intensity estimation.","Deep learning,Convolutional neural network,Facial dynamics,Pain intensity estimation,Cross-architecture knowledge transfer,Healthcare",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,13.284,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11263-019-01191-3.pdf,
70,A new complement naive Bayesian approach for biomedical data classification,10,10,3889-3897,"Anagaw Amare,Chang Yang-Lang","Anagaw A,Chang YL",Chang YL,10.1007/s12652-018-1160-1,National Taipei University of Technology,"Biomedical data classification tasks are very challenging because data is usually large, noised and imbalanced. Particularly the noise can reduce system performance in terms of classification accuracy, time in building a classifier and the size of the classifier. Accordingly, most existing learning algorithms have integrated various approaches to enhance their learning abilities from noisy environments, but the existence of noise can still introduce serious negative impacts. A more reasonable solution might be to employ some preprocessing mechanisms to handle noisy instances before a learner is formed. Therefore, we introduce a method called double learning to improve the classification performance of our model. As to the author's knowledge, most of the previous works used the normal (noise free) instances for model construction (training) after the noise instances are isolated. This approach increases computational task on model construction for active learners and total computational time for passive learners. It also ignores minority data instance which leads to miss classification of instances from minority group as test cases. The main idea of this paper is to construct a model using noised instances. This approach minimizes the model construction time by reducing the number of instances and improves classification performance. Therefore, only the identified noised data are used for model construction instead of the normal (noise free) data. Since noised instances are used for model construction, the entire naive Bayesian working logic is reversed. This method is called complement naive Bayesian (CNB) which makes use of the idea of complement based learning to improve the accuracy performance. Finally, the performance of the proposed CNB is compared to naive Bayesian and some other classification algorithms with the single photon emission computed tomography, Indian liver patient dataset, Wilt and Tic-Tac-Toe endgame datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach has shown promising results in terms of computational time and accuracy performance on both balanced and imbalanced datasets used.","Biomedical data classification,Complement naive Bayesian,Double learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,"BREAST-CANCER,NOISE,QUALITY,MODEL",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of our database from January 2009 to June 2016 identified 141 locally advanced breast cancer patients who (1) underwent breast MRI prior to the initiation of NAC, (2) successfully completed adriamycin/taxane-based NAC, and (3) underwent surgical resection with available final surgical pathology data. Patients were classified into three groups based on their NAC response confirmed on final surgical pathology: complete (group 1), partial (group 2), and no response/progression (group 3). A total of 3107 volumetric slices of 141 tumors were evaluated. Breast tumor was identified on first T1 postcontrast dynamic images and underwent 3D segmentation. CNN consisted of ten convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and dropout of 50% after a fully connected layer. Dropout, augmentation, and L2 regularization were implemented to prevent overfitting of data. Non-linear functions were modeled by a rectified linear unit (ReLU). Batch normalization was used between the convolutional and ReLU layers to limit drift of layer activations during training. A three-class neoadjuvant prediction model was evaluated (group 1, group 2, or group 3). The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in three-class prediction of neoadjuvant treatment response. Three-class prediction discriminating one group from the other two was analyzed. Group 1 had a specificity of 95.1% +/- 3.1%, sensitivity of 73.9% +/- 4.5%, and accuracy of 87.7% +/- 0.6%. Group 2 (partial response) had a specificity of 91.6% +/- 1.3%, sensitivity of 82.4% +/- 2.7%, and accuracy of 87.7% +/- 0.6%.

To address this problem, previous studies suggested some criteria for describing the variations appearance of tumor cells relative to normal cells. However, these criteria were still assessed subjectively by pathologists. Previous studies used quantitative computer-extracted features for scoring. However, application of these tools is limited as further improvement in their accuracy is required. This study proposes COMPASS (COMputer-assisted analysis combined with Pathologist's ASSessment) for reproducible nuclear atypia scoring. COMPASS relies on both cytological criteria assessed subjectively by pathologists as well as computer-extracted textural features. Using machine learning, COMPASS combines these two sets of features and output nuclear atypia score. COMPASS's performance was evaluated using 300 images for which expert-consensus derived reference nuclear pleomorphism scores were available, and they were scanned by two scanners from different vendors. A personalized model was built for three pathologists who gave scores to six atypia-related criteria for each image. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used. COMPASS was trained and tested for each pathologist separately. Percentage agreement between COMPASS and the reference nuclear scores was 93.8%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for three pathologists. COMPASS's performance in nuclear grading was almost identical for both scanners, with Cohen's kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.86 for different pathologists and different scanners. Independently, the images were also assessed by two experienced senior pathologists. Cohen's kappa of COMPASS was comparable to the Cohen's kappa for two senior pathologists (0.79 and 0.68).","Breast,Breast cancer,Microscopy,Nuclear atypia grading,Nuclear pleomorphism grading,Pattern recognition",Article,"SPRINGER, 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,"FINE-NEEDLE-ASPIRATION,INTEROBSERVER,AGREEMENT,PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS,NOTTINGHAM,MODIFICATION,REPRODUCIBILITY,CARCINOMA,BLOOM,PLEOMORPHISM,EXPERIENCE,SYSTEM",JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6737167,

For this reason, finding optimum process parameters is essential, especially in process planning of individual tools. In the industry, manual experiments are carried out for the machine set up. This leads to high costs due to machine hours, labor and material costs. This paper presents a self-optimizing and adaptable process planning method to reduce costs for process planning and improve the process result. The developed method allows to identify optimum cutting speed and feed with respect to economic efficiency and quality for new tools without additional machining experiments. Geometric-kinematical cutting simulations in combination with empirical models are used to predict the process outcome. The empirical models are derived from machine learning and improved automatically with an increase of process data.

A trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tool that can estimate the effective local thermal conductivity for each finite element considering the influence of the presence of stagnant gas in the interstitial voids, gas pressure and the granular microstructure is used. This way of hierarchical coupling using ANN eliminates the need to perform thermal discrete element simulations for each finite element at every increment by directly predicting the effective local conductivity. The proposed hierarchical approach is applied to a breeder blanket of fusion reactor that consists of more than 15 million particles to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.

Our aim is to estimate the fractional abundance maps of the materials from the nonlinear hyperspectral data. The main disadvantage of using nonlinear mixing models is that the model parameters are not properly interpretable in terms of fractional abundances. Moreover, not all spectra of a hyperspectral dataset necessarily follow the same particular mixing model. In this work, we present a supervised method for nonlinear spectral unmixing. The method learns a mapping from a true hyperspectral dataset to corresponding linear spectra, composed of the same fractional abundances. A simple linear unmixing then reveals the fractional abundances. To learn this mapping, ground truth information is required, in the form of actual spectra and corresponding fractional abundances, along with spectra of the pure materials, obtained from a spectral library or available in the dataset. Three methods are presented for learning nonlinear mapping, based on Gaussian processes, kernel ridge regression, and feedforward neural networks.

Spectral power densities from five typical frequency bands (i.e., delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were extracted as features, which were then classified by either individual widely-used classifiers, namely k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (ADA), or an ensemble of some of them. The F-score was employed to select most discriminative features so that the dimension of features was reduced.

The aim of our research was to explore the epidemiology and risk factors of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.
Materials and Methods: A total of 975 patients with cirrhosis were selected into our study, and all participants were followed up for at least 28 days. Cox regression model and machine-learning algorithm were used to identify the importance of different risk factors, respectively. Finally, an improved prognostic model as Model for End-stage Liver Disease and metabolic acidosis (MELD-MA) was developed.
Results: Among the 975 patients with liver cirrhosis, 506 had metabolic acidosis, including 257 patients who had decompensated metabolic acidosis at ICU admission. The 28-day mortality was 41% (206/506) in patients with metabolic acidosis. Bilirubin (hazard ratio (HR): 1.023, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.011-1.036), international normalized ratio (HR: 1.527, 95% CI: 1.332-1.750), pH (HR: 0.173, 95% CI: 0.047-0.640), BE-Lac (HR: 0.907, 95% CI: 0.868-0.948), and BE-Na (HR: 0.923, 95% CI: 0.859-0.991) were considered as independent prognostic parameters for 28-day mortality. MELD-NA had significantly higher discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79) than MELD and Child-Pugh score.
Conclusion: Critically ill patients with cirrhosis have a high mortality rate and poor prognosis because of the high prevalence of metabolic acidosis.

Methods: Single-shot EPI is an efficient encoding technique, but does not lend itself well to high-resolution imaging because of severe distortion artifacts and blurring. Although msEPI can mitigate these artifacts, high-quality msEPI has been elusive because of phase mismatch arising from shot-to-shot variations which preclude the combination of the multiple-shot data into a single image. We utilize deep learning to obtain an interim image with minimal artifacts, which permits estimation of image phase variations attributed to shot-to-shot changes. These variations are then included in a joint virtual coil sensitivity encoding (JVC-SENSE) reconstruction to utilize data from all shots and improve upon the ML solution.
Results: Our combined ML + physics approach enabled R-inplane x multiband (MB) = 8-x 2-fold acceleration using 2 EPI shots for multiecho imaging, so that whole-brain T-2 and T-2* parameter maps could be derived from an 8.3-second acquisition at 1 x 1 x 3-mm(3) resolution. This has also allowed high-resolution diffusion imaging with high geometrical fidelity using 5 shots at Rinplane x MB = 9- x 2-fold acceleration. To make these possible, we extended the state-of-the-art MUSSELS reconstruction technique to simultaneous multislice encoding and used it as an input to our ML network.
Conclusion: Combination of ML and JVC-SENSE enabled navigator-free msEPI at higher accelerations than previously possible while using fewer shots, with reduced vulnerability to poor generalizability and poor acceptance of end-to-end ML approaches.","convolutional neural network,deep learning,joint reconstruction,machine learning,multishot EPI,parallel imaging",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"POCS-BASED,RECONSTRUCTION,PARALLEL,MRI,DIFFUSION,SENSE,EPI,ROBUST,GRAPPA,ALGORITHM,DWI",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6626584,

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to remove motion artifacts from 2D T2-weighted rapid acquisition with refocused echoes (RARE) images is introduced into a model-based data-consistency optimization to jointly search for 2D motion parameters and the uncorrupted image. Our separable motion model allows for efficient intrashot (line-by-line) motion correction of highly corrupted shots, as opposed to previous methods which do not scale well with this refinement of the motion model. Final image generation incorporates the motion parameters within a model-based image reconstruction. The method is tested in simulations and in vivo motion experiments of in-plane motion corruption.
Results: While the convolutional neural network alone provides some motion mitigation (at the expense of introduced blurring), allowing it to guide the iterative joint-optimization both improves the search convergence and renders the joint-optimization separable. This enables rapid mitigation within shots in addition to between shots. For 2D in-plane motion correction experiments, the result is a significant reduction of both image space root mean square error in simulations, and a reduction of motion artifacts in the in vivo motion tests.

In addition to involuntary physiological motion such as respiration and cardiac motion, intended and accidental patient movements can occur. Any impairment by motion artifacts can reduce the reliability and precision of the diagnosis and a motion-free reacquisition can become time-and cost-intensive. Numerous motion correction strategies have been proposed to reduce or prevent motion artifacts. These methods have in common that they need to be applied during the actual measurement procedure with a-priori knowledge about the expected motion type and appearance. For retrospective motion correction and without the existence of any a-priori knowledge, this problem is still challenging.
Methods: We propose the use of deep learning frameworks to perform retrospective motion correction in a reference-free setting by learning from pairs of motion-free and motion-affected images. For this image-to-image translation problem, we propose and compare a variational auto encoder and generative adversarial network. Feasibility and influences of motion type and optimal architecture are investigated by blinded subjective image quality assessment and by quantitative image similarity metrics.
Results: We observed that generative adversarial network-based motion correction is feasible producing near-realistic motion-free images as confirmed by blinded subjective image quality assessment. Generative adversarial network-based motion correction accordingly resulted in images with high evaluation metrics (normalized root mean squared error <0.08, structural similarity index >0.8, normalized mutual information >0.9).
Conclusion: Deep learning-based retrospective restoration of motion artifacts is feasible resulting in near-realistic motion-free images. However, the image translation task can alter or hide anatomical features and, therefore, the clinical applicability of this technique has to be evaluated in future studies.","deep learning,generative adversarial network,motion correction,variational auto encoder",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,ARTIFACTS,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,,

NNs offer the potential for providing a novel solution to the problem of image compression by its ability to generate an internal data representation. A comparison among various feed-forward back-propagation training algorithms was presented with different compression ratios and different block sizes.

The proposed hybrid model takes segmental behaviour of heart sound signal into account by combining two different deep learning methods, the Static and the Moving Time-Growing Neural Network, which we call STGNN and MTGNN, respectively. Flexibility of the model in learning both deterministic and stochastic segments of signal allows it to learn those complicated characteristics of heart sound signal caused by any obstruction on semilunar heart valve. The model is trained to distinguish between a patient group and a reference group. The patient group is comprised of the subjects with the semilunar heart valve abnormalities including aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis and bicuspid aortic valve, whereas the reference group which is composed of the individuals with the heart abnormalities other than those of the reference group or the healthy ones. The model is validated using two different databases: one comprised of 140 children with various heart conditions, and the other one constituted of 50 elderly patients with aortic stenosis. Both the datasets were collected from the referrals to the University hospitals. The overall accuracy and sensitivity of the model are estimated to be 84.2% and 82.8%, respectively.

It was found from the literature that successful results were obtained by using the feature extraction methods that are sensitive to local changes such as one-dimensional local binary patterns (1D-LBP). In 1D-LBP, the local changes in a signal were determined based on the comparisons between each ""central value'' with its neighbors. In order to increase the sensitivity of extracted features from the local changes in a signal, each ""value'' in the signal was compared with its neighbor, and by this way, a motif was obtained in the result of the comparisons in a specified window. To evaluate and validate the proposed approach, the non-EEG bio-signals, which were recorded by electrodermal activity, temperature, accelerometer, heart rate, and arterial oxygen level sensors, were employed. The features that were extracted from these signals by the proposed motif patterns were classified by machine learning methods. The neurological status of each of the samples was classified accurately by the proposed approach. Furthermore, the optimal sensor types were investigated and it was found that heart rate signals are enough to estimate the neurological status. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to be an effective neuroimaging technique for detecting SNHL. However, manual detection methods, mainly based on the visual inspection of MRI, are cumbersome, time-consuming and need skilled supervision. Hence, there is a great need to design a computer-aided detection system for fast, accurate and automated detection of SNHL. This paper presents a new method for automated diagnosis of SNHL through brain MR images. Fast discrete curvelet transform is employed for image decomposition. The features are extracted from various decomposed subbands at different scales and orientations. A set of discriminant features is then derived using PCA+LDA algorithm. A hybrid classifier is suggested by integrating extreme learning machine and Jaya optimization with mutation (MJaya-ELM) to distinguish hearing loss images from healthy MR images. The proposed hybrid method overcomes the drawbacks of traditional ELM and other learning algorithms for single layer feedforward neural network. The concept of mutation is introduced to conventional Jaya optimization (MJaya) for improving the global search ability of the solutions by providing additional diversity. The proposed system is evaluated on a well-studied database. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of overall accuracy and sensitivity over different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed MJaya-ELM algorithm is also compared with its counterparts such as PSO-ELM, DE-ELM, and Jaya-ELM, and the results indicate the superiority of MJaya-ELM.

Multiclass classification of brain MR images is comparatively more challenging and has great clinical significance. Hence, it has recently become an active area of research in biomedical image processing. In this paper, an automated multiclass brain MR classification framework is proposed to categorize the MR images into five classes such as brain stroke, degenerative disease, infectious disease, brain tumor, and normal brain. A texture based feature descriptor is proposed using curvelet transform and Tsallis entropy to extract salient features from MR images. The potential of Tsallis entropy features is compared with Shannon entropy features. A kernel extension of random vector functional link network (KRVFL) is used to perform multiclass classification and improve the generalization performance at faster training speed. To validate the proposed method, two standard multiclass brain MR datasets (MD-1 and MD-2) are used. The proposed system obtained classification accuracies of 97.33% and 94.00% for MD-1 and MD-2 datasets respectively using 5-fold cross validation approach.

However, breast cancer classification is challenging due to numerous morphological and textural variations that appeared in intra-class images. Also, the direct processing of high resolution histological images is uneconomical in terms of GPU memory. In the present study, we have proposed a new approach for breast histopathological image classification that uses a deep convolution neural network (CNN) with wavelet decomposed images. The original microscopic image patches of 2048 x 1536 x 3 pixels are decomposed into 512 x 384 x 3 using 2-level Haar wavelet and subsequently used in proposed CNN model. The image decomposition step considerably reduces convolution time in deep CNNs and computational resources, without any performance downgrade. The CNN model extracts the deep features from Haar wavelet decomposed images and incorporates multi-scale discriminant features for precise prognostication of class labels. This paper also solves the demand for massive histopathology dataset by means of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. The efficacy of proposed approach is corroborated on two publicly available breast histology datasets-(a) one provided as a part of international conference on image analysis and recognition (ICIAR 2018) grand challenge and (b) on BreakHis data. On the ICIAR 2018 validation data, our model showed an accuracy of 98.2% for both 4-class and 2-class recognition.

However, the morphological differentiation among different types of normal and abnormal peripheral blood cells is a difficult task that requires experience and skills. Therefore, the paper proposes a system for the automatic classification of eight groups of peripheral blood cells with high accuracy by means of a transfer learning approach using convolutional neural networks. With this new approach, it is not necessary to implement image segmentation, the feature extraction becomes automatic and existing models can be fine-tuned to obtain specific classifiers.
Methods: A dataset of 17,092 images of eight classes of normal peripheral blood cells was acquired using the CellaVision DM96 analyzer. All images were identified by pathologists as the ground truth to train a model to classify different cell types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (myelocytes, metamyelocytes and promyelocytes), erythroblasts and platelets. Two designs were performed based on two architectures of convolutional neural networks, Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3. In the first case, the networks were used as feature extractors and these features were used to train a support vector machine classifier. In the second case, the same networks were fine-tuned with our dataset to obtain two end-to-end models for classification of the eight classes of blood cells.
Results: In the first case, the experimental test accuracies obtained were 86% and 90% when extracting features with Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. On the other hand, in the fine-tuning experiment, global accuracy values of 96% and 95% were obtained using Vgg-16 and Inceptionv3, respectively. All the models were trained and tested using Keras and Tensorflow with a Nvidia Titan XP Graphics Processing Unit.
Conclusions: The main contribution of this paper is a classification scheme involving a convolutional neural network trained to discriminate among eight classes of cells circulating in peripheral blood. Starting from a state-of-the-art general architecture, we have established a fine-tuning procedure to develop an end-to-end classifier trained using a dataset with over 17,0 0 0 cell images obtained from clinical practice.

Delineating the ribs and clavicles is helpful for suppressing them from chest radiographs so that their effects can be reduced for chest radiography analysis. However, delineating ribs and clavicles automatically is difficult by methods without deep learning models. Moreover, few of methods without deep learning models can delineate the anterior ribs effectively due to their faint rib edges in the posterior-anterior (PA) CXRs.
Methods: In this work, we present an effective deep learning method for delineating posterior ribs, anterior ribs and clavicles automatically using a fully convolutional DenseNet (FC-DenseNet) as pixel classifier. We consider a pixel-weighted loss function to mitigate the uncertainty issue during manually delineating for robust prediction.
Results: We conduct a comparative analysis with two other fully convolutional networks for edge detection and the state-of-the-art method without deep learning models. The proposed method significantly outperforms these methods in terms of quantitative evaluation metrics and visual perception. The average recall, precision and F-measure are 0.773 +/- 0.030, 0.861 +/- 0.043 and 0.814 +/- 0.023 respectively, and the mean boundary distance (MBD) is 0.855 +/- 0.642 pixels of the proposed method on the test dataset.

Conclusions: The proposed model uses 3D rCNN filters to extract low- and high-level spatial features and to achieve promising performance. This is a potentially effective model for predicting objective toxicity for supporting clinical decision making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Methods and Materials: The study population consisted of 506 patients with prostate cancer collected from a clinically annotated database. After applying exclusion criteria, 342 patients were included in the final analysis. CT-based radiomics features were extracted from planning CT scans for prostate gland-only structure, and machine learning was used to train models for Gleason score (GS) and risk group (RG) classifications. Repeated cross-validation was used. The discriminatory performance of the developed models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis.
Results: Classifiers using CT-based radiomics features distinguished between GS <= 6 versus GS >= 7 with AUC = 0.90 and GS 7(3 + 4) versus GS 7(4 + 3) with AUC = 0.98. Developed classifiers also showed excellent performance in distinguishing low versus high RG (AUC = 0.96) and low versus intermediate RG (AUC = 1.00), but poorer performance was observed for GS 7 versus GS > 7 (AUC = 0.69). An overall modest performance was observed for validation on holdout data sets with the highest AUC of 0.75 for classifiers of low versus high RG and an AUC of 0.70 for GS 7 versus GS > 7.
Conclusions: Our results show that radiomics features from routinely acquired planning CT scans could provide insights into prostate cancer aggressiveness in a noninvasive manner. Assessing models on training data sets, the classifiers were especially accurate in discerning high-risk from low-risk patients and in classifying GS 7 versus GS > 7 and GS 7(3 + 4) versus G 7(4 + 3); however, classifiers were less adept at distinguishing high RG versus intermediate RG. External validation and prospective studies are warranted to verify the presented findings. These findings could potentially guide targeted radiation therapy strategies in radical intent radiation therapy for prostate cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we propose a novel recurrent fully convolutional network architecture for tracking such instance segmentations over time, which is highly relevant, e.g., in biomedical applications involving cell growth and migration. Our network architecture incorporates convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRU) into a stacked hourglass network to utilize temporal information, e.g., from microscopy videos. Moreover, we train our network with a novel embedding loss based on cosine similarities, such that the network predicts unique embeddings for every instance throughout videos, even in the presence of dynamic structural changes due to mitosis of cells. To create the final tracked instance segmentations, the pixel-wise embeddings are clustered among subsequent video frames by using the mean shift algorithm. After showing the performance of the instance segmentation on a static in-house dataset of muscle fibers from H&E-stained microscopy images, we also evaluate our proposed recurrent stacked hourglass network regarding instance segmentation and tracking performance on six datasets from the ISBI celltracking challenge, where it delivers state-of-the-art results.
