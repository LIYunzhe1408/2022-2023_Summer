In optical networks, a design margin is generally included in a QoT estimation tool (Qtool) to account for modeling and parameter inaccuracies, ensuring the acceptable performance. In this article, we use monitoring information from an operating network combined with supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to understand the network conditions. In particular, we model the penalties generated due to i) Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) gain ripple effect, and ii) filter spectral shape uncertainties at Reconfigurable Optical Add and Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) nodes. Enhancing the Qtool with the proposed ML regression models yields estimates for new or reconfigured connections that account for these two effects, resulting in more accurate QoT estimation and a reduced design margin. We initially propose two supervised ML regression models, implemented with Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), to estimate the individual penalties of the two effects and then a combined model. On Deutsche Telekom (DT) network topology with 12 nodes and 40 bidirectional links, we achieve a design margin reduction of similar to 1 dB for new connection requests.","Estimation,Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers,Optical fiber networks,Signal to noise ratio,Uncertainty,Optical fiber filters,Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA),filter cascading,machine learning,network margins,parameter uncertainties,quality of transmission (QoT)",Article; Proceedings Paper,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Optics,Telecommunications",,,"MITIGATION,DESIGN",JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY,https://zenodo.org/record/3979381/files/Modeling%20EDFA%20Gain%20Ripple%20and%20Filter.pdf,

However, 2PM often suffers from poor image quality because of various noise factors, including blur, white noise, and photo bleaching. In addition, the effectiveness of the existing image processing methods is limited because of the special features of 2PM images such as deeper tissue penetration but higher image noises owing to rapid laser scanning. To address the denoising problems in 2PM 3D images, we present a new algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed model consists of multiple U-nets in which an individual U-net removes noises at different scales and then yields a performance improvement based on a coarse-to-fine strategy. Moreover, the constituent CNNs employ fully 3D convolution operations. Such an architecture enables the proposed model to facilitate end-to-end learning without any pre/post processing. Based on the experiments on 2PM image denoising, we observed that our new algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over other baseline methods. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present a novel calibration-free strategy to enhance the performance of Bayesian optimization with preference learning. The entire learning process is solely based on pairwise comparison of quantities (i.e., higher or lower) in the same dataset, and experimental design can be done without comparing quantities in different datasets. We demonstrate that Bayesian optimization is significantly enhanced via data integration for organic molecules and inorganic solid-state materials.

Globally, almost half of the people under the age of 70 gets severely affected by diabetes. In the absence of earlier recognition and proper medication, the DR patients tend to lose their vision. When the warning signs are tracked down, the severity level of the disease has to be validated so to take decisions regarding appropriate treatment further. The current research paper focuses on the concept of classification of DR fundus images on the basis of severity level using a deep learning model. This paper proposes a deep learning-based automated detection and classification model for fundus DR images. The proposed method involves various processes namely preprocessing, segmentation and classification. The methods begins with preprocessing stage in which unnecessary noise that exists in the edges is removed. Next, histogram-based segmentation takes place to extract the useful regions from the image. Then, Synergic Deep Learning (SDL) model was applied to classify the DR fundus images to various severity levels. The justification for the presented SDL model was carried out on Messidor DR dataset.

Image synthesis has been widely accepted as a cost effective way to learn models because it provides training sets that are large, diverse and accurately labeled. However, the realism of the synthetic image is not enough, this affects generalization on naturalistic test image. In an attempt to address this issue, previous methods learn a model to improve the realism of synthetic image. Different from previous methods, we take the first step towards purifying the real image to weaken the influence of light and convert the distribution of an outdoor naturalistic image through a real-time style transfer task to that of indoor synthetic image. In this paper, we first introduce the segmentation masks to construct Red, Green, and Blue-mask (RGB-mask) pairs as inputs, then we design an attention-guided style transfer network to learn style features separately from the attention and background regions, learn content features from full and attention regions. Moreover, we propose a novel region-level task-guided loss to restrain the features learnt from style and content. Experiments were performed using a mixed research (qualitative and quantitative) method to demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions.

An important task in patient stratification is to discover quite distinct disease subtypes for effective treatment. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning and clustering model which combines Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Fuzzy C-Means(FCM), called Unsupervised Deep Fuzzy C-Means clustering Network(UDFCMN), to cluster lung cancer patients from lung CT images. In our deep clustering network, images after preprocessing are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables to extract hierarchical features and feature distribution and form the high-level representations. Here, to solve the problem of feature homogenization in DBN, we introduce the Winner-Take-All (WTA) idea to meliorate the traditional DBN structure, called WTADBN. Then FCM is used to produce the initial cluster labels with the new representations learnt by stacked WTARBM. Therefore, the FCM-generated cluster labels are used for the fine-tuning of the DBN as ground-truth labels. And an unsupervised image clustering and patient stratification process is completed by cross iteration. We tested our deep FCM clustering algorithm to do experiment on both public dataset from the internet and private dataset from cooperate hospital. For the latter one, the clinical and biological verification was also performed.

Methods: The presented method involves a factor disentangling sequential autoencoder (f-SAE) - realized in both long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks - to learn to disentangle the inter-subject variations from the factor relating to the location of origin of VT. To perform such disentanglement, a pair-wise contrastive loss is introduced. Results: The presented methods are evaluated on ECG dataset with 1012 distinct pacing sites collected from scar-related VT patients during routine pace-mapping procedures. Experiments demonstrate that, for classifying the origin of VT into the predefined segments, the presented f-SAE improves the classification accuracy by 8.94% from using prescribed QRS features, by 1.5% from the supervised deep CNN network, and 5.15% from the standard SAE without factor disentanglement.

Further, several skip connections are introduced to focus on learning only the unknown part of ICC.

One of the well recognized grand challenges in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image processing is to obtain intra-operative medical imaging datasets for network training and validation, but availability and quality of these datasets are scarce. Our novel training framework does not require ground-truth image pairs. Instead, it learns purely from computer-generated simulation images. This approach opens up new avenues and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning based methods and which requiring prior knowledge gained from extensive training datasets. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we have developed a novel generative-collaborative learning scheme that decomposes the de-smoke process into two separate tasks: smoke detection and smoke removal. The detection network is used as prior knowledge, and also as a loss function to maximize its support for training of the smoke removal network. Quantitative and qualitative studies show that the proposed training framework outperforms the state-of-the-art de-smoking approaches including the latest GAN framework (such as PIX2PIX).

In this paper, instead of separately employing the Gabor magnitude and phase features, which, respectively, reflect the intensity and variation of surface materials in local area, a cascade superpixel regularized Gabor feature fusion (CSRGFF) approach has been proposed. First, the Gabor filters with particular orientation are utilized to obtain Gabor features (including magnitude and phase) from the original hyperspectral image. Second, a support vector machine (SVM)-based probability representation strategy is developed to fully exploit the decision information in SVM output, and the achieved confidence score can make the following fusion with Gabor phase more effective. Meanwhile, the quadrant bit coding and Hamming distance metric are applied to encode the Gabor phase features and measure sample similarity in sequence. Third, the carefully defined characteristics of two kinds of features are directly combined together without any weighting operation to describe the weight of samples belonging to each class. Finally, a series of superpixel graphs extracted from the raw hyperspectral image with different numbers of superpixels are employed to successively regularize the weighting cube from over-segmentation to under-segmentation, and the classification performance gradually improves with the decrease in the number of superpixels in the regularization procedure. Four widely used real hyperspectral images have been conducted, and the experimental results constantly demonstrate the superiority of our CSRGFF approach over several state-of-the-art methods.","Hyperspectral imaging,Feature extraction,Transforms,Image analysis,Machine learning,Learning systems,Cascade superpixel regularization (SR),feature fusion,hyperspectral image classification,image segmentation",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,10.746,"SPATIAL,CLASSIFICATION,REPRESENTATION,INFORMATION,FRAMEWORK,PROFILES",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS,,

The diagnosis of the disease is made by the physician in two stages by examining the patient records taken with the polysomnography device. Because of the negative aspects of this process, new diagnostic processes and devices are needed. In this article, a new approach to sleep staging, which is one of the diagnostic steps of the disease, was proposed. An artificial intelligence-based sleep/awake system detection was developed for sleep staging processing. Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and heart rate variable (HRV) were used in the study. PPG records taken from patient and control groups were cleaned by the digital filter. The HRV parameter was then derived from the PPG signal. Then, 40 features from HRV signal and 46 features from PPG signal were extracted. The extracted features were classified by reduced machine learning techniques with F-score feature selection method. In order to evaluate the performances of the classifiers, the sensitivity and specificity values, the accuracy rates for each class were computed in the test set and receiver operating characteristic curve prepared. In addition, area under the curve (AUC), Kappa coefficient and F-score were calculated. According to the results obtained, the system can be realised with 91.09% accuracy rate using 11 PPG and HRV and with 90.01% accuracy rate using 14 HRV features. These success rates are quite enough for the system to work. When all these values are taken into consideration, it is possible to realise a practical sleep/awake detection system. This article suggests that the PPG signal can be used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea by processing with artificial intelligence and signal processing techniques.","electrocardiography,signal classification,learning (artificial intelligence),medical signal processing,feature extraction,medical disorders,neurophysiology,diseases,patient monitoring,photoplethysmography,sleep,hybrid artificial intelligence,obstructive sleep apnea,respiratory arrest,sleep quality,patient records,polysomnography device,diagnostic processes,sleep staging processing,heart rate,PPG records,HRV parameter,PPG signal,HRV signal,reduced machine,F-score feature selection method,receiver operating characteristic curve,HRV features,signal processing techniques",Article,"INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET, MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND",Engineering,,1.965,"EMPIRICAL,MODE,DECOMPOSITION,HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,EEG,SIGNALS,SLEEP-APNEA,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,NEURAL-NETWORK,ECG,SYSTEM,CLASSIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION",IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY,https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1049/iet-smt.2019.0034,

Some symptoms of DED include blurring of vision, crusting of eyelids, and irritation to the eyes. An array of clinical methods, such as Schirmer's test, is used to classify DED. Yet, these approaches are often invasive, need to be performed manually by clinicians, and/or they do not have reproducible results. They are also prone to interobserver variation among clinicians. Thus, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are preferred for DED diagnosis. This paper reviews the existing CAD techniques used to automatically diagnose DED, and focuses on the benefits of thermographic CAD systems. CAD systems for DED using thermography are found to be highly sensitive, specific, accurate, minimally invasive, convenient, and satisfactory. Also, deep learning techniques are discussed to precede conventional machine learning techniques in the development of a CAD system. It is concluded that the use of thermographic CAD systems coupled with a deep learning technique is likely to be useful for DED assessment in future work.","Computer-aided detection system,Dry eye disease,Infrared thermography,Machine learning,Deep learning",Review,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,2.581,"RATE-VARIABILITY,SIGNALS,OCULAR,SURFACE,TEAR,FILM,INFRARED,THERMOGRAPHY,LIPID,LAYER,SYSTEM,DISEASE,IDENTIFICATION,CLASSIFICATION,FEATURES",INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY,,

Mitochondrial protection is an effective way against CH. Rheum palmatum L. (rhubarb) has been used to treat chronic heart diseases such as heart failure, especially to inhibit cardiac compensatory enlargement. The aim of this study was to explore the pharmacodynamic component of rhubarb and reveal its pharmacological effects and targets in the treatment of CH. Based on network pharmacology and machine learning approach, ingredients of rhubarb and targets for CH were extracted and surflex docking was conducted for obtaining the optimal ingredient-target combination(s) and emodin-SIRT3 was identified for further functional analysis. Transverse aortic constriction or isoproterenol induced CH mice and phenylephrine injured cardiomyocytes were used to verify the mitochondria protection effect and CH improvement of emodin in vivo and in vitro by modulation of mitochondrial SIRT3 signaling. The results showed that emodin could block agonist-induced and pressure overload-mediated CH. Emodin prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and its underlying mechanism was attributed to the activation of SIRT3, but the effect was not obvious with the presence of SIRT3 inhibitors (3-TYP)/SIRT3 siRNA. Furthermore, PGC-1a was involved in the process of emodin regulating SIRT3 signaling pathway as an upstream target. Our findings clarified the main material basis and mechanism of rhubarb in the treatment of CH.

Most people in developed parts of the world rely on highly energy-intensive, and inefficient central heating/cooling systems to achieve thermophysiological comfort which is rarely satisfactory. A potential solution to this issue is a wearable personal thermal comfort system (PTCS) consisting of textile-based temperature and moisture sensors, thermal and moisture responsive actuators, and/or heating/cooling devices, that can sense the environment and physiology of the wearer, and accordingly provide an individualized thermal environment. Moving thermal regulation away from the built environment to the microclimate surrounding the human body using textiles has the potential to provide personalized thermal comfort and energy savings. Such a system may employ thermal comfort models and leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) to understand individuals' comfort requirements. Herein, the current state of textile-based active and passive comfort systems/technologies are summarized, including their environmental impact, major thermal comfort models, and factors influencing comfort.

We propose the mixed observability Markov decision process models for tasks which infer information about the state of a child based on observations of child's behavior. In order to formulate observation probabilities of task models, ASD experts are surveyed and their knowledge is encoded in the observation probabilities of task models. Expert knowledge also allowed for implementation of child behavioral models which are used to validate and tune developed models. Following the successful validation through simulations of child-robot interaction using child behavioral models, task models are validated through experimental sessions with six typically developing children and eight children with ASD.

Most of the research done so far is related to the process development including tool design, material weldability, post-weld mechanical behavior, and microstructural properties. More recently, in-line process monitoring and artificial intelligence algorithms are introduced into this process, but mainly to specific material configuration and joint thicknesses. This study will focus on the evaluation of different machine learning approaches including principle component analysis, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, single vector machine, and random forest methods on a friction stir welding cell environment. The input variables provided from this cell environment are namely divided into two groups: one group refers to the application variables and the other group is related to the friction stir welding process variables. The application variables target the aluminum alloys, joint configuration, sheet thicknesses, initial mechanical properties, and their chemical composition. The friction stir welding process variables dictate the rotational speed, travel speed, forging force, longitudinal and transverse forces, torque, and specific energy. The output response to model from these machine learning algorithms is the defect index, which has been quantified using high-resolution immersed bath ultrasounds. This nondestructive evaluation technique has been described previously, which can detect defects >= 150 mu m in thin sheets. The defect index has been classified into five classes, which is distinguished by the nature of defect, cold weld, or hot weld, as well as the width of the internal volumetric defect upon ultrasound C-scan result. The dataset, which is composed of around 500 various process conditions, has been generated over the last few years and the variables were taken exclusively in constant weld regime and in the force control mode using the output average values. This paper compares the best resulting machine learning methods applied on a friction stir welding cell basis, which is the K-nearest neighbor and multilayer perceptron algorithms. The K-nearest neighbor model reaches a deviation of 0.55 on the defect index in comparison with the experimental values, which is slightly better than the multilayer perceptron model, which obtains a score of 0.69. Over the initial 59 available model parameters, 10 and 15 of them were retained in the final algorithm using these techniques. The main predictors include the material thickness, base material ultimate tensile stress, rotational speed, travel speed, weld forces, and specific energy. The K-nearest neighbor model was able to provide a map of defect indices with regard to rotational speed and travel speed but was only possible when a higher density of data was found within the prediction area. A data density score was also included within the model to inform the end-user about the prediction reliability. The machine learning models are mainly about differentiating various cases rather than representing the physical phenomena as determined using the finite element analysis. That being said, in order to improve the prediction reliability as well as the machine learning models, the data twinning concept, which consists of generating simulated friction stir welding process conditions by finite element analysis, is briefly discussed.","Machine learning,Industry 4,0,friction stir welding,defect index",Article; Proceedings Paper,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,2.19,"TOOL,TORQUE,ROTATION,SYSTEM",PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS,,

There is considerable disagreement among prior studies in identifying predictors of radiation esophagitis. We apply machine learning algorithms to identify factors contributing to the development of radiation esophagitis to uncover previously unidentified criteria and more robust dosimetric factors.
Materials and Methods: We used machine learning approaches to identify predictors of grade >= 3 radiation esophagitis in a cohort of 202 consecutive locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation from 2008 to 2016. We evaluated 35 clinical features per patient grouped into risk factors, comorbidities, imaging, stage, histology, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and dosimetry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a panel of 11 machine learning algorithms combined with predictive power assessments.
Results: All patients were treated to a median dose of 66.6 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction using photon (89.6%) and proton (10.4%) beam therapy, most often with concurrent chemotherapy (86.6%). 11.4% of patients developed grade >= 3 radiation esophagitis. On univariate analysis, no individual feature was found to predict radiation esophagitis (AUC range 0.45-0.55, p >= 0.07). In multivariate analysis, all machine learning algorithms exhibited poor predictive performance (AUC range 0.46-0.56, p >= 0.07).
Conclusions: Contemporary machine learning algorithms applied to our modern, relatively large institutional cohort could not identify any reliable predictors of grade >= 3 radiation esophagitis. Additional patients are needed, and novel patient-specific and treatment characteristics should be investigated to develop clinically meaningful methods to mitigate this survival altering toxicity.

The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing.

In this paper, a new method combining local mean decomposition (LMD) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for seizure prediction. Firstly, the LMD is employed to decompose the raw EEG signals into a string of product functions (PFs). Subsequently, three PFs (PF2-PF4) are selected to learn the EEG features automatically using the deep CNN. In order to obtain the most important information from the features extracted by the CNN, the principal components analysis is applied to remove the redundant features. After that, these features are fed into the Bayesian linear discriminant analysis for classifying the cerebral state as interictal or preictal. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 87.7% with the false prediction rate of 0.25/h using intracranial EEG signals of 21 patients from a publicly available EEG dataset.

Machine learning has shown effectiveness in high throughput search of materials and nanostructures, but using it to discover exceptions has been out of the norm. Here we demonstrate the use of genetic algorithm to discover unexpected thermal conductivity enhancement in disordered nanoporous graphene as compared to periodic nanoporous graphene. Recent studies have concluded that random pores in nanoporous graphene lead to reduced thermal conductivity than periodic pores, due to phonon Anderson localization. This work, however, aims to challenge this accepted knowledge by searching for exceptions. A manual search was first shown to be expensive and unsuccessful. An efficient ""two-step"" search process coupled with genetic algorithm was then designed, and unexpected thermal conductivity enhancement was successfully discovered in certain structures with random pores, at a fraction of the computational cost of the manual search. Through structural analysis, we proposed that such unusual enhancement is due to the effect of shape factor and channel factor dominating over that of the phonon localization. Our work not only provides insights in thermal transport in disordered materials but also demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning to discover small probability events and the intriguing physics behind.","Porous graphene,Disorder,Thermal conductivity,Machine learning,Optimization",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,17.631,"THERMOELECTRIC,PROPERTIES,INSULATION,CAPABILITY,HEAT-TRANSFER,PHONON,GRAPHENE,OPTIMIZATION,LOCALIZATION,TEMPERATURE,MODEL,SI",NANO ENERGY,,

These tools provide an analysis of physical, chemical, or isotopic characteristics of the seized material to identify its origin. In this study, a novel technique that characterizes physical attributes is proposed to provide insight into the processing route of unknown uranium ore concentrates (UOCs) and their calcination products. In particular, this study focuses on the characteristics of the surface structure captured in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images at different magnification levels. Twelve common commercial processing routes of UOCs and their calcination products are investigated. Multiple-input single-output (MISO) convolution neural networks (CNNs) are implemented to differentiate the processing routes. The proposed technique can determine the processing route of a given sample in under a second running on a graphics processing unit (GPU) with an accuracy of more than 95%. The accuracy and speed of this proposed technique enable nuclear scientists to provide the preliminary identification results of interdicted material in a short time period. Furthermore, this proposed technique uses a predetermined set of magnifications, which in turn eliminates the human bias in selecting the magnification during the image acquisition process.

Traditionally researchers have focused on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data as the neural signals of interest for decoding visual scenes. However, our visual perception operates in a fast time scale of millisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike. There are few studies of decoding by using spikes. Here we fulfill this aim by developing a novel decoding framework based on deep neural networks, named spike-image decoder (SID), for reconstructing natural visual scenes, including static images and dynamic videos, from experimentally recorded spikes of a population of retinal ganglion cells. The SID is an end-to-end decoder with one end as neural spikes and the other end as images, which can be trained directly such that visual scenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly accurate fashion. Our SID also outperforms on the reconstruction of visual stimulus compared to existing fMRI decoding models. In addition, with the aid of a spike encoder, we show that SID can be generalized to arbitrary visual scenes by using the image datasets of MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore, with a pre-trained SID, one can decode any dynamic videos to achieve real-time encoding and decoding of visual scenes by spikes. Altogether, our results shed new light on neuromorphic computing for artificial visual systems, such as event-based visual cameras and visual neuroprostheses. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although pain activates the body's protective mechanism, some excessive pain reactions will damage the nearby biological tissues, and mostly it will bring people severe mental distress. In particular, some individuals with cognitive impairment, like the infants, are unable to describe their own pain, and thereby the disease will be delayed. These types of pain require intervention and relief and sudden pain belongs to one of them. Therefore, this paper proposes on a method of sudden pain recognition based on resting state EEG signals. This method can recognize the presence of sudden pain, distinguish the location of pain and can be effectively applied to disease diagnosis. The platform of sudden pain stimulation and EEG acquisition system was designed and built, and a series of experiments were carried out for different subjects. We preprocessed the raw EEG signals and extracted features via Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). We also utilized the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Sparse Bayesian Extreme Learning Machine (SBELM) and D-S Evidence Theory to do classification, utilizing 10-Fold Cross-validation.

Visual scoring of all-night recordings has inter-scorer variability which may lead to subjective results. Hence, we aimed to develop a novel automated method to detect arousals from two electroencephalographic channels in terms of the synchronic events of the right and left hemispheres.
Methods: In the context of the occurrence of arousal pattern, the relationship between two synchronic C3-A2 and C4-A1 channels were quantified using by coherence spectrum and mutual information. The power and the ratio values of the sub-bands of the coherence spectrum were selected as the five features. Furthermore, the mutual information value was determined as the sixth feature. The automatic detection performance was evaluated using six features and machine learning techniques, on five different patients' whole-night electroencephalography recordings. The presented method does not include any signal conditioning, pre-processing steps, any manual involvement, meta-rule-based approaches, and some empirical thresholds.
Results: The significant increases were found in sub-bands of the coherence spectrum in case of arousal. Moreover, the mutual information of these channels was distinctive during the arousal state. Consequently, the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV values were achieved as 99.5 %, 99.8 %, 99.6 %, and 99.3 %, respectively with using ensemble bagged tree.
Conclusion: The novelty of the present study is the practical determination of the relationship between electroencephalographic synchronization and the occurrence of the arousals between the central regions of the right and left hemispheres.

Several efforts are made to improve the performance of these devices in gestures recognition applications, especially in feature selection. It is necessary choose one approach for feature selection due to the great number of electromyography features available to use. In this work, an extensive comparison of feature reduction techniques and their influences in the classification process is presented. Unlike other works, we presents the comparison between methods of feature selection and classification; this main contribution is show how the feature reduction process can aid and increase the performance of classification of sEMG in armband acquisition approach. Two general methods were employed, feature selection by wrapper forward stepwise and dimensionality reduction, resulting in eight different techniques. The following dimensionality reduction techniques were used: Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Isomap, Manifold Charting, Autoencoder, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, and Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN). Seven classifiers were used, aiming at recognize six gestures acquired from an 8-channel armband of 13 subjects.

However, when performed by dermatologists, the results of clinical segmentation are affected by a certain margin of inaccuracy (which exists since dermatologist do not delineate lesions for segmentation but for extraction) and also significant inter- and intra-individual variability, such segmentation is not sufficiently accurate for segmentation studies. This work addresses these limitations to enable detailed analysis of lesions' geometry along with extraction of non-linear characteristics of region-of-interest border lines. A comprehensive review of 39 segmentation methods is carried out and a contribution to improve dermoscopic image segmentation is presented to determine the regions-ofinterest of skin lesions, through accurate border lines with fine geometric details. This approach resorts to Local Binary Patterns and k-means clustering for precise identification of lesions boundaries, particularly the melanocytic. A comparative evaluation study is carried out using three different datasets and reviewed algorithms are grouped according to their approach. Results show that algorithms from the same group tend to perform similarly. Nevertheless, their performance does not depend uniquely on the algorithm itself but also on the underlying dataset characteristics. Throughout several evaluations, the proposed Local Binary Patterns method presents, consistently, better average performance than the current state-of-the-art techniques across the three different datasets without the need of training or supervised learning steps. Overall, apart from presenting a new segmentation method capable of outperforming the current state-of-the-art, this paper provides insightful information about the behaviour and performance of different image segmentation algorithms.

However, these materials have highly variable compositions, and this strongly influences their chemical-looping performance. Here, using machine learning techniques, we estimate the performance of heterogeneous, multi-component materials as oxygen carriers for chemical-looping. Experimental data for 19 manganese ores chosen as potential chemical-looping oxygen carriers were used to create a so-called training database. This database has been used to train several supervised artificial neural network models (ANN), which were used to predict the reactivity of the oxygen carriers with different fuels and the oxygen transfer capacity with only the knowledge of reactor bed temperature, elemental composition, and mechanical properties of the manganese ores. This novel approach explores ways of dealing with the training dataset, learning algorithms and topology of ANN models to achieve enhanced prediction precision. Stacked neural networks with a bootstrap resampling technique have been applied to achieve high precision and robustness on new input data, and the confidence intervals were used to assess the precision of these predictions. The current results indicate that the best trained ANNs can produce highly accurate predictions for both the training database and the unseen data with the high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.94) and low mean absolute error (MAE = 0.057). We envision that the application of these ANNs and other machine learning algorithms will accelerate the development of oxygen carrying materials for a range of chemical-looping applications and offer a rapid screening tool for new potential oxygen carriers.","Machine learning,Artificial neural network,Manganese ores,Oxygen-carrier materials,Chemical-looping",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,11.529,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,COMBUSTION,CLC,CARBON,CAPTURE,ENERGY-SYSTEMS,SMALL,DATASET,PREDICTION,SCALE,ILMENITE,PRODUCTS,BIOMASS",CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL,https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=273197/0A98FBEE-0BC6-44FD-9286-EE6681F95EED.pdf&pub_id=273197,

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, 5707 subjects (3777 married; mean age: 61.9 +/- 5.1 y and 1930 unmarried; mean age: 61.9 +/- 5.3 y) underwent low-dose CT as part of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The median follow-up time was 6.5 (Q1-Q3: 5.6 to 6.9) years. Being unmarried was defined as never married, widowed, separated, or divorced. Being married was defined as married or living as married. Our primary endpoint was cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related death; our secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Coronary CT imaging biomarkers (calcium score, density, and volume) on low-dose chest CT scan were calculated using dedicated automatic software. Weighted Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to examine the association between marital status and death. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to visualize subject survival. Results: Being unmarried was significantly associated with an increased risk for CVD-related death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-1.91) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.26-1.53), which remained significant even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (HR CVD death: 1.75; 1.44-2.12 and HR all-cause mortality: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.43-1.74) and coronary calcium score (HR CVD death: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.31-1.91 and HR all-cause mortality: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.27-1.54).

As a very meaningful attempt about the idea, a bionic model of olfactory neural system, KIII model, is introduced in this paper. There are the unique characteristics of KIII model different from those of general ANNs. The KIII model realistically simulates the structure of the real olfactory neural system and the process of odor molecules gradually transformed by the core components of the olfactory system including olfactory receptor, olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. The neuron model of the KIII model is constructed and optimized based on neurophysiological experimental data and accurately reflects the response of olfactory neurons to odor stimulation. In particular, the noise introduced to KIII model can further improve the performance of the model. In addition, the KIII model is analyzed based on the idea of deep learning. The qualitative analysis shows that there are obvious similarities between the KIII model and the deep learning model. Furthermore, with the epileptic electroencephalograph (EEG) recognition task, two groups of experiments are designed to comprehensively analyze the performance of the KIII model. In the first group of experiments, a typical pattern recognition experiment with feature extraction stage is shown. The features of epileptic EEG were extracted based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and the KIII model was used as a classifier. The experimental results show that the KIII model only needs a small number of iterations to memorize different modes and has a high recognition rate, over 91%.

The agglomeration process is usually monitored using a camera. As pellet size distribution is one of the major measures of product quality monitoring, pellets detection and segmentation from the image are the key steps to determine the pellet size. Traditional image processing algorithms are not only challenged by the complicated constitution of pellets, sediment and residuals in the image, but also by the harsh and unbalanced light reflection on the pellet centrum area and the background which results in tedious parameter adjustment work and pool performance. To solve these problems, we design a lightweight U-net deep learning network to automatically detect pellets from images and to obtain the probability maps of pellet contours. Compared to classic U-net, the proposed network has fewer parameters and introduces batch normalization layers, which greatly reduces the computing time and improves generalization ability of the network. A concentric circle model is then used to separate clumped contours of the pellets, and the pellets shapes are detected via ellipse fitting. The proposed method is verified using images captured from an industrial pelletizing disk, and its performance is compared with traditional methods and the classic U-net. Results show that the proposed method achieves better segmentation performance in DICE and ROC indexes and shows good robustness to uneven illumination. Tests on temporal image sequences demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in monitoring the pellet size distribution and the pellet shape as well.

Experimental approaches are based on physical intuition and/or expensive trial and error strategies. Most computational methods rely on the availability of sufficient experimental data and computational power. Machine learning (ML) applied to materials science can accelerate development and reduce costs. In this study, we propose an ML method, leveraging thermodynamic and compositional attributes of a given material for predicting the synthesizability (i.e., entropy-forming ability) of disordered metal carbides. The relative importance of the thermodynamic and compositional features for the predictions are then explored. The approach's suitability is demonstrated by comparing values calculated with density functional theory to ML predictions. Finally, the model is employed to predict the entropy-forming ability of 70 new compositions; several predictions are validated by additional density functional theory calculations and experimental synthesis, corroborating the effectiveness in exploring vast compositional spaces in a high-throughput manner. Importantly, seven compositions are selected specifically, because they contain all three of the Group VI elements (Cr, Mo, and W), which do not form room temperature-stable rock-salt monocarbides. Incorporating the Group VI elements into the rock-salt structure provides further opportunity for tuning the electronic structure and potentially material performance.","TRANSITION-METAL,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,SCIENCE,DESIGN,ALLOY,CLASSIFICATION,STABILITY",Article,"NATURE PORTFOLIO, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"TRANSITION-METAL,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,SCIENCE,DESIGN,ALLOY,CLASSIFICATION,STABILITY",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://escholarship.org/content/qt34n8m7m0/qt34n8m7m0.pdf?t=qaxqg7,

This approach is the first event-based tactile sensor which utilizes the recent technology of neuromorphic cameras. This novel approach provides higher sensitivity, a lower latency, and less computational and power consumption compared to other conventional vision-based techniques. Moreover, the dynamic vision sensor (DVS) has a higher dynamic range which increases the sensor sensitivity and performance in poor lighting conditions. Two time-series machine learning methods, namely, time delay neural network (TDNN) and Gaussian process (GP) are developed to estimate the contact force in a grasp. A deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to classify the object materials. Forty-eight experiments are conducted for four different materials to validate the proposed methods and compare them against a piezoresistive force sensor measurements. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique is implemented to evaluate and analyze the performance of the proposed machine learning methods. The contact force is successfully estimated with a mean squared error of 0.16 and 0.17 N for TDNN and GP, respectively.

The composite control device is composed of a variable friction unit that contains four rectangular PZT actuators and an SMA unit that includes energy-dissipation and resettable wires. The friction force can be adjusted in real time by applying the voltage to the PZT actuators and the SMA wires can dissipate energy via hysteresis and provide a reset force. This composite control device's different components participate in energy dissipation at different seismic intensities. Electro-mechanical tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the SPCCD with different displacement amplitudes, loading/unloading frequencies, and excitation voltages. Correspondingly, the force-displacement curves are acquired, and the influences of the lap hysteretic energy dissipation, equivalent stiffness, and equivalent damping ratio on the energy dissipation capacity of the SPCCD are analyzed. Then, the excitation voltage and loading history are considered as neuronal input to establish a back-propagation (BP) neural network model of the SPCCD. The experimental results show that the hysteresis curves of the SPCCD are approximately symmetrical and the loading/unloading frequency has little effect on the mechanical properties. The maximum control force of the SPCCD linearly increases with an increase in the excitation voltage, and its semiactive PZT unit has a large adjustable range for energy dissipation. Thus, the SPCCD is reasonably designed. Moreover, the BP network constitutive model is able to accurately track the output of the SPCCD, providing an effective means for the establishment and application of the constitutive model to SMA-based composite control devices.","Shape memory alloy,Piezoelectric ceramic,Electro-mechanical test,Neural network,Constitutive model",Article,"ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Materials Science",,3.501,"DAMPER,MODEL",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,,

Despite the existence of many works on boosting the classification accuracy using a particular feature selection (FS) method, choosing the best one from a large pool of existing FS techniques for boosting feature reproducibility within a dataset of interest remains a formidable challenge to tackle. Notably, a good performance of a particular FS method does not necessarily imply that the experiment is reproducible and that the features identified are optimal for the entirety of the samples. Essentially, this paper presents the first attempt to address the following challenge: ""Given a set of different feature selection methods {FS1,...,FSK}, and a dataset of interest, how to identify the most reproducible and 'trustworthy' connectomic features that would produce reliable biomarkers capable of accurately differentiate between two specific conditions?"" To this aim, we propose FS-Select framework which explores the relationships among the different FS methods using a multi-graph architecture based on feature reproducibility power, average accuracy, and feature stability of each FS method. By extracting the 'central' graph node, we identify the most reliable and reproducible FS method for the target brain state classification task along with the most discriminative features fingerprinting these brain states. To evaluate the reproducibility power of FS-Select, we perturbed the training set by using different cross-validation strategies on a multi-view small-scale connectomic dataset (late mild cognitive impairment vs Alzheimer's disease) and large-scale dataset including autistic vs healthy subjects. Our experiments revealed reproducible connectional features fingerprinting disordered brain states. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It is often associated with fractures and severe pain. Previous studies have shown a high correlation between the density of the bone in the hip and in the mandibular bone in the jaw. This suggests that dental radiographs might be useful for detecting osteoporosis. Use of dental radiographs for this purpose would simplify early detection of osteoporosis. However, dental radiographs are not normally examined by radiologists. This paper explores the use of 13 different feature extractors for detection of reduced bone density in dental radiographs.
Methods: The computed feature vectors are then processed with a Self-Organizing Map and Learning Vector Quantization as well as Support Vector Machines to produce a set of 26 predictive models.
Results: The results show that the models based on Self-Organizing Map and Learning Vector Quantization using Gabor Filter, Edge Orientation Histogram, Haar Wavelet, and Steerable Filter feature extractors outperform the rest of the 22 models in detecting osteoporosis. The proposed Gabor-based algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6%, a sensitivity of 97.1%, and a specificity of 86.4%.
Conclusions: The oriented edges and textures in the upper and lower jaw regions are useful for distinguishing normal patients from patients with osteoporosis.

Recently, machine learning interaction potentials have gained much more attentions as they can provide density functional theory level predictions within negligible time. The symmetry function descriptor based atomistic neural network is the most widely used model for modeling alloys. To precisely describe complex potential energy surfaces, integrating advanced metrics, such as force or virial stress, into training can be of great help. In this work, we propose a virtual-atom approach to model the total energy of symmetry function descriptors based atomistic neural network. Our approach creates the computation graph directly from atomic positions. Thus, the derivations of forces and virial can be handled by TensorFlow automatically and efficiently. The virtual atom approach with AutoGrad within TensorFlow allows for efficient training to not just energies and forces, but also virial stress.

It provides information about charge state and local geometry around atoms of interest in operando and extreme conditions. However, in contrast to X-ray diffraction, a quantitative analysis of XANES spectra is rarely performed in the research papers. The reason must be found in the larger amount of time required for the calculation of a single spectrum compared to a diffractogram. For such time-consuming calculations, in the space of several structural parameters, we developed an interpolation approach proposed originally by Smolentsev and Soldatov (2007). The current version of this software, named PyFitIt, is a major upgrade version of FitIt and it is based on machine learning algorithms. We have chosen Jupyter Notebook framework to be friendly for users and at the same time being available for remastering. The analytical work is divided into two steps. First, the series of experimental spectra are analyzed statistically and decomposed into principal components. Second, pure spectral profiles, recovered by principal components, are fitted by theoretical interpolated spectra. We implemented different schemes of choice of nodes for approximation and learning algorithms including Gradient Boosting of Random Trees, Radial Basis Functions and Neural Networks. The fitting procedure can be performed both for a XANES spectrum or for a difference spectrum, thus minimizing the systematic errors of theoretical simulations. The problem of several local minima is addressed in the framework of direct and indirect approaches.

Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3.
Programming language: Python, Jupyter Notebook framework.
Nature of problem: Quantitative structural refinements of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra (XANES). Identification of the pure spectral and concentration profiles associated with an experimental XANES dataset.
Solution method: The fitting procedure of the experimental XANES spectra or of their differences is realized by means of the inverse and direct approaches based on the training set and approximation machine learning algorithms.

Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient's health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels.

For this purpose, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to estimate high dynamic range (HDR) illumination from a single RGB image of a reference object. To obtain illumination of a current scene, previous approaches inserted a special camera in that scene, which may interfere with user's immersion, or they analyzed reflected radiances from a passive light probe with a specific type of materials or a known shape. The proposed method does not require any additional gadgets or strong prior cues, and aims to predict illumination from a single image of an observed object with a wide range of homogeneous materials and shapes. To effectively solve this ill-posed inverse rendering problem, three sequential deep neural networks are employed based on a physically-inspired design. These networks perform end-to-end regression to gradually decrease dependency on the material and shape. To cover various conditions, the proposed networks are trained on a large synthetic dataset generated by physically-based rendering. Finally, the reconstructed HDR illumination enables realistic image-based lighting of virtual objects in MR.

The principal effects that are used for data fusion are shown theoretically. Their effectiveness is tested in case studies carried out on large-scale concrete specimens with built-in chloride-induced rebar corrosion. The dataset consists of half-cell potential mapping, Wenner resistivity, microwave moisture and ground penetrating radar measurements. Data fusion is based on the logistic regression algorithm. It learns an optimal linear decision boundary from multivariate labeled training data, to separate intact and defect areas. The training data are generated in an experiment that simulates the entire life cycle of chloride-exposed concrete building parts. The unique possibility to monitor the deterioration, and targeted corrosion initiation, allows data labeling. The results exhibit an improved sensitivity of the data fusion with logistic regression compared to the best individual method half-cell potential.","Data fusion,Concrete,Pitting corrosion,Half-cell potential mapping,Machine learning",Review,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Geochemistry & Geophysics,,6.457,"NDE,DATA,FUSION,CONCRETE,STEEL,POLARIZATION",SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS,,

We show that it's possible to train ML models to predict materials performance based on SEM images alone, demonstrating this capability on the real-world problem of predicting uniaxially compressed peak stress of consolidated molecular solids samples. Our image-based ML approach reduces mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by an average of 24% over baselines representative of the current state-of-the-practice (i.e., domain-expert's analysis and correlation). We compared two complementary approaches to this problem: (1) a traditional ML approach, random forest (RF), using state-of-the-art computer vision features and (2) an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach, where features are learned automatically from raw images. We demonstrate the complementarity of these approaches, showing that RF performs best in the ""small data"" regime in which many real-world scientific applications reside (up to 24% lower RMSE than DL), whereas DL outpaces RF in the ""big data"" regime, where abundant training samples are available (up to 24% lower RMSE than RF).

Despite great successes, few of them consider the human-robot integration and individual differences between users. Additionally, the design periods, cost and safety also need to be further improved. Learning from the natural driving mechanism of human body, we propose a general human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization designing approach for this kind of wearable robots. Firstly, the human-robot coupling model of the personalized wearable robot and the human musculoskeletal model are established. Then, the Computed Muscle Control (CMC) tool embedded in software OpenSim and the Bayesian optimization used in machine learning are combined to find the optimal design scheme for the personalized wearable robots to reduce the human metabolic energy cost in specific physical movement. The HIL approach could not only optimize the control parameters of wearable robots, but also optimize their geometry, material and any other design parameters flexibly and effectively. An application example for the HIL approach is also provided to help designers better understand and use the HIL method proposed in this paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The inherent hierarchical relations among physical quantities and state variables in an elasto-plasticity model are first represented as informed, directed graphs, where three variations of the graph are tested. While feed-forward neural networks are used to train path-independent constitutive relations (e.g., elasticity), recurrent neural networks are used to replicate responses that depends on the deformation history, i.e. or path dependent. In dealing with the objectivity deficiency, we use the spectral form to represent tensors and, subsequently, three metrics, the Euclidean distance between the Euler Angles, the distance from the identity matrix, and geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra, can be employed to constitute objective functions for the supervised machine learning. In this, the aim is to minimize the measured distance between the true and the predicted 3D rotation entities. Following this, we conduct numerical experiments on how these metrics, which are theoretically equivalent, may lead to differences in the efficiency of the supervised machine learning as well as the accuracy and robustness of the resultant models. Neural network models trained with tensors represented in component form for a given Cartesian coordinate system are used as a benchmark. Our numerical tests show that, even given the same amount of information and data, the quality of the anisotropic elasto-plasticity model is highly sensitive to the way tensors are represented and measured. The results reveal that using a loss function based on geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra together with an informed, directed graph yield significantly more accurate rotation prediction than the other tested approaches.

In order to tangibly illustrate this process, this work develops a framework for a specific model problem combining: (I) a meshless discrete element ""submodel"" that tracks the trajectory of airborne hot particles/embers, subject to prevailing wind velocities and updrafts, (II) a topographical ""submodel"" of the ambient combustible material whereby airborne embers that make contact are allowed to start secondary fires (if conditions are appropriate), combined with ground-based surface spread and burn rates for generating new embers, new updrafts (due to hot air), etc., and (III) a Machine-Learning Algorithm to rapidly ascertain the multi-submodel system parameters that force the overall model to match observations. The submodels compute both ground and airborne hot-ember driven fire propagation, as well as subsequent distribution of debris/soot, which is important for air-quality assessment.

Towards this goal, we report on a new paradigm for systematic segmentation of morphological features relevant to a given microstructure using an industrially relevant titanium alloy as an example. A two stage pipeline consisting of a classification step and a segmentation step is used to process titanium microstructures containing multiple morphological features and output quantitative measurements relevant to the particular class of microstructure identified. For the classification step, a Convolutional Neural Network is trained using the Keras API, with the architecture consisting of three convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. The microstructures are classified into three labels: ""lamellar"", ""duplex"", and ""acicular"". A material microstructure dataset of 1225 images is established, comprised of Ti-6Al-4V alloy micrographs acquired from seven different thermal processing conditions. The CNN was trained on a dataset of 1000 images and subsequently tested on a dataset of 225 images. It reported an accuracy of 93.00 +/- 1.17%, averaged over 5 trials incorporating a random division of the total dataset into training and test sets.

A novel, robust deep wavelet sparse autoencoder (DWSAE) method is presented and validated for fully automated EOG artifact removal. DWSAE takes advantage of wavelet transform and sparse autoencoder to become a universal EOG artifact corrector. After being trained without supervision, the sparse autoencoder performs EOG correction on time-frequency coefficients collected after brain wave signal wavelet decomposition. Corrected coefficients are then used for wavelet reconstruction of uncontaminated EEG signals. DWSAE is compared with five other methods: second-order blind identification, information maximization, joint approximation diagonalization of eigen-matrices, wavelet neural network (WNN) and wavelet thresholding (WT). Experimental results on a visual attention task dataset, a mental state recognition dataset and a semi-simulated contaminated EEG dataset show that DWSAE is capable of suppressing EOG artifacts effectively, while preserving the nature of background EEG signals. The mean square error of signals before and after correction by DWSAE on a semi-simulated contaminated EEG segment of 30 s is the lowest (65.62) when compared to the results produced by WNN and WT. DWSAE addresses limitations posed by these methods in three ways. First, DWSAE can be performed automatically and online in a single channel of EEG data; this has advantages over independent component analysis-based methods. Second, its results are robust and stable in comparison with those of other wavelet-based methods. Third, as an unsupervised learning scheme, DWSAE does not require the off-line training that is necessary for WNN and other supervised learning machine learning-based methods.","EEG,EOG artifact,Deep wavelet sparse autoencoder",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,"OCULAR,ARTIFACTS,EOG,ARTIFACTS,EEG,SEPARATION",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

The machine learning model built on imbalance dataset gives predictions biased toward majority class hence the model will always predict the case as no depression case even if it is a case of depression.

The interest in the field was sparked by the adjacent field of high-entropy and multi-component alloys, and the promise consists of both demonstrated properties and a possibly very large freedom for materials design. These promises, however, also come with new challenges connected to the vast available experimental space, which is inherent in multi-component materials. Traditional materials science methodologies will be slow to make appreciable progress in such an environment. A novel approach is needed to meet the challenges of the hyperdimensional compositional space. Recent developments within the fields of information technology can give materials science the tools needed. This Perspective article summarizes the state of the art in the field of multi-component nitride materials, focusing on coatings where solid solution phases with simple crystal structures are formed. Furthermore, it outlines the present research challenges that need to be addressed to move the field forward and suggests that there is a need to combine the traditional knowledge-driven materials science methodology with new data-driven methodologies. The latter would include advanced data-handling with artificial intelligence and machine learning to assist in the evaluation of large, shared datasets from both experimental and theoretical work.

This type of control is usually implemented by means of pattern recognition, which uses a set of training data to create a model that can decipher these muscular activations. A consequence of this approach is that the reliability of a myocontrol system depends on how representative this training data is for all types of signal variability that may be encountered when the amputee puts the prosthesis into real use. Myoelectric signals are indeed known to vary according to the position and orientation of the limb, among other factors, which is why it has become common practice to take this variability into account by acquiring training data in multiple body postures. To shed further light on this problem, we compare two ways of collecting data: while the subjects hold their limb statically in several positions one at a time, which is the traditional way, or while they dynamically move their limb at a constant pace through those same positions. Since our interest is to investigate any differences when controlling an actual prosthetic device, we defined an evaluation protocol that consisted of a series of complex, bimanual daily-living tasks. Fourteen intact participants performed these tasks while wearing prosthetic hands mounted on splints, which were controlled via either a statically or dynamically built myocontrol model. In both cases all subjects managed to complete all tasks and participants without previous experience in myoelectric control manifested a significant learning effect; moreover, there was no significant difference in the task completion times achieved with either model. When evaluated in a simulated scenario with traditional offline performance evaluation, on the other hand, the dynamically-trained system showed significantly better accuracy.

Firstly, the DeepLab-V3 + network was used to segment the original MRI abdominal image to obtain the uterine region image. Then, the uterine region image and the corresponding blood loss data were trained by Visual Geometry Group Network-16 (VGGNet-16) network. The classification model of blood loss level was obtained. Using a dataset of 82 positive samples and 128 negative samples, the proposed method achieved accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 75.61, 73.75, and 77.46% respectively. The experimental results showed that this method can not only automatically identify the uterine region of pregnant women, but also objectively determine the level of intraoperative bleeding. Therefore, this method has the potential to reduce the workload of the attending physician and improve the accuracy of experts' judgment on the level of bleeding during cesarean section, so as to select the corresponding hemostasis measures.","image recognition,deep learning,image segmentation,MRI uterus image,assistant diagnosis",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,,,FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7203465?pdf=render,

Prior deep-learning models that utilize real-valued kernels have limited capability to learn rich representations of complex MRI data. In this work, we utilize a complex-valued convolutional network (DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet) for fast reconstruction of highly under-sampled MRI data and evaluate its ability to rapidly reconstruct 3D late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) data. DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet preserves the complex nature and optimal combination of real and imaginary components of MRI data throughout the reconstruction process by utilizing complex-valued convolution, novel radial batch normalization, and complex activation function layers in a U-Net architecture. A prospectively under-sampled 3D LGE cardiac MRI dataset of 219 patients (17 003 images) at acceleration rates R = 3 through R = 5 was used to evaluate DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet. The dataset was further retrospectively under-sampled to a maximum of R = 8 to simulate higher acceleration rates. We created three reconstructions of the 3D LGE dataset using (1) DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet, (2) a compressed-sensing-based low-dimensional-structure self-learning and thresholding algorithm (LOST), and (3) a real-valued U-Net (realNet) with the same number of parameters as DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet. LOST-reconstructed data were considered the reference for training and evaluation of all models. The reconstructed images were quantitatively evaluated using mean-squared error (MSE) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and subjectively evaluated by three independent readers. Quantitatively, DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet-reconstructed images had significantly improved MSE and SSIM values compared with realNet (MSE, 0.077 versus 0.091; SSIM, 0.876 versus 0.733, respectively; p < 0.01). Subjective quality assessment showed that DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet-reconstructed image quality was similar to that of compressed sensing and significantly better than that of realNet. DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet reconstruction was also more than 300 times faster than compressed sensing. Retrospective under-sampled images demonstrate the potential of DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet at higher acceleration rates. DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL CNet enables fast reconstruction of highly accelerated 3D MRI with superior performance to real-valued networks, and achieves faster reconstruction than compressed sensing.","complex convolutional network,deep learning,image reconstruction,late gadolinium enhancement,MRI",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Biophysics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Spectroscopy",,3.988,"IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION,QUANTIFICATION,SENSE",NMR IN BIOMEDICINE,,

It is associated with high risks of fetal loss and perinatal death. Fetoscopic elective laser ablation (ELA) of placental anastomoses has been established as the most effective therapy for TTTS. Current tools and techniques face limitations in case of more complex ELA cases. Visualization of the entire placental surface and vascular equator; maintaining an adequate distance and a close to perpendicular angle between laser fiber and placental surface are central for the effectiveness of laser ablation and procedural success. Robot-assisted technology could address these challenges, offer enhanced dexterity and ultimately improve the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic procedures. Methods This work proposes a 'minimal' robotic TTTS approach whereby rather than deploying a massive and expensive robotic system, a compact instrument is 'robotised' and endowed with 'robotic' skills so that operators can quickly and efficiently use it. The work reports on automatic placental pose estimation in fetoscopic images. This estimator forms a key building block of a proposed shared-control approach for semi-autonomous fetoscopy. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict the relative orientation of the placental surface from a single monocular fetoscope camera image. To overcome the absence of real-life ground-truth placenta pose data, similar to other works in literature (Handa et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2016; Gaidon et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2016; Vercauteren et al. in: Proceedings of the IEEE, 2019) the network is trained with data generated in a simulated environment and an in-silico phantom model. A limited set of coarsely manually labeled samples from real interventions are added to the training dataset to improve domain adaptation. Results The trained network shows promising results on unseen samples from synthetic, phantom and in vivo patient data. The performance of the network for collaborative control purposes was evaluated in a virtual reality simulator in which the virtual flexible distal tip was autonomously controlled by the neural network. Conclusion Improved alignment was established compared to manual operation for this setting, demonstrating the feasibility to incorporate a CNN-based estimator in a real-time shared control scheme for fetoscopic applications.","Deep learning,Convolutional neural networks,Robot assisted surgery,Shared control,Orientation estimation,Fetoscopy",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,,"TWIN,TRANSFUSION,SYNDROME,LASER-SURGERY,MANIPULATOR",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11548-020-02166-3.pdf,

This approach is blinded to individual patient intraprostatic pathology, and unfortunately, has a high rate of false negatives. Methods In this paper, we propose a deep network for improved detection of prostate cancer in systematic biopsy. We address several challenges associated with training such network: (1) Statistical labels: Since biopsy core's pathology report only represents a statistical distribution of cancer within the core, we use multiple instance learning (MIL) networks to enable learning from ultrasound image regions associated with those data; (2) Limited labels: The number of biopsy cores are limited to at most 12 per patient. As a result, the number of samples available for training a deep network is limited. We alleviate this issue by effectively combining Independent Conditional Variational Auto Encoders (ICVAE) with MIL. We train ICVAE to learn label-invariant features of RF data, which is subsequently used to generate synthetic data for improved training of the MIL network. Results Our in vivo study includes data from 339 prostate biopsy cores of 70 patients. We achieve an area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 0.68, 0.77, 0.55 and 0.66, respectively. Conclusion The proposed approach is generic and can be applied to several other scenarios where unlabeled data and noisy labels in training samples are present.","Temporal enhanced ultrasound,Deep neural networks,Augmentation,Multiple instance learning,Systematic biopsy,Prostate cancer",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"ULTRASOUND,CANCER,DIAGNOSIS,FUSION,MRI",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

These properties are strongly influenced by crystal vibrations, but the exact relationship between them and the behavior of spin qubits is not fully investigated. We uncover the local vibrational modes of the Si vacancy spin qubits in as-grown 4H-SiC. We apply microwave-assisted spectroscopy to isolate the contribution from one particular type of defects, the so-called V2 center, and observe the zero-phonon line together with seven equally separated phonon replicas. Furthermore, we present first-principles calculations of the photoluminescence line shape, which are in excellent agreement with our experimental data. To boost up the calculation accuracy and decrease the computation time, we extract the force constants using machine-learning algorithms. This allows us to identify the dominant modes in the lattice vibrations coupled to an excited electron during optical emission in the Si vacancy. A resonance phonon energy of 36 meV and a Debye-Waller factor of about 6% are obtained. We establish experimentally that the activation energy of the optically induced spin polarization is given by the local vibrational energy. Our findings give insight into the coupling of electronic states to vibrational modes in SiC spin qubits, which is essential to predict their spin, optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. The approach described can be applied to a large variety of spin defects with spectrally overlapped contributions in SiC as well as in other three-and two-dimensional materials.","SILICON-CARBIDE,COHERENT CONTROL,DEFECT",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"SILICON-CARBIDE,COHERENT,CONTROL,DEFECT",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,https://research.aalto.fi/files/43083234/PhysRevB.101.144109.pdf,

Usually, such an approach relies on specific domain knowledge for feature design: each learning target requires careful selection of features that an expert recognizes as important for the specific task. The major drawback of this approach is that computation of only a few structural features has been implemented so far, and it is difficult to tell a priori which features are important for a particular application. The latter problem has been empirically observed for predictors of guest uptake in nanoporous materials: local and global porosity features become dominant descriptors at low and high pressures, respectively. We investigate a feature representation of materials using tools from topological data analysis. Specifically, we use persistent homology to describe the geometry of nanoporous materials at various scales. We combine our topological descriptor with traditional structural features and investigate the relative importance of each to the prediction tasks. We demonstrate an application of this feature representation by predicting methane adsorption in zeolites, for pressures in the range 1-200 bar. Our results not only show a considerable improvement compared to the baseline, but they also highlight that topological features capture information complementary to the structural features. This is especially important for the adsorption at low pressure, a task particularly difficult for the traditional features. Furthermore, by investigation of the importance of individual topological features in the adsorption model, we are able to pinpoint the location of the pores that correlate best to adsorption at different pressure, contributing to our atom-level understanding of structure-property relationships.","METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS,DIFFUSION,CO2",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"METAL-ORGANIC,FRAMEWORKS,DIFFUSION,CO2",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05972,

The aim of the present work was to develop a methodology for detecting such signs and to evaluate its generalizability and clinical specificity for detecting signs of depression and anxiety. Our approach focused on dynamic descriptors of facial expressions, employing motion history image, combined with appearance-based feature extraction algorithms (local binary patterns, histogram of oriented gradients), and visual geometry group features derived using deep learning networks through transfer learning. The relative performance of various alternative feature description and extraction techniques was first evaluated on a novel dataset comprising patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression (n=20\) and healthy volunteers (n=45). Among various schemes involving depression measures as outcomes, best performance was obtained for continuous assessment of depression severity (as opposed to binary classification of patients and healthy volunteers). Comparable performance was achieved on a benchmark dataset, the audio/visual emotion challenge (AVEC'14). Regarding clinical specificity, results indicated that the proposed methodology was more accurate in detecting visual signs associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms.

The membranes consist of three layers of material: a polyester backing layer, a polysulfone support and a polyamide (PA) thin film separating layer. It is generally thought that the PA layer controls ion selectivity within the membrane but little is understood about its structure or chemistry at the molecular scale. This active polyamide layer is synthesized by interfacial polymerization at an organic/aqueous interface between m-phenylenediamine and trimesoyl chloride, producing a highly cross-linked PA polymer. It has been speculated that the distribution of functional chemistry within this layer could play a role in solute filtration. The only technique potentially capable of probing the distribution of functional chemistry within the active PA layer with sufficient spatial and energy resolution is scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS). Its use is a challenge because organic materials suffer beam-induced damage at relatively modest electron doses. Here we show that it is possible to use the N K-edge to map the active layer of a PA film using monochromated EELS spectrum imaging. The active PA layer is 12 nm thick, which supports previous neutron reflectivity data. Clear changes in the fine structure of the C K-edge across the PA films are measured and we use machine learning to assign fine structure at this edge. Using this method, we map highly heterogeneous intensity variations in functional chemistry attributed to N-C=C bonds within the PA. Similarities are found with previous molecular dynamics simulations of PA showing regions with a higher density of amide bonding as a result of the aggregation process at similar length scales. The chemical pathways that can be deduced may offer a clearer understanding of the transport mechanisms through the membrane.","reverse osmosis membranes,electron energy-loss spectroscopy,nanoscale chemical mapping,water permeation pathway,water desalination",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"RADIATION-DAMAGE,ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY,LAYER,RO,SPECTROSCOPY,CHEMISTRY,STEM",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/78124,

By using a lens/fibre-optic scope, inserted into the amniotic cavity, the abnormal placental vascular anastomoses are identified and ablated to regulate blood flow to both fetuses. Limited field-of-view, occlusions due to fetus presence and low visibility make it difficult to identify all vascular anastomoses. Automatic computer-assisted techniques may provide better understanding of the anatomical structure during surgery for risk-free laser photocoagulation and may facilitate in improving mosaics from fetoscopic videos. Methods We propose FetNet, a combined convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture for the spatio-temporal identification of fetoscopic events. We adapt an existing CNN architecture for spatial feature extraction and integrated it with the LSTM network for end-to-end spatio-temporal inference. We introduce differential learning rates during the model training to effectively utilising the pre-trained CNN weights. This may support computer-assisted interventions (CAI) during fetoscopic laser photocoagulation. Results We perform quantitative evaluation of our method using 7 in vivo fetoscopic videos captured from different human TTTS cases. The total duration of these videos was 5551 s (138,780 frames). To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we perform 7-fold cross-validation where each video is treated as a hold-out or test set and training is performed using the remaining videos. Conclusion FetNet achieved superior performance compared to the existing CNN-based methods and provided improved inference because of the spatio-temporal information modelling. Online testing of FetNet, using a Tesla V100-DGXS-32GB GPU, achieved a frame rate of 114 fps.

Our study has shown that the integrated effect of the structural, hydrophobic and topological properties along with electronic property should be considered in order to design an efficient PEC catalytic approach for environmental applications.","ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATION,STRUCTURE-REACTIVITY,CHARGE-TRANSFER,TIO2,QSAR,DEGRADATION,VALIDATION,MODELS,PHOTOELECTROCATALYSIS,PHOTOCATALYSIS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,,"ELECTROCHEMICAL,OXIDATION,STRUCTURE-REACTIVITY,CHARGE-TRANSFER,TIO2,QSAR,DEGRADATION,VALIDATION,MODELS,PHOTOELECTROCATALYSIS,PHOTOCATALYSIS",PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

Therefore, it is considered by the physician as the essential tools and materials to diagnose and treat heart diseases. To deal with different types of arrhythmia, the physician manually inspects the ECG heartbeat. Since there are tiny alternations in the amplitude, durations and therefore the morphology, the computer-based systems were needed to develop such solutions in order to help the physician to do their job. In this study, a novel tactic to automatically classify ten different arrhythmia types was developed depending on the deep learning theory. Consequently, the well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) approach was adopted to classify those different types of arrhythmia. The structure of the proposed model consists of 11 layers distributed as follows: four layers as convolution interchanged with other four layers of max pooling and finally three successfully connected layers. The experiment was conducted with the dataset which was downloaded from the Physionet in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital database and then augmented to get sufficient and balanced dataset. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the previous algorithms, confusion matrix, sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), precision (PRE), area under curve and receiver operating characteristic have been used and calculated. It has been found that performance from the proposed method is better than the existing methods based on CNN, and the accuracy is 99.84.","CNN,Arrhythmia classification,ECG signal",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,1.998,"CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION,TRANSFORM,BEATS,MODEL,PCA",SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING,,

The main objective of database generation is to create a data set of childhood medulloblastoma samples since there exists no available benchmark data set. The proposed framework for automated classification is based on the architectural property and the distribution of cells. Five texture features were extracted for the feature set, namely: grey-level co-occurrence matrix, grey-level run length matrix, first-order histogram features, local binary pattern and Tamura features. The performance of each feature set was evaluated, both individually and in combinations, using five different classifiers. Fivefold cross-validation was used for training and testing the data set. Experiments on both individual feature sets and combinations (best-2, best-3, best-4 and all-5) of feature sets were evaluated based on the accuracy of performance. It was revealed that the combined best-4 feature set resulted in the highest accuracy of 91.3%. The precision, recall and specificity were 0.913, 0.913 and 0.97, respectively. Significantly, it implied that the all-5 feature set is not necessary to have a useful classification. Feature reduction by principal component analysis resulted in increased accuracy of 96.7%.
Lay description Childhood medulloblastoma is a case of childhood brain tumour that requires high attention due to a low survival rate. Effective prognosis depends a lot on accurate detection of its subtype. The present study proposes a texture-based computer-aided categorization of childhood medulloblastoma samples. According to the World Health Organization (W.H.O), it has four subtypes (desmoplastic, classic, nodular, and large). Classification is done in two levels: i) normal and abnormal ii) its four subtypes. The system is evaluated on indigenous patient samples collected from the region. The main objective of database generation is to create a data set of childhood medulloblastoma samples since there exists no available benchmark data set. The proposed framework is a model for the automatic classification of the samples. The tissue samples obtained post-operation by doctors are converted into images, and then necessary algorithms are applied so that certain features describing each group of the image are known and studied for classification. Later these images are classified using the image features into the subtypes of abnormal samples.","Classification,machine learning,medulloblastoma,PCA,subtype,texture",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Microscopy,,1.855,"CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM,TUMORS,BRAIN",JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY,,

Material topography is known to influence macrophage attachment and phenotype, providing opportunities for the rational design of ""immune-instructive"" topographies to modulate macrophage function and thus foreign body responses to biomaterials. However, no generalizable understanding of the inter-relationship between topography and cell response exists. A high throughput screening approach is therefore utilized to investigate the relationship between topography and human monocyte-derived macrophage attachment and phenotype, using a diverse library of 2176 micropatterns generated by an algorithm. This reveals that micropillars 5-10 mu m in diameter play a dominant role in driving macrophage attachment compared to the many other topographies screened, an observation that aligns with studies of the interaction of macrophages with particles. Combining the pillar size with the micropillar density is found to be key in modulation of cell phenotype from pro to anti-inflammatory states. Machine learning is used to successfully build a model that correlates cell attachment and phenotype with a selection of descriptors, illustrating that materials can potentially be designed to modulate inflammatory responses for future applications in the fight against foreign body rejection of medical devices.","biomaterials,high-throughput screening,immune-modulation,topography",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,17.835,"FOREIGN-BODY,RESPONSE,SURFACE-CHEMISTRY,BIOMATERIALS,SHAPE,PHAGOCYTOSIS,IMPLANTS,LIBRARY,RODENTS,BIOLOGY,IMPACT",ADVANCED SCIENCE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7284204?pdf=render,

In this study, the lithium diffusion pathways in a series of large-scale a-Si models (512 atoms) with various extents of structural order are calculated using the machine learning interatomic potential. Then, the Li diffusion behavior in different atomistic environments is estimated from the transient state theory. The Li diffusion activation energy is observed to be lower (higher) in an ordered (disordered) local environment. The activation energy varies within the range of 1.21-1.46 eV, which agrees well with experimental measurements, 1.38-1.46 eV. Our simulations also show that Li diffusion is enhanced at higher Li concentration, which is consistent with experimental observations. The effects of structural disorder and Li concentration can be explained by the ""trap"" mechanism. Finally, we show that the sources of Li diffusion traps are dangling bonds and large voids in the a-Si matrix with the help of first-principles calculations. Our work provides insight into the Li diffusion mechanism, which is beneficial for improving the performance of a-Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries. In addition, we demonstrate the significant dependence of the ion transport behavior on the local atomic environment, which will be useful for future theoretical studies of technologically important amorphous materials beyond Si.","LI-ION DIFFUSION,ELECTRODES,PSEUDOPOTENTIALS,POTENTIALS,INSERTION",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",Materials Science,,4.034,"LI-ION,DIFFUSION,ELECTRODES,PSEUDOPOTENTIALS,POTENTIALS,INSERTION",PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS,,

However, cell staining is not always allowed in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time-consuming or expensive to implement. Staining protocolsmay be operator-sensitive, and hence may lead to varying analytical results, as well as cause artificial imaging artifacts or false heterogeneity. We present a deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). After a training process, the deep neural network can take images of unseen sperm cells retrieved from holograms acquired without staining and convert them to their stainlike images. We obtained a fivefold recall improvement in the analysis results, demonstrating the advantage of using virtual staining for sperm cell analysis. With the introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical settings, the proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF procedures, as well as to significantly simplify and radically change other cell analyses and techniques such as imaging flow cytometry.","digital holography,deep learning,biological cell imaging",Article,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES, 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,12.291,"INTERFEROMETRIC,PHASE,MICROSCOPY",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196795,
