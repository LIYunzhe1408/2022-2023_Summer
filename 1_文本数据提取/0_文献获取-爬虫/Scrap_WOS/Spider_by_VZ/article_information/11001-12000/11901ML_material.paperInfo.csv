1,Optimization of Artificial Intelligence System by Evolutionary Algorithm for Prediction of Axial Capacity of Rectangular Concrete Filled Steel Tubes under Compression,13,5,,"Hung Quang Nguyen,Hai-Bang Ly,Van Quan Tran,Thuy-Anh Nguyen,Tien-Thinh Le,Binh Thai Pham","Nguyen HQ,Ly HB,Tran VQ,Nguyen TA,Le TT,Pham BT",Nguyen HQ,10.3390/ma13051205,Thuyloi University,"Concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs) show advantageous applications in the field of construction, especially for a high axial load capacity. The challenge in using such structure lies in the selection of many parameters constituting CFST, which necessitates defining complex relationships between the components and the corresponding properties. The axial capacity (P-u) of CFST is among the most important mechanical properties. In this study, the possibility of using a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict P-u was investigated. Furthermore, an evolutionary optimization algorithm, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), was used for tuning and optimizing the FNN weights and biases to construct a hybrid FNN-IWO model and improve its prediction performance. The results showed that the FNN-IWO algorithm is an excellent predictor of P-u, with a value of R-2 of up to 0.979. The advantage of FNN-IWO was also pointed out with the gains in accuracy of 47.9%, 49.2%, and 6.5% for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-2, respectively, compared with simulation using the single FNN. Finally, the performance in predicting the P-u in the function of structural parameters such as depth/width ratio, thickness of steel tube, yield stress of steel, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio was investigated and discussed.","axial capacity prediction,rectangular CFST columns,feedforward neural network,invasive weed optimization",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"NEURAL-NETWORK,APPROACH,CIRCULAR,CFT,COLUMNS,TUBULAR,COLUMNS,STUB,COLUMNS,EXPERIMENTAL,BEHAVIOR,FIRE,RESISTANCE,NUMERICAL-MODEL,SHEAR-STRENGTH,FAILURE,BEAMS",MATERIALS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7085075?pdf=render,
2,A Study on Establishing a Microstructure-Related Hardness Model with Precipitate Segmentation Using Deep Learning Method,13,5,,"Wang Chan,Shi Duoqi,Li Shaolin","Wang C,Shi DQ,Li SL",Shi DQ; Li SL,10.3390/ma13051256,Beihang University,"This paper established a microstructure-related hardness model of a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy GH4720Li, and the sizes and area fractions of gamma' precipitates were extracted from scanning electron microscope (SEM) images using a deep learning method. The common method used to obtain morphological parameters of gamma' precipitates is the thresholding method. However, this method is not suitable for distinguishing different generations of gamma' precipitates with similar gray values in SEM images, which needs many manual interventions. In this paper, we employ SEM with ATLAS (AuTomated Large Area Scanning) module to automatically and quickly detect a much wider range of microstructures. A deep learning method of U-Net is firstly applied to automatically and accurately segment different generations of gamma' precipitates and extract their parameters from the large-area SEM images. Then the obtained sizes and area fractions of gamma' precipitates are used to study the precipitate stability and microstructure-related hardness of GH4720Li alloy at long-term service temperatures. The experimental results show that primary and secondary gamma' precipitates show good stability under long-term service temperatures. Tertiary gamma' precipitates coarsen selectively, and their coarsening behavior can be predicted by the Lifshitz-Slyozov encounter modified (LSEM) model. The hardness decreases as a result of gamma' coarsening. A microstructure-related hardness model for correlating the hardness of the gamma'/gamma coherent structures and the microstructure is established, which can effectively predict the hardness of the alloy with different microstructures.","deep learning method,different generations of gamma' precipitates,large-area SEM images,gamma' coarsening,microstructure-related hardness model",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,NI-BASED,SUPERALLOY,HEAT-TREATMENT,COARSENING,KINETICS,GAMMA%27,MECHANISMS,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,MATRIX",MATERIALS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7085056,

Gliomas are highly heterogeneous tumors, and optimal treatment depends on identifying and locating the highest grade disease present. Imaging techniques for doing so are generally not validated against the histopathologic criterion standard. The purpose of this work was to estimate the local glioma grade using a machine learning model trained on preoperative image data and spatially specific tumor samples. The value of imaging in patients with brain tumor can be enhanced if pathologic data can be estimated from imaging input using predictive models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Patients with gliomas were enrolled in a prospective clinical imaging trial between 2013 and 2016. MR imaging was performed with anatomic, diffusion, permeability, and perfusion sequences, followed by image-guided stereotactic biopsy before resection. An imaging description was developed for each biopsy, and multiclass machine learning models were built to predict the World Health Organization grade. Models were assessed on classification accuracy, Cohen ?, precision, and recall.
RESULTS:
Twenty-three patients (with 7/9/7 grade II/III/IV gliomas) had analyzable imaging-pathologic pairs, yielding 52 biopsy sites. The random forest method was the best algorithm tested. Tumor grade was predicted at 96% accuracy (? = 0.93) using 4 inputs (T2, ADC, CBV, and transfer constant from dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging). By means of the conventional imaging only, the overall accuracy decreased (89% overall, ? = 0.79) and 43% of high-grade samples were misclassified as lower-grade disease.
CONCLUSIONS:
We found that local pathologic grade can be predicted with a high accuracy using clinical imaging data. Advanced imaging data improved this accuracy, adding value to conventional imaging. Confirmatory imaging trials are justified.","HISTOGRAM ANALYSIS,PERFUSION,GLIOBLASTOMA,SYSTEM,CLASSIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,ASTROCYTOMAS,PERMEABILITY,INFILTRATION,TUMORS",Review,"AMER SOC NEURORADIOLOGY, PO BOX 3000, DENVILLE, NJ 07834-9349 USA","Neurosciences & Neurology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.457,"HISTOGRAM,ANALYSIS,PERFUSION,GLIOBLASTOMA,SYSTEM,CLASSIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,ASTROCYTOMAS,PERMEABILITY,INFILTRATION,TUMORS",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/41/3/400.full.pdf,

Process parameters such as temperature, pressure and saturation vapor pressure were found to have a significant impact on the series of chemical reactions as well as on the formation and transformation of solid hydrates. During the stirring process of sand-lime mass, the temperature of the reaction between lime and water in the presence of quartz sand (QS) was determined to be 83 degrees C. In the presence of glass sand, measured temperature was only 42 degrees C. Thermodynamic equilibrium-based modelling was applied to predict stable phase assemblages in the studied systems. It was found that compositional modification along with the application of the autoclaving process resulted in the formation of two crystalline phases: natrolite and gyrolite. Compressive strength and density were also assessed. The strength of fresh laboratory samples was found to be greater than their traditional analogues by 15 MPa. In addition to experimental characterization, sand-lime materials were also modeled using neural networks (backpropagation neural network, BPNN) which serve as a universal approximation method capable of modelling complex functions.","sand,glass,calcium,autoclaving,thermodynamics,C-S-H,gyrolite,natrolite,M-S-H",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,2.703,"C-S-H,PORTLAND-CEMENT,HEAT-TRANSFER,CONVECTIONAL,ELEMENTS,AIR,MOVEMENT,SILICATE,CONCRETE,TOBERMORITE,SYSTEM,SLAG",BUILDINGS,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/10/3/41/pdf,

Embedded solutions are therefore required to monitor the insulation status.

For real-world speed measurement, inertial sensors or global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can be used on wrist, possibly integrated in a wristwatch. However, power consumption of GNSS is high and data are only available outdoor. Gait speed estimation using wrist-mounted inertial sensors is generally based on machine learning and suffers from low accuracy because of the inadequacy of using limited training data to build a general speed model that would be accurate for the whole population. To overcome this issue, a personalized model was proposed, which took unique gait style of each subject into account. Cadence and other biomechanically derived gait features were extracted from a wrist-mounted accelerometer and barometer. Gait features were fused with few GNSS data (sporadically sampled during gait) to calibrate the step length model of each subject through online learning. The proposed method was validated on 30 healthy subjects where it has achieved a median [Interquartile Range] of root mean square error of 0.05 [0.04-0.06] (m/s) and 0.14 [0.11-0.17] (m/s) for walking and running, respectively. Results demonstrated that the personalized model provided similar performance as GNSS. It used 50 times less training GNSS data than nonpersonalized method and achieved even better results. This parsimonious GNSS usage allowed extending battery life. The proposed algorithm met requirements for applications which need accurate, long, real-time, low-power, and indoor/outdoor speed estimation in daily life.","Global navigation satellite system,Sensors,Estimation,Wrist,Data models,Accelerometers,Legged locomotion,Low-power,online learning,personalization,real-world gait speed,running and walking",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,,"PARKINSONS-DISEASE,AMBULATORY,SYSTEM,WEARABLE,SENSORS,STRIDE,LENGTH,DAILY-LIFE,WALKING,CALIBRATION,PARAMETERS,VELOCITY,INCLINE",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/271574/files/Postprint.pdf,

In clinical practice, colposcopy is an indispensable part of screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades and cervical cancer but exhibits high misdiagnosis rate. Existing computer-assisted algorithms for analyzing cervigram images have neglected that colposcopy is a sequential and multistate process, which is unsuitable for clinical applications. In this work, we construct a cervigram-based recurrent convolutional neural network (C-RCNN) to classify different CIN grades and cervical cancer. Convolutional neural networks are leveraged to extract spatial features. We develop a sequence-encoding module to encode discriminative temporal features and a multistate-aware convolutional layer to integrate features from different states of cervigram images.

Our approach consists of two generative modules that synthesize images of the two modalities in a sequential order. A method for measuring the synthesis complexity is proposed to automatically determine the synthesis order in our sequential GAN. Images of the modality with a lower complexity are synthesized first, and the counterparts with a higher complexity are generated later. Our sequential GAN is trained end-to-end in a semi-supervised manner. In supervised training, the joint distribution of bi-modality images are learned from real paired images of the two modalities by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between the real and synthetic images. To avoid overfitting limited training images, in unsupervised training, the marginal distribution of each modality is learned based on unpaired images by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of real and fake images. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed model using two synthesis tasks based on three types of evaluate metrics and user studies.

A typical reconstruction method based on post-log measurements is called penalized weighted-least squares (PWLS). Due to the underlying limitations of the post-log statistical model, the PWLS reconstruction quality is often degraded in low-dose scans. This paper investigates a shifted-Poisson (SP) model based likelihood function that uses the pre-log raw measurements that better represents the measurement statistics, together with a data-driven regularizer exploiting a Union of Learned TRAnsforms (SPULTRA). Both the SP induced data-fidelity term and the regularizer in the proposed framework are nonconvex. The proposed SPULTRA algorithm uses quadratic surrogate functions for the SP induced data-fidelity term. Each iteration involves a quadratic subproblem for updating the image, and a sparse coding and clustering subproblem that has a closed-form solution. The SPULTRA algorithm has a similar computational cost per iteration as its recent counterpart PWLS-ULTRA that uses post-log measurements, and it provides better image reconstruction quality than PWLS-ULTRA, especially in low-dose scans.","Inverse problems,sparse representation,transform learning,shifted-Poisson model,nonconvex optimization,efficient algorithms,machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"ATTENUATION,CORRECTION,ITERATIVE,RECONSTRUCTION,SPARSIFYING,TRANSFORMS,CONVERGENCE,GUARANTEES,ULTRA,SIMULATION,LIKELIHOOD,EFFICIENT,3D,RESTORATION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170173,

A THz image can be represented by a data cube with each pixel containing a high-dimensional spectrum vector covering several THz frequencies, where each frequency represents a different dimension in the vector. The proposed algorithm projects the high-dimensional spectrum vector of each pixel within the THz image into a low-dimensional subspace that contains the majority of the unique features embedded in the image. The low-dimensional subspace is constructed by sequentially identifying its orthonormal basis vectors, such that each newly chosen basis vector represents the most unique information not contained by existing basis vectors. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to represent the statistical distributions of the low-dimensional feature vectors obtained from the proposed dimension reduction algorithm. The model parameters are iteratively learned by using unsupervised learning methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or expectation maximization, and the results are used to classify the various regions within a tumor sample. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves apparent performance improvement in human breast cancer tissue over existing approaches such as one-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo.

These materials are machined to create components that meet the dimensional and surface finish tolerance specifications for various industrial applications. The heterogeneous structure of these materials-resulting from different fiber orientations and their complex multiscale structure-introduces a distinct set of material removal mechanisms that inherently vary over time. This structure has an adverse effect on the surface integrity of machined NFRPs. Therefore, a real-time monitoring approach is desirable for timely intervention for quality assurance. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors that capture the elastic waves generated from the plastic deformation and fracture mechanisms have potential to characterize these abrupt variations in the material removal mechanisms. However, the relationship connecting AE waveform patterns with these NFRP material removal mechanisms is not currently understood. This paper reports an experimental investigation into how the time-frequency patterns of AE signals connote the various cutting mechanisms under different cutting speeds and fiber orientations. Extensive orthogonal cutting experiments on unidirectional flax fiber NFRP samples with various fiber orientations were conducted. The experimental setup was instrumented with a multisensor data acquisition system for synchronous collection of AE and vibration signals during NFRP cutting. A random forest machine learning approach was employed to quantitatively relate the AE energy over specific frequency bands to machining conditions and hence the process microdynamics, specifically, the phenomena of fiber fracture and debonding that are peculiar to NFRP machining. Results from this experimental study suggest that the AE energy over these frequency bands can correctly predict the cutting conditions to similar to 95% accuracies, as well as the underlying material removal regimes.","natural fiber reinforced composites,acoustic emission sensor,random forest,smart sensing and in-process monitoring",Article,"ASME, TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",Engineering,,3.084,"MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,INTERFACIAL,EVALUATION,MICROMECHANICAL,TEST,FRACTURE,MECHANISMS,FLANK,WEAR,GENERATION,STRENGTH,BEHAVIOR,SIGNALS,GLASS",JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/manufacturingscience/article-pdf/142/3/031003/6479804/manu_142_3_031003.pdf,

Today, just classifying the diseases is not enough. The system should also be able to classify a particular patient's disease. Thus, this paper shines the light on the importance of multi spectral classification which means the collection of several monochrome images of the same scene. It can be proved to be an important process in the healthcare areas to know if a patient is suffering from a specific disease or not.

Patients with extensive infarction are unlikely to benefit from thrombolysis or thrombectomy procedures.
Purpose: To develop an automated approach to detect and quantitate infarction by using non-contrast-enhanced CT scans in patients with AIS.
Materials and Methods: Non-contrast-enhanced CT images in patients with AIS (<6 hours from symptom onset to CT) who also underwent diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI within 1 hour after AIS were obtained from May 2004 to July 2009 and were included in this retrospective study. Ischemic lesions manually contoured on DW MRI scans were used as the reference standard. An automatic segmentation approach involving machine learning (ML) was developed to detect infarction. Randomly selected nonenhanced CT images from 157 patients with the lesion labels manually contoured on DW MRI scans were used to train and validate the ML model; the remaining 100 patients independent of the derivation cohort were used for testing. The ML algorithm was quantitatively compared with the reference standard (DW MRI) by using Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation.
Results: In 100 patients in the testing data set (median age, 69 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 59-76 years; 59 men), baseline non-contrast-enhanced CT was performed within a median time of 48 minutes from symptom onset (IQR, 27-93 minutes); baseline MRI was performed a median of 38 minutes (IQR, 24-48 minutes) later. The algorithm-detected lesion volume correlated with the reference standard of expert-contoured lesion volume in acute DW MRI scans (r = 0.76, P<.001). The mean difference between the algorithm-segmented volume (median, 15 mL; IQR, 9-38 mL) and the DW MRI volume (median, 19 mL; IQR, 5-43 mL) was 11 mL (P = .89).
Conclusion: A machine learning approach for segmentation of infarction on non-contrast-enhanced CT images in patients with acute ischemic stroke showed good agreement with stroke volume on diffusion-weighted MRI scans.

Traditional systems are not completely reliable because their minimum error rate is 1-2%, which can result in fruit loss, since the pitting process is not infallible, and food safety issues can arise. Such minimum errors are impossible to remove through mechanical adjustments. In order to achieve this objective, an innovative solution must be provided in order to remove errors at operating speed rates over 2500 olives/min. This work analyzes the appropriate placement of olives in the pockets of the feed chain by using the following items: (1) An IoT System to control the DRR machine and the data analysis. (2) A computer vision system with an external shot camera and a LED lighting system, which takes a picture of every pocket passing in front of the camera. (3) A chip with a neural network for classification that, once trained, classifies between four possible pocket cases: empty, normal, incorrectly de-stoned olives at any angles (also known as a ""boat""), and an anomalous case (foreign elements such as leafs, small branches or stones, two olives or small parts of olives in the same pocket). The main objective of this paper is to illustrate how with the use of a system based on IoT and a physical chip (NeuroMem CM1K, General Vision Inc.) with neural networks for sorting purposes, it is possible to optimize the functionality of this type of machine by remotely analyzing the data obtained.

For the scoring protocol, the U-Net was trained with 199 PDT hand-drawn images of 512 x 512 resolution obtained via the mPDT in order to generate a trained model, Deep5, for segmenting a drawn right or left pentagon. The U-Net was also trained with 199 images of 512 x 512 resolution to attain the trained model, DeepLock, for segmenting an interlocking figure. Here, the epochs were iterated until the accuracy was greater than 98% and saturated. The mobile senor data primarily consisted of x and y coordinates, timestamps, and touch-events of all the samples with a 20 ms sampling period. The velocities were then calculated using the primary sensor data. With Deep5, DeepLock, and the sensor data, four parameters were extracted. These included the number of angles (0-4 points), distance/intersection between the two drawn figures (0-4 points), closure/opening of the drawn figure contours (0-2 points), and tremors detected (0-1 points). The parameters gave a scaling of 11 points in total. The performance evaluation for the mPDT included 230 images from subjects and their associated sensor data. The results of the performance test indicated, respectively, a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of 97.53%, 92.62%, 94.35%, and 87.78% for the number of angles parameter; 93.10%, 97.90%, 96.09%, and 96.43% for the distance/intersection parameter; 94.03%, 90.63%, 92.61%, and 93.33% for the closure/opening parameter; and 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and 100.00% for the detected tremor parameter.

It is the foremost cause of the hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC. Detecting new key genes that play a role in the growth of HCC in HCV patients using machine learning techniques paves the way for producing accurate antivirals. In this work, there are two phases: detecting the up/downregulated genes using classical univariate and multivariate feature selection methods, and validating the retrieved list of genes using Insilico classifiers. However, the classification algorithms in the medical domain frequently suffer from a deficiency of training cases. Therefore, a deep neural network approach is proposed here to validate the significance of the retrieved genes in classifying the HCV-infected samples from the disinfected ones. The validation model is based on the artificial generation of new examples from the retrieved genes' expressions using sparse autoencoders. Subsequently, the generated genes' expressions data are used to train conventional classifiers. Our results in the first phase yielded a better retrieval of significant genes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a multivariate approach. The retrieved list of genes using PCA had a higher number of HCC biomarkers compared to the ones retrieved from the univariate methods.

The key function of red blood cells (erythrocytes) is to supply all the parts of the human body with oxygen. Red blood cells (RBCs) form a crescent or sickle shape when sickle cell anemia affects them. This abnormal shape makes it difficult for sickle cells to move through the bloodstream, hence decreasing the oxygen flow. The precise classification of RBCs is the first step toward accurate diagnosis, which aids in evaluating the danger level of sickle cell anemia. The manual classification methods of erythrocytes require immense time, and it is possible that errors may be made throughout the classification stage. Traditional computer-aided techniques, which have been employed for erythrocyte classification, are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies on the selected features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes, colors, and complex shapes. However, microscopy images of erythrocytes are very complex in shape with different sizes. To this end, this research proposes lightweight deep learning models that classify the erythrocytes into three classes: circular (normal), elongated (sickle cells), and other blood content. These models are different in the number of layers and learnable filters. The available datasets of red blood cells with sickle cell disease are very small for training deep learning models. Therefore, addressing the lack of training data is the main aim of this paper. To tackle this issue and optimize the performance, the transfer learning technique is utilized. Transfer learning does not significantly affect performance on medical image tasks when the source domain is completely different from the target domain. In some cases, it can degrade the performance. Hence, we have applied the same domain transfer learning, unlike other methods that used the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning. To minimize the overfitting effect, we have utilized several data augmentation techniques. Our model obtained state-of-the-art performance and outperformed the latest methods by achieving an accuracy of 99.54% with our model and 99.98% with our model plus a multiclass SVM classifier on the erythrocytesIDB dataset and 98.87% on the collected dataset.","red blood cells,erythrocytes,sickle cell anemia,deep learning,classification,transfer learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,2.408,,ELECTRONICS,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/204816/1/68559750.pdf,

To address this challenge and optimize the performance, we have utilized a transfer learning technique which is where the deep learning models train on a task, and then fine-tune the models for another task. We have employed transfer learning in two ways: Training our proposed model first on the same domain dataset, then on the target dataset, and training our model on a different domain dataset, then on the target dataset.

However, unless one learns pronunciation in childhood, it is almost impossible to reach a native-level accent. In this research, we take the difficulties of learning tonal pronunciation in Mandarin as an example and analyze the difficulties of tone learning and the deficiencies of general learning methods using the cognitive load theory. With the tasks designed commensurate with the learner's perception ability based on perception experiments and small-step learning, the perception training app is more effective for improving the tone pronunciation ability compared to existing apps with voice analysis function. Furthermore, the learning effect was greatly improved by optimizing the app interface and operation procedures. However, as a result of the combination of pronunciation practice and perception training, pronunciation practice with insufficient feedback could lead to pronunciation errors. Therefore, we also studied pronunciation practice using machine learning and aimed to train the model for the pronunciation task design instead of classification. We used voices designed as training data and trained a model for pronunciation training, and demonstrated that supporting pronunciation practice with machine learning is practicable.","language learning,pronunciation practice,perception training,teaching materials design,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Computer Science,,,PERCEPTION,FUTURE INTERNET,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/3/42/pdf,

Early diagnosis of lung nodules has great significance for the prevention of lung cancer. Despite major improvements in modern diagnosis and treatment, the five-year survival rate is only 18%. Before diagnosis, the classification of lung nodules is one important step, in particular, because automatic classification may help doctors with a valuable opinion. Although deep learning has shown improvement in the image classifications over traditional approaches, which focus on handcraft features, due to a large number of intra-class variational images and the inter-class similar images due to various imaging modalities, it remains challenging to classify lung nodule. In this paper, a multi-deep model (MD model) is proposed for lung nodule classification as well as to predict the image label class. This model is based on three phases that include multi-scale dilated convolutional blocks (MsDc), dual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN A/B), and multi-task learning component (MTLc). Initially, the multi-scale features are derived through the MsDc process by using different dilated rates to enlarge the respective area. This technique is applied to a pair of images. Such images are accepted by dual DCNNs, and both models can learn mutually from each other in order to enhance the model accuracy. To further improve the performance of the proposed model, the output from both DCNNs split into two portions. The multi-task learning part is used to evaluate whether the input image pair is in the same group or not and also helps to classify them between benign and malignant. Furthermore, it can provide positive guidance if there is an error. Both the intra-class and inter-class (variation and similarity) of a dataset itself increase the efficiency of single DCNN. The effectiveness of mentioned technique is tested empirically by using the popular Lung Image Consortium Database (LIDC) dataset. The results show that the strategy is highly efficient in the form of sensitivity of 90.67% specificity 90.80%, and accuracy of 90.73%.","Lung nodule classification,dilated blocks,dual DCNNs,multi-task learning,multi-deep model",Article,"SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD, 19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,,"NEURAL-NETWORK,SEGMENTATION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,,

These methods are based on machine learning algorithms applied to Acoustic Emission (AE) signals. The three friction states: dry (boundary), mixed, and fluid friction of journal bearings are classified by pre-processing the AE signals with windowing and high-pass filtering, extracting separation effective features from time, frequency, and time-frequency domain using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier. Furthermore, it is shown that journal bearing friction classification is not only possible under variable rotational speed and load, but also under different oil viscosities generated by varying oil inlet temperatures. A method used to identify the location of occurring mixed friction events over the journal bearing circumference is shown in this paper. The time-based AE signal is fused with the phase shift information of an incremental encoder to achieve an AE signal based on the angle domain. The possibility of monitoring the run-in wear of journal bearings is investigated by using the extracted separation effective AE features. Validation was done by tactile roughness measurements of the surface. There is an obvious AE feature change visible with increasing run-in wear. Furthermore, these investigations show also the opportunity to determine the friction intensity. Long-term wear investigations were done by carrying out long-term wear tests under constant rotational speeds, loads, and oil inlet temperatures. Roughness and roundness measurements were done in order to calculate the wear volume for validation. The integrated AE Root Mean Square (RMS) shows a good correlation with the journal bearing wear volume.","journal bearing,acoustic emission,machine learning,friction classification,friction localization,run-in wear,long-term wear",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,,,LUBRICANTS,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4442/8/3/29/pdf,

The finite element method (FEM) offers a great insight into fundamental principle and physical operation of the machine. It can model complex magnetic circuit topology, discrete windings layouts, and nonlinear magnetic material properties of the machine. It determines the machine parameters (such as the magnetic field distribution, flux density, electromagnetic torques, and stator current) and can model localized magnetic saturation due to faults to a high degree of accuracy. Used as fault detection algorithms, the FEM can address the issues such as the lack of comprehensive fault databases through field measurements, and the difficulty in distinguishing fault severity. It can reduce the number of destructive tests required in the field/labs, simulate any faulty states of the machine. Although FEM has been widely used in induction motors' design and analysis, its application in fault diagnosis is limited despite the promising potential. In this article, a literature review is conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis techniques using FEM. The state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature are categorized into three streams: first, FEM-based fault diagnosis approach, second, FEM and signal processing-based approach, and third, FEM, machine learning, and other advanced techniques-based approach.

We aimed to discover the spatial radiation dose-based (voxel dose) importance pattern in the major salivary glands in relation to the recovery of xerostomia 18 months after RT, and to compare the recovery voxel dose importance pattern to the acute incidence (injury) pattern.
Methods and Materials: This study included all patients within our database with xerostomia outcomes after completion of curative intensity modulated RT. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events xerostomia grade was used to define recovered versus nonrecovered group at baseline, between end of treatment and 18 months post-RT, and beyond 18 months, respectively. Ridge logistic regression was performed to predict the probability of xerostomia recovery. Voxel doses within geometrically defined parotid glands (PG) and submandibular glands (SMG), demographic characteristics, and clinical factors were included in the algorithm. We plotted the normalized learned weights on the 3-dimensional PG and SMG structures to visualize the voxel dose importance for predicting xerostomia recovery.
Results: A total of 146 head and neck cancer patients from 2008 to 2016 were identified. The superior region of the ipsilateral and contralateral PG was the most influencial for xerostomia recovery. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation for ridge logistic regression was 0.68 +/- 0.07. Compared with injury, the recovery voxel dose importance pattern was more symmetrical and was influenced by lower dose voxels.
Conclusions: The superior portion of the 2 PGs (low dose region) are the most influential on xerostomia recovery and seem to be equal in their contribution. The dissimilarity of the influence pattern between injury and recovery suggests different underlying mechanisms. The importance pattern identified by spatial radiation dose and machine learning methods can improve our understanding of normal tissue toxicities in RT. Further external validation is warranted.

The experimental tests were performed in two aluminum plates containing 18 defects with different depths and lengths. The 18 defects were inspected in the surface and sub-surface locations, resulting in a study of 36 different crack cases. The experimental data used to extract features for supervised machine learning were obtained using an eddy current testing (ECT) probe that includes a planar coil and a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor. The probe was excited by a multi-frequency signal with four testing frequencies to evaluate the dimensions and the locations of the defects. Due to the experimental noise existing in the measurement signals, it is important to pre-process the signals before feature extraction.

Most existing methods generally learn a network with global images as input. However, thorax diseases usually happen in (small) localized areas which are disease specific. Thus training CNNs using global images may be affected by the (excessive) irrelevant noisy areas. Besides, due to the poor alignment of some CXR images, the existence of irregular borders hinders the network performance. For addressing the above problems, we propose to integrate the global and local cues into a three-branch attention guided convolution neural network (AG-CNN) to identify thorax diseases. An attention guided mask inference based cropping strategy is proposed to avoid noise and improve alignment in the global branch. AG-CNN also integrates the global cues to compensate the lost discriminative cues by the local branch. Specifically, we first learn a global CNN branch using global images. Then, guided by the attention heatmap generated from the global branch, we infer a mask to crop a discriminative region from the global image. The local region is used for training a local CNN branch. Lastly, we concatenate the last pooling layers of both the global and local branches for fine-tuning the fusion branch. Experiments on the ChestX-ray14 dataset demonstrate that after integrating the local cues with the global information, the average AUC scores are improved by AG-CNN. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Using 8260 cropped single-cell images from six donors, we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone. Visualizing the images with dimension reduction provides intuition into why the CNNs achieve higher accuracy than other approaches.

From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sharing healthcare data is time-consuming and notoriously difficult due to privacy and regulatory concerns. The Personal Health Train (PHT) provides a privacy-by-design infrastructure connecting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data sources and allows distributed data analysis and machine learning. Patient data never leaves a healthcare institute.
Materials and methods: Lung cancer patient-specific databases (tumor staging and post-treatment survival information) of oncology departments were translated according to a FAIR data model and stored locally in a graph database. Software was installed locally to enable deployment of distributed machine learning algorithms via a central server. Algorithms (MATLAB, code and documentation publicly available) are patient privacy-preserving as only summary statistics and regression coefficients are exchanged with the central server. A logistic regression model to predict post-treatment two-year survival was trained and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), root mean square prediction error (RMSE) and calibration plots.
Results: In 4 months, we connected databases with 23 203 patient cases across 8 healthcare institutes in 5 countries (Amsterdam, Cardiff, Maastricht, Manchester, Nijmegen, Rome, Rotterdam, Shanghai) using the PHT. Summary statistics were computed across databases. A distributed logistic regression model predicting post-treatment two-year survival was trained on 14 810 patients treated between 1978 and 2011 and validated on 8 393 patients treated between 2012 and 2015.
Conclusion: The PHT infrastructure demonstrably overcomes patient privacy barriers to healthcare data sharing and enables fast data analyses across multiple institutes from different countries with different regulatory regimens. This infrastructure promotes global evidence-based medicine while prioritizing patient privacy. (C) 2019 The Authors.

It provides a uniform microstructure with similar to 99% theoretical density and similar to 700 nm grain size, which is among the best sintering practice of pure tungsten reported in the literature. Benefitting from the finer and more uniform microstructures, two-step sintered samples show better mechanical properties in bending strength and hardness. While parabolic grain growth kinetics is verified, a transition in the nominal grain boundary mobility was observed at 1400 degrees C, above which the effective activation enthalpy is similar to 6.1 eV, below which grain boundary motion is rapidly frozen with unusually large activation enthalpy of similar to 12.9 eV. Such highly nonlinear behavior in activation parameters with respect to temperature suggests that activation entropy and maybe collective behavior play a role in grain growth. We believe the as-reported two-step sintering method should also be applicable to other refractory metals and alloys, and may be generalized to multi-step or continuous-cooling sintering design using machine learning.

Besides, several transfer functions like log-sigmoid (logsig), radial basis (radbas), soft max transfer function (softmax), hard-limit (hardlim), tan-sigmoid (tansig) and triangular basis (tribas) were applied for the hidden layer, and their influences on model correctness were surveyed.

But it is still a challenge problem to accurately identify ADHD patients from healthy persons. To address this issue, we propose a dual subspace classification algorithm by using individual resting-state Functional Connectivity (FC). In detail, two subspaces respectively containing ADHD and healthy control features, called as dual subspaces, are learned with several subspace measures, wherein a modified graph embedding measure is employed to enhance the intra-class relationship of these features. Therefore, given a subject (used as test data) with its FCs, the basic classification principle is to compare its projected component energy of FCs on each subspace and then predict the ADHD or control label according to the subspace with larger energy. However, this principle in practice works with low efficiency, since the dual subspaces are unstably obtained from ADHD databases of small size. Thereby, we present an ADHD classification framework by a binary hypothesis testing of test data. Here, the FCs of test data with its ADHD or control label hypothesis are employed in the discriminative FC selection of training data to promote the stability of dual subspaces. For each hypothesis, the dual subspaces are learned from the selected FCs of training data. The total projected energy of these FCs is also calculated on the subspaces. Sequentially, the energy comparison is carried out under the binary hypotheses. The ADHD or control label is finally predicted for test data with the hypothesis of larger total energy. In the experiments on ADHD-200 dataset, our method achieves a significant classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods, where our accuracy is about 90 % for most of ADHD databases in the leave-one-out cross-validation test.","ADHD,Feature selection,Graph embedding,Graph Laplacian,Subspace learning,SVM-RFE",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Medical Informatics",,5.602,"DEFICIT,HYPERACTIVITY,DISORDER,INDIVIDUALS",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,

Unfortunately, individual institutions often lack sufficient samples, which might not provide sufficient statistical power for models. One mitigation is to expand data collection from a single institution to multiple centers to collectively increase the sample size. However, sharing sensitive biomedical data for research involves complicated issues. Machine learning models such as random forests (RF), though they are commonly used and achieve good performances for prognostic prediction, usually suffer worse performance under multicenter privacy-preserving data mining scenarios compared to a centrally trained version.
Methods and materials: In this study, a multicenter random forest prognosis prediction model is proposed that enables federated clinical data mining from horizontally partitioned datasets. By using a novel data enhancement approach based on a differentially private generative adversarial network customized to clinical prognosis data, the proposed model is able to provide a multicenter RF model with performances on par with-or even better than-centrally trained RF but without the need to aggregate the raw data. Moreover, our model also incorporates an importance ranking step designed for feature selection without sharing patient-level information.
Result: The proposed model was evaluated on colorectal cancer datasets from the US and China. Two groups of datasets with different levels of heterogeneity within the collaborative research network were selected. First, we compare the performance of the distributed random forest model under different privacy parameters with different percentages of enhancement datasets and validate the effectiveness and plausibility of our approach. Then, we compare the discrimination and calibration ability of the proposed multicenter random forest with a centrally trained random forest model and other tree-based classifiers as well as some commonly used machine learning methods. The results show that the proposed model can provide better prediction performance in terms of discrimination and calibration ability than the centrally trained RF model or the other candidate models while following the privacy-preserving rules in both groups. Additionally, good discrimination and calibration ability are shown on the simplified model based on the feature importance ranking in the proposed approach.
Conclusion: The proposed random forest model exhibits ideal prediction capability using multicenter clinical data and overcomes the performance limitation arising from privacy guarantees. It can also provide feature importance ranking across institutions without pooling the data at a central site. This study offers a practical solution for building a prognosis prediction model in the collaborative clinical research network and solves practical issues in real-world applications of medical artificial intelligence.","Clinical decision support,Distributed privacy-preserving modeling,Ensemble learning,Generative adversarial networks,Variable importance ranking",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Medical Informatics",,5.602,"PRIVACY,CALIBRATION,VALIDATION",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,

This procedure is highly generic and applicable to a variety of time sequenced signals. We then utilize this reduced feature space as input to a cluster analysis, producing zoned maps of process history.

To address these problems, we propose an unsupervised band selection method based on deep latent spectral representation learning, called DLSRL, in this article. It imposes spectral consistency on deep latent space that resolves the issue of insufficient samples and spectral information lost in HSI interpretation. It pursues the low-dimensional optimal representation of the high-dimensional HSIs. In particular, an adaptive mapping relationship is constructed between the deep latent representation and the optimal subset to preserve physical significance optimally. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is introduced to achieve target detection with the selected subset.

This architecture is designed to detect seizure events from raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as opposed to the state-of-the-art hand engineered feature-based representation employed in traditional machine learning based solutions. The seizure detection system utilises only convolutional layers in order to process the multichannel time domain signal and is designed to exploit the large amount of weakly labelled data in the training stage. The system performance is assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 834h in duration; this is further validated on a held-out publicly available dataset and compared with two baseline SVM based systems.
The developed system achieves a 56% relative improvement with respect to a feature-based state-of-the art baseline, reaching an AUC of 98.5%; this also compares favourably both in terms of performance and run-time. The effect of varying architectural parameters is thoroughly studied. The performance improvement is achieved through novel architecture design which allows more efficient usage of available training data and end-to-end optimisation from the front-end feature extraction to the back-end classification. The proposed architecture opens new avenues for the application of deep learning to neonatal EEG, where the performance becomes a function of the amount of training data with less dependency on the availability of precise clinical labels.

Therefore, the early and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays a pivotal role to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease. Several studies have developed automated techniques using different medical imaging modalities to predict breast cancer development. However, few review studies are available to recapitulate the existing literature on breast cancer classification. These studies provide an overview of the classification, segmentation, or grading of many cancer types, including breast cancer, by using traditional machine learning approaches through hand-engineered features. This review focuses on breast cancer classification by using medical imaging multimodalities through state-of-the-art artificial deep neural network approaches. It is anticipated to maximize the procedural decision analysis in five aspects, such as types of imaging modalities, datasets and their categories, pre-processing techniques, types of deep neural network, and performance metrics used for breast cancer classification. Forty-nine journal and conference publications from eight academic repositories were methodically selected and carefully reviewed from the perspective of the five aforementioned aspects. In addition, this study provided quantitative, qualitative, and critical analyses of the five aspects. This review showed that mammograms and histopathologic images were mostly used to classify breast cancer. Moreover, about 55% of the selected studies used public datasets, and the remaining used exclusive datasets. Several studies employed augmentation, scaling, and image normalization pre-processing techniques to minimize inconsistencies in breast cancer images. Several types of shallow and deep neural network architecture were employed to classify breast cancer using images. The convolutional neural network was utilized frequently to construct an effective breast cancer classification model. Some of the selected studies employed a pre-trained network or developed new deep neural networks to classify breast cancer. Most of the selected studies used accuracy and area-under-the-curve metrics followed by sensitivity, precision, and F-measure metrics to evaluate the performance of the developed breast cancer classification models. Finally, this review presented 10 open research challenges for future scholars who are interested to develop breast cancer classification models through various imaging modalities. This review could serve as a valuable resource for beginners on medical image classification and for advanced scientists focusing on deep learning-based breast cancer classification through different medical imaging modalities.","Breast cancer classification,Deep learning,Medical imaging modalities,Convolutional neural network",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,7.857,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,NETWORK,LESIONS,PERFORMANCE,MAMMOGRAMS,PREDICTION,FRAMEWORK,ENSEMBLE,SYSTEMS,TUMORS",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,,

According to the importance of fresh chicken meat consumption in people's daily diet, recognition of fresh chicken meat from frozen-thawed one is an essential issue. In the mentioned system, eight sensors (MOS type) were applied. The outputs of sensors were preprocessed, then features were extracted, and fuzzy K-nearest neighbors (F-KNN) algorithm was applied for classification. Chicken meats were classified in two classes (fresh and frozen-thawed). Also, each group of fresh and frozen-thawed chicken meat was classified in five classes according to their shelf life (elapsed day after slaughtering/thawing). The obtained results showed that the average amount of accuracy for fresh-chilled chicken meat classification and frozen-thawed one were 95.2 and 94.67%, respectively. Finally, the accuracy of fresh chicken meat with 95.83% demonstrated the high accuracy of it compare with frozen-thawed one. According to the results, high performance of F-KNN algorithm demonstrated that e-nose system can be applied as a rapid, accurate, and nondestructive method for online and automated identification of fresh and frozen-thawed chicken meat.","Fresh-chilled,Frozen-thawed,Chicken meat,Electronic nose,Fuzzy K-nearest neighbors algorithm",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Food Science & Technology,,3.07,"ELECTRONIC,NOSE,NONDESTRUCTIVE,PREDICTION,MODIFIED,ATMOSPHERE,PORK,MEAT,QUALITY,SENSOR,ADULTERATION,DIFFERENTIATION,ATTRIBUTES,MANAGEMENT",FOOD ANALYTICAL METHODS,,

To develop the ANN models, the feed-forward neural network with the backpropagation algorithm was developed. For firmness, the best ANN model with 7-11-1 topology (7 features as inputs, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, and one output) had the highest R-Prediction(2) and the lowest MAE(Prediction) and SEPrediction which were equal to 0.999, 0.0836 N, and 0.1119 N, respectively.

Their designs have evolved through incremental modification and stepwise inspiration by researchers; however, a complete survey of the large molecular space is experimentally intractable. Machine learning (ML), based on the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence technology, offers high throughput material exploration that is more efficient than high-cost quantum chemical calculations. This review describes the present status and perspective of ML-based development (materials informatics) of organic electronics. Although the complexity of OFET, OLED, and OPV makes revealing their structure-property relationships difficult, a cooperative approach incorporating virtual ML, human consideration, and fast experimental screening may help to navigate growth and development in the organic electronics field.

Respiration harmonics distort and overwhelm the measurement of heartbeat due to the large signal amplitude. A supervised machine learning algorithm, the gamma filter, offers an efficient, calibration-free solution to model the time series heartbeat signal given respiration and respiration artifacts. The measured signal is provided by a 5.8-GHz quadrature Doppler radar and a modified electrocardiogram signal is used as the ground truth for training the filter.

Notably, learning intrinsic structures from multiple heterogeneous features is significant but challenging in multi-view disease understanding. Different from existing methods that separately deal with each single view, this paper proposes a discriminative Margin-Sensitive Autoencoder (MSAE) framework for automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and accurate protein fold recognition. Generally, our MSAE aims to collaboratively explore the complementary properties of multi-view bioimage features in a semantic-sensitive encoder-decoder paradigm, where the discriminative semantic space is explicitly constructed in a margin-scalable regression model. Specifically, we develop a semantic-sensitive autoencoder, where an encoder projects multi-view visual features into the common semantic-aware latent space, and a decoder is exerted as an additional constraint to reconstruct the respective visual features. In particular, the importance of different views is adaptively weighted by self-adjusting learning scheme, such that their underlying correlations and complementary characteristics across multiple views are simultaneously preserved into the latent common representations. Moreover, a flexible semantic space is formulated by a margin-scalable support vector machine to improve the discriminability of the learning model. Importantly, correntropy induced metric is exploited as a robust regularization measurement to better control outliers for effective classification. A half-quadratic minimization and alternating learning strategy are devised to optimize the resulting framework such that each subproblem exists a closed-form solution in each iterative minimization phase. Extensive experimental results performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets show that our MSAE can achieve superior performances for both binary and multi-class classification in AD diagnosis, and evaluations on protein folds demonstrate that our method can achieve very encouraging performance on protein structure recognition, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

Consolidation is a common term in radiology, which indicates focally increased lung density. When the alveolar structures become filled with pus, fluid, blood cells or protein subsequent to a pulmonary pathological process, it may result in different types of lung opacity in chest radiograph. This study aims at detecting consolidations in chest x-ray radiographs, with a certain precision, using artificial intelligence and especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to assist radiologist for better diagnosis.
Methods: Medical image datasets usually are relatively small to be used for training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), so transfer learning technique with well-known DCNNs pre-trained with Image-Net dataset are used to improve the accuracy of the models. ImageNet feature space is different from medical images and in the other side, the well-known DCNNs are designed to achieve the best performance on ImageNet. Therefore, they cannot show their best performance on medical images. To overcome this problem, we designed a problem-based architecture which preserves the information of images for detecting consolidation in Pediatric Chest X-ray dataset. We proposed a three-step pre-processing approach to enhance generalization of the models. To demonstrate the correctness of numerical results, an occlusion test is applied to visualize outputs of the model and localize the detected appropriate area. A different dataset as an extra validation is used in order to investigate the generalization of the proposed model.
Results: The best accuracy to detect consolidation is 94.67% obtained by our problem based architecture for the understudy dataset which outperforms the previous works and the other architectures.
Conclusions: The designed models can be employed as computer aided diagnosis tools in real practice. We critically discussed the datasets and the previous works based on them and show that without some considerations the results of them may be misleading. We believe, the output of AI should be only interpreted as focal consolidation. The clinical significance of the finding can not be interpreted without integration of clinical data.

There have been dozens of studies on thyroid gland segmentation and thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images. The aim of this work is to categorize and review the thyroid gland segmentation and thyroid nodule segmentation methods in medical ultrasound.
Methods This work proposes a categorization approach of thyroid gland segmentation and thyroid nodule segmentation methods according to the theoretical bases of segmentation methods. The segmentation methods are categorized into four groups, including contour and shape based methods, region based methods, machine and deep learning methods and hybrid methods. The representative articles are reviewed with detailed descriptions of methods and analyses of correlations between methods. The evaluation metrics for the reviewed segmentation methods are named uniformly in this work. The segmentation performance results using the uniformly named evaluation metrics are compared.
Results After careful investigation, 28 representative papers are selected for comprehensive analyses and comparisons in this review. The dominant thyroid gland segmentation methods are machine and deep learning methods. The training of massive data makes these models have better segmentation performance and robustness. But deep learning models usually require plenty of marked training data and long training time. For thyroid nodule segmentation, the most common methods are contour and shape based methods, which have good segmentation performance. However, most of them are tested on small datasets.
Conclusions Based on the comprehensive consideration of application scenario, image features, method practicability and segmentation performance, the appropriate segmentation method for specific situation can be selected. Furthermore, several limitations of current thyroid ultrasound image segmentation methods are presented, which may be overcome in future studies, such as the segmentation of pathological or abnormal thyroid glands, identification of the specific nodular diseases, and the standard thyroid ultrasound image datasets.

However, owing to its complex anatomical structure, it is extremely challenging to automatically segment the coronary artery from 3D coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Inspired by recent ideas to use tree-structured long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the underlying tree structures for NLP tasks, we propose a novel tree-structured convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU) model to learn the anatomical structure of the coronary artery. However, unlike tree-structured LSTM proposed for semantic relatedness as well as sentiment classification in natural language processing, our tree-structured ConvGRU model considers the local spatial correlations in the input data as the convolutions are used for input-to-state as well as state-to-state transitions, thus more suitable for image analysis. To conduct voxel-wise segmentation, a tree-structured segmentation framework is presented. It consists of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for multi-scale discriminative feature extraction and the final prediction, and a tree-structured ConvGRU layer for anatomical structure modeling. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on four large-scale 3D CCTA dataset (the largest to the best of our knowledge), and experiments show that our method is more accurate as well as efficient, compared with other coronary artery segmentation approaches.

However, current screening protocols are often not effective at finding the disease early. Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) is a promising new imaging tool for finding dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) at an early stage, by acquiring cross-sectional images of the microscopic structure of BE up to 3-mm deep. However, interpretation of VLE scans is difficult for medical doctors due to both the size and subtlety of the gray-scale data. Therefore, algorithms that can accurately find cancerous regions are very valuable for the interpretation of VLE data. In this study, we propose a fully-automatic multi-step Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) algorithm that optimally leverages the effectiveness of deep learning strategies by encoding the principal dimension in VLE data. Additionally, we show that combining the encoded dimensions with conventional machine learning techniques further improves results while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, we train and validate our algorithm on a new histopathologically validated set of in-vivo VLE snapshots. Additionally, an independent test set is used to assess the performance of the model. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against previous state-of-the-art systems. With the encoded principal dimension, we obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F-1 score of 0.93 and 87.4% on the test set respectively. We show this is a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.89 and 83.1%, respectively, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Results illustrate that the developed model can provide a reliable result for monitoring the weld bead, which could give guidance for controlling the processing parameters in real time to improve the weld quality for practical LBW-AMF.","Data-driven model,Laser beam welding,Image processing,Neural networks,Online monitoring",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,"ANGULAR,DISTORTION,FEATURE-SELECTION,NEURAL-NETWORKS,ALUMINUM-ALLOY,KEYHOLE,REGRESSION,PREDICTION,POOL,OPTIMIZATION,PENETRATION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,

The cooling of molten metal inside the mold is achieved typically by passing water through the cooling lines in the die. Depending on the cooling line location, coolant flow rate and die geometry, nonuniform temperatures are imposed on the molten metal at the mold wall. This boundary condition along with the initial molten metal temperature affect the product quality quantified in terms of micro-structure parameters and yield strength. A finite volume based numerical solver is used to determine the temperature-time history and correlate the inputs to outputs. The objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a procedure to obtain the initial and wall temperatures so as to optimize the product quality. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-objective optimization in this work. The number of function evaluations required for NSGA-II can be of the order of millions and hence, the finite volume solver cannot be used directly for optimization. Therefore, a multilayer perceptron feed-forward neural network is first trained using the results from the numerical solution of the fluid flow and energy equations and is subsequently used as a surrogate model. As an assessment, simplified versions of the actual problem are designed to first verify results of the genetic algorithm. An innovative local sensitivity based approach is then used to rank the final Pareto optimal solutions and select a single best design.","Die casting,Deep neural networks,Multi-objective optimization",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Engineering,,5.135,"MULTIOBJECTIVE,GENETIC,ALGORITHM,GRAIN-REFINEMENT,NEURAL-NETWORKS,FLOW,ALUMINUM,DESIGN",JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02364,

Allen","Lim SN,Ahunbay EE,Nasief H,Zheng C,Lawton C,Li XA",Li XA,10.1016/j.prro.2019.08.007,Medical College of Wisconsin,"Purpose: Although vital to account for interfractional variations during radiation therapy, online adaptive replanning (OLAR) is time-consuming and labor-intensive compared with the repositioning method. Repositioning is enough for minimal interfractional deformations. Therefore, determining indications for OLAR is desirable. We introduce a method to rapidly determine the need for OLAR by analyzing the Jacobian determinant histogram (JDH) obtained from deformable image registration between reference (planning) and daily images.
Methods and Materials: The proposed method was developed and tested based on daily computed tomography (CT) scans acquired during image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer using an in-room CT scanner. Deformable image registration between daily and reference CT scans was performed. JDHs were extracted from the prostate and a uniform surrounding 10-mm expansion. A classification tree was trained to determine JDH metrics to predict the need for OLAR for a daily CT set. Sixty daily CT scans from 12 randomly selected prostate cases were used as the training data set, with dosimetric plans for both OLAR and repositioning used to determine their class. The resulting classification tree was tested using an independent data set of 45 daily CT scans from 9 other patients with 5 CT scans each.
Results: Of a total of 27 JDH metrics tested, 5 were identified predicted whether OLAR was substantially superior to repositioning for a given fraction. A decision tree was constructed using the obtained metrics from the training set. This tree correctly identified all cases in the test set where benefits of OLAR were obvious.
Conclusions: A decision tree based on JDH metrics to quickly determine the necessity of online replanning based on the image of the day without segmentation was determined using a machine learning process. The process can be automated and completed within a minute, allowing users to quickly decide which fractions require OLAR. (C) 2019 American Society for Radiation Oncology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These tools provide relevant insights about material reliability, mechanical performance and platform design vulnerability to support the determination of safety critical aspects, such as response to blast and fragmentation loading.
Analytical models are inherently simplified, limiting their ability to accurately model scenarios with complicated geometries and material properties, or highly non-linear loadings. Appropriate experimental and numerical modelling can overcome the limitations of analytical models but also require long lead times and high associated costs. These issues can be a point of concern for projects with strict development schedules, short time-to-solution, and limited resources.
Machine learning techniques have proven viable in the development of fast-running models for highly nonlinear problems. The present work explores four models based on the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for assessing the mechanical response of mild steel plates subjected to localised blast loading. Experiments combined with validated Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models provide a hybrid dataset for training ANNs. The resultant dataset is a combination of sparsely populated experimental data with a denser dataset of validated FEA simulations. The final results demonstrate the potential of ANNs to incorporate high strain-rate material response behaviour, such as that from blast loading, into optimised models that can yield timely predictions of structural response.","Vulnerability assessment,Multilayer perceptron,Artificial neural networks,Finite element Analysis,High strain-rate,Localised blast",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mechanics",,,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,NUMERICAL,SIMULATIONS,DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR,PLASTIC,RESPONSE,FLOW-STRESS,THIN,PLATES,PREDICTION,MODEL,FAILURE,ALGORITHM",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING,,

Materials and methods One hundred and fifteen patients with PA and 22 with CXPA were included. Four radiologists with different experience independently placed one-point and whole-tumor ROIs and a radiomics-predictive model was constructed from the extracted imaging features. We calculated the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) for the diagnostic performance of imaging features and the radiomics-predictive model. Results AUCs of the imaging features from whole-tumor varied between readers (0.50-0.89). The most experienced radiologist (Reader 1) produced significantly high AUCs than less experienced radiologists (Reader 3 and 4; P = 0.01 and 0.009). AUCs were higher for the radiomics-predictive model (0.82-0.87) than for one-point (0.66-0.79) in all readers. Conclusion Some imaging features of whole-tumor and radiomics-predictive model had higher diagnostic performance than one-point. The diagnostic performance of imaging features from whole-tumor alone varied depending on operator experience. Operator experience appears less likely to affect diagnostic performance in the radiomics-predictive model.","Pleomorphic adenoma,Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma,Radiomics,Machine learning,Diagnostic performance",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,1.857,"SALIVARY-GLAND,TUMORS,PAROTID-GLAND,PREDICTION,SELECTION,ACCURACY,BENIGN",JAPANESE JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,,

Materials and methods The study participants were 87 patients who had undergone pretreatment MRI and definitive radiotherapy for CC. VOItumor was created with tumor alone and VOI+4 mm-VOI+20 mm mechanically expanded by 4-20 mm around each VOItumor in axial T2-weighted images (T2WI) and an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. A model was constructed to predict recurrence within the irradiation field within 2 years after treatment using imaging features from the VOI of each sequence. Sorting ability was evaluated by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) analysis. Results VOI expansion improved AUC-ROCs compared with the predictive models of VOItumor (0.59 and 0.67 in T2WI and ADC, respectively). The AUC-ROCs of the models with imaging features from expanded VOI+4 mm in T2WI and VOI+4 mm and VOI+8 mm in ADC were 0.82, 0.82, and 0.86, respectively.

Developing an effective mathematical method for accurately estimating shear strength of RC beams is beneficial for civil engineers. This work presents a hybrid artificial intelligent (AI) model for effectively predicting the shear strength of various types of RC beam. The hybrid AI model was developed by integrating an optimization algorithm [smart firefly algorithm (SFA)] and machine learning [least squares support vector regression (LSSVR)], in which the SFA was used to optimize the hyperparameters of LSSVR, improving its predictive accuracy. Three large datasets were used to train and test the hybrid AI model in predicting shear strength of RC beams. The predictive accuracy of the hybrid AI model was compared comprehensively with those of single AI models, ensemble AI models, and empirical methods. The comparison results show that the hybrid AI model outperformed the others in predicting the shear strength of a wide range of RC beam types. In particular, with the test data of RC beams without stirrups, the hybrid AI model yielded a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 21.703%. In predicting shear strength of RC beams with stirrups, the hybrid AI model yielded an MAPE of 12.941%. For RC beams with FRP reinforcement, the hybrid AI model yielded an MAPE 18.951%. Therefore, this hybrid AI model can be a better alternative method to help civil engineers in designing RC beams.","Structural design,Artificial intelligence,Machine learning,Reinforced concrete beam,Shear strength,Civil engineering",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Computer Science,,3.518,"ADAPTIVE,REGRESSION,SPLINES,SUPPORT,VECTOR,REGRESSION,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,FIREFLY,ALGORITHM,OPTIMIZATION,EQUATIONS",SOFT COMPUTING,,

Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac MRI and 24-hour Hotter monitoring within 1 year before cardiac MRI. There were 42 men and 22 women with a mean age of 48.13 +/- 13.06 (SD) years range: 20-70 years). Quantitative textural features were extracted via manually placed regions of interest in areas with high and intermediate signal intensity on late gadolinium-chetate enhanced images. Feature selection and dimension reduction were performed. The diagnostic performances of machine learning classifiers including support vector machines, Naive Bayes, k-nearest-neighbors, and random forest for predicting the presence of VT were assessed using the results of 24-hour Hotter monitoring as the reference test. All machine learning models were assessed with and without the application of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE).
Results: Of the 64 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 21/64 (32.8%) had VT. Of eight machine learning models investigated, k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE exhibited the best diagnostic accuracy for the presence or absence of VT. k-nearest-neighbors with SMOTE correctly identified 40/42 (95.2%) VT-positive patients and 40/43 (93.0%) VT-negative patients, yielding 95.2% sensitivity (95% CI: 82.5%-99.1%), 93.0% specificity (95% CI: 79.8%-98.1%) and 94.1% accuracy (95% CI: 88.8%-98%).

Therefore, in this study, a predictive model has been proposed to predict the incidence time of tremor bursts. In the proposed approach, the Markov nonlinear hidden model was employed. The mentioned model was trained once by using the algorithm of Baum Welch and again by combining this algorithm with the maximum entropy algorithm. The Hidden Markov models (HMM) were once trained with raw EMG (Electromyogram) data and by using the extracted features from the EMG signal. The output of the model predicts the occurrence or absence of tremors. The EMG signals were recorded from 11 patients with different pathologic abnormalities. The features such as integrated EMG, mean frequency, and peak frequency were extracted from EMG data and ranked using the RELIEF algorithm.

To overcome this limitation, the first step toward registration is the extraction of the outer edge of the kidney. Methods To tackle this task, we propose a deep learning-based solution. Rather than working only on the raw laparoscopic images, the network is given depth information and distance fields to predict whether a pixel of the image belongs to an edge.

Results The proposed contour-aware segmentation improved the segmentation performance, and when compared against existing algorithms on the same publicly available database of 247 chest X-ray images, the UNet architecture with the ResNeXt50 encoder combined with the contour-aware approach resulted in the best overall segmentation performance, achieving a Jaccard overlap coefficient of 0.971, 0.933, and 0.903 for the lung fields, heart, and clavicles, respectively. Conclusion In this study, we proposed to augment CNN architectures for CXR segmentation with organ contour information and were able to significantly improve segmentation accuracy and outperform all existing solution using a public chest X-ray database.","Image segmentation,Convolutional neural networks,Deep learning architectures,Chest X-ray (CXR) images,JSRT database",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"LUNG,SEGMENTATION,RADIOGRAPHS,SHAPE,CT,MR",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Automatic needle tracking and trajectory prediction can increase operator confidence in performing biopsies, reduce procedure time, minimize the risk of inadvertent biopsy bleedings, and enable future image-guided robotic procedures. Methods In this paper, we propose a tracking-by-segmentation model with spatial and channel ""Squeeze and Excitation"" (scSE) for US needle detection and trajectory prediction. We adopt a light deep learning architecture (e.g. LinkNet) as our segmentation baseline network and integrate the scSE module to learn spatial information for better prediction. The proposed model is trained with the US images of anonymized kidney biopsy clips from 8 patients. The contour is obtained using the border-following algorithm and area calculated using Green formula. Trajectory prediction is made by extrapolating from the smallest bounding box that can capture the contour. Results We train and test our model on a total of 996 images extracted from 102 short videos at a rate of 3 frames per second from each video. A set of 794 images is used for training and 202 images for testing. Our model has achieved IOU of 41.01%, dice accuracy of 56.65%, F1-score of 36.61%, and root-mean-square angle error of 13.3 circle\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{\circ }$$\end{document}. We are thus able to predict and extrapolate the trajectory of the biopsy needle with decent accuracy for interventionists to better perform biopsies. Conclusion Our novel model combining LinkNet and scSE shows a promising result for kidney biopsy application, which implies potential to other similar ultrasound-guided biopsies that require needle tracking and trajectory prediction.","Ultrasound imaging,Needle tracking,Minimally invasive surgery,Concurrent Spatial and Channel ""Squeeze and Excitation"",LinkNet",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"TRACKING,IMAGES",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,
97,Toward automatic quantification of knee osteoarthritis severity using improved Faster R-CNN,15,3,457-466,"Liu Bin,Luo Jianxu,Huang Huan","Liu B,Luo JX,Huang H",Luo JX,10.1007/s11548-019-02096-9,East China University of Science & Technology,"Purpose Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease that impairs knee function and causes pain. Radiologists usually review knee X-ray images and grade the severity of the impairments according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scheme. However, this approach becomes inefficient in hospitals with high throughput as it is time-consuming, tedious and also subjective. This paper introduces a model for automatic diagnosis of knee OA based on an end-to-end deep learning method. Method In order to process the input images with location and classification simultaneously, we use Faster R-CNN as baseline, which consists of region proposal network (RPN) and Fast R-CNN. The RPN is trained to generate region proposals, which contain knee joint and then be used by Fast R-CNN for classification. Due to the localized classification via CNNs, the useless information in X-ray images can be filtered and we can extract clinically relevant features. For the further improvement in the model's performance, we use a novel loss function whose weighting scheme allows us to address the class imbalance. Besides, larger anchors are used to overcome the problem that anchors don't match the object when increasing the input size of X-ray images. Result The performance of the proposed model is thoroughly assessed using various measures. The results show that our adjusted model outperforms the Faster R-CNN, achieving a mean average precision nearly 0.82 with a sensitivity above 78% and a specificity above 94%. It takes 0.33 s to test each image, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and speed. Conclusion The proposed end-to-end fully automatic model which is computationally efficient has the potential to achieve the real automatic diagnosis of knee OA and be used as computer-aided diagnosis tools in clinical applications.","Knee osteoarthritis,X-ray,Deep learning,Faster R-CNN,Focal loss",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,HIP,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Recent research has proven that computers are capable of inferring physical properties from camera images like humans. However, few studies perceive the physical properties in more complex environment, i.e. humans have difficulty estimating physical quantities directly from the visual observation, or encounter difficulty visualizing the physical process in mind according to their daily experiences. As an appropriate example, fractional flow reserve (FFR), which measures the blood pressure difference across the vessel stenosis, becomes an important physical quantitative value determining the likelihood of myocardial ischemia in clinical coronary intervention procedure. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network solution (TreeVes-Net) that allows machines to perceive FFR values directly from static coronary CT angiography images. Our framework fully utilizes a tree-structured recurrent neural network (RNN) with a coronary representation encoder. The encoder captures coronary geometric information providing the blood fluid-related representation. The tree-structured RNN builds a long-distance spatial dependency of blood flow information inside the coronary tree. The experiments performed on 13000 synthetic coronary trees and 180 real coronary trees from clinical patients show that the values of the area under ROC curve (AUC) are 0.92 and 0.93 under two clinical criterions. These results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and its superiority to seven FFR computation methods based on machine learning. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

OCC needs samples from only one class to train the model. Most recently, kernel regularized least squares (KRL) method-based deep architecture is developed for the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension of this method by embedding minimum variance information within this architecture. This embedding improves the generalization capability of the classifier by reducing the intra-class variance. In contrast to traditional deep learning methods, this method can effectively work with small-size datasets. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on 18 benchmark datasets (13 biomedical and 5 other datasets) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed classifier. We compare the results with 16 state-of-the-art one-class classifiers. Further, we also test our method for 2 real-world biomedical datasets viz.; detection of Alzheimer's disease from structural magnetic resonance imaging data and detection of breast cancer from histopathological images. Proposed method exhibits more than 5% F-1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for various biomedical benchmark datasets. This makes it viable for application in biomedical fields where relatively less amount of data is available. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this process, the high sparsity obtained by the learned dictionary and exploitation of correlation among patches are essential to the reconstructed image quality. In this paper, by a use of these two aspects, we propose a novel CS-MRI model based on analysis dictionary learning and manifold structure regularization (ADMS). Furthermore, a proper tight frame constraint is used to obtain an effective overcomplete analysis dictionary with a high sparsifying capacity. The constructed manifold structure regularization nonuniformly enforces the correlation of each group formed by similar patches, which is more consistent with the diverse nonlocal similarity in realistic images. The proposed model is efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), in which the fast algorithm for each sub-problem is separately developed. The experimental results demonstrate that main components in the proposed method contribute to the final reconstruction performance and the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
