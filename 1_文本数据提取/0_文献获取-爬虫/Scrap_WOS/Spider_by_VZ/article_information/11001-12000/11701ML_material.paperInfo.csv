Methods Popliteal artery locations were detected from each MR slice by a deep neural network model and connected into a 3D artery centerline. Vessel wall regions around the centerline were then segmented using another neural network model for segmentation in polar coordinate system. Contours from vessel wall segmentations were used for vascular feature calculation, such as mean wall thickness and wall area. A transfer learning and active learning framework was applied in training the localization and segmentation neural network models to maintain accuracy while reducing manual annotations. This new popliteal artery analysis technique (FRAPPE) was validated against manual segmentation qualitatively and quantitatively in a series of 225 cases from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. Results FRAPPE demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in locating popliteal arteries, segmenting artery walls, and quantifying arterial features. Qualitative evaluations showed 1.2% of slices had noticeable major errors, including segmenting the wrong target and irregular vessel wall contours. The mean Dice similarity coefficient with manual segmentation was 0.79, which is comparable to inter-rater variations. Repeatability evaluations show most of the vascular features have good to excellent repeatability from repeated scans of same subjects, with intra-class coefficient ranging from 0.80 to 0.98. Conclusion This technique can be used in large population-based studies, such as OAI, to efficiently assess the burden of atherosclerosis from routine MR knee scans.","atherosclerosis,machine learning,popliteal artery,vessel wall imaging,vessel wall segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"CAROTID-ARTERY,SEGMENTATION,PLAQUE,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,QUANTIFICATION,ASSOCIATION,RELIABILITY,THICKNESS,DISEASE,RISK",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8320767,

Accurate prediction of their compressive strength is vital for structural design. However, empirical methods are limited to consider simultaneously all influencing factors in predicting the compressive strength of foamed concrete materials. Thus, this study proposed a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) model which couples the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with the grey wolf optimization (GWO) to consider effectively the influencing factors and improve the predictive accuracy in predicting the foamed concrete's compressive strength. Performance of the proposed model was evaluated using a real-world dataset. Comparison results confirm that the proposed GWO-LSSVR model was superior than the support vector regression, artificial neural networks, random forest, and M5Rules with the improvement rate of 144.2-284.0% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Notably, the evaluation results show that the GWO-LSSVR model showed the good agreement between the actual and predicted values with the correlation coefficient of 0.991 and MAPE of 3.54%.

The diagnosis of some lesions, such as microcalcifications, is still difficult today for radiologists. In this paper, we proposed an automatic binary model for discriminating tissue in digital mammograms, as support tool for the radiologists. In particular, we compared the contribution of different methods on the feature selection process in terms of the learning performances and selected features. Results For each ROI, we extracted textural features on Haar wavelet decompositions and also interest points and corners detected by using Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) and Minimum Eigenvalue Algorithm (MinEigenAlg). Then a Random Forest binary classifier is trained on a subset of a sub-set features selected by two different kinds of feature selection techniques, such as filter and embedded methods. We tested the proposed model on 260 ROIs extracted from digital mammograms of the BCDR public database. The best prediction performance for the normal/abnormal and benign/malignant problems reaches a median AUC value of 98.16% and 92.08%, and an accuracy of 97.31% and 88.46%, respectively. The experimental result was comparable with related work performance. Conclusions The best performing result obtained with embedded method is more parsimonious than the filter one.

The location of the tumor - the laterality - can be unilateral (the tumor is affecting one side of the prostate), or bilateral on both sides. Nevertheless, the tumor can be overestimated or underestimated by standard screening methods. In this work, a combination of efficient machine learning methods for feature selection and classification are proposed to analyze gene activity and select them as relevant biomarkers for different laterality samples. Results A data set that consists of 450 samples was used in this study. The samples were divided into three laterality classes (left, right, bilateral). The aim of this work is to understand the genomic activity in each class and find relevant genes as indicators for each class with nearly 99% accuracy. The system identified groups of differentially expressed genes (RTN1, HLA-DMB, MRI1) that are able to differentiate samples among the three classes. Conclusion The proposed method was able to detect sets of genes that can identify different laterality classes. The resulting genes are found to be strongly correlated with disease progression. HLA-DMB and EIF4G2, which are detected in the set of genes can detect the left laterality, were reported earlier to be in the same pathway called Allograft rejection SuperPath.","Machine learning,Classification,Biomarkers,Prostate cancer laterality",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"METHIONINE,DEPENDENCY,RNA,IDENTIFICATION,PROGRESSION,CLASSIFIER,DISCOVERY,GROWTH,IL-6",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068980,

Systematic characterization of the cancer microbiome provides the opportunity to develop techniques that exploit non-human, microorganism-derived molecules in the diagnosis of a major human disease. Following recent demonstrations that some types of cancer show substantial microbial contributions(1-10), we re-examined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas(11) (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,116 samples) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major types of cancer. These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia-IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. This potential microbiome-based oncology diagnostic tool warrants further exploration.","READ ALIGNMENT,HALLMARKS,PLATFORM,ORIGIN",Article,"NATURE PORTFOLIO, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,54.637,"READ,ALIGNMENT,HALLMARKS,PLATFORM,ORIGIN",NATURE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500457,
6,Applications of machine learning for simulations of red blood cells in microfluidic devices,21,,,"Bachraty Hynek,Bachrata Katarina,Chovanec Michal,Jancigova Iveta,Smieskova Monika,Kovalcikova Kristina","Bachraty H,Bachrata K,Chovanec M,Jancigova I,Smieskova M,Kovalcikova K",Bachrata K,10.1186/s12859-020-3357-5,University of Zilina,"Background For optimization of microfluidic devices for the analysis of blood samples, it is useful to simulate blood cells as elastic objects in flow of blood plasma. In such numerical models, we primarily need to take into consideration the movement and behavior of the dominant component of the blood, the red blood cells. This can be done quite precisely in small channels and within a short timeframe. However, larger volumes or timescales require different approaches. Instead of simplifying the simulation, we use a neural network to predict the movement of the red blood cells. Results The neural network uses data from the numerical simulation for learning, however, the simulation needs only be run once. Alternatively, the data could come from video processing of a recording of a biological experiment. Afterwards, the network is able to predict the movement of the red blood cells because it is a system of bases that gives an approximate cell velocity at each point of the simulation channel as a linear combination of bases.In a simple box geometry, the neural network gives results comparable to predictions using fluid streamlines, however in a channel with obstacles forming slits, the neural network is about five times more accurate.The network can also be used as a discriminator between different situations. We observe about two-fold increase in mean relative error when a network trained on one geometry is used to predict trajectories in a modified geometry. Even larger increase was observed when it was used to predict trajectories of cells with different elastic properties. Conclusions While for uncomplicated box channels there is no advantage in using a system of bases instead of a simple prediction using fluid streamlines, in a more complicated geometry, the neural network is significantly more accurate. Another application of this system of bases is using it as a comparison tool for different modeled situations. This has a significant future potential when applied to processing data from videos of microfluidic flows.","Red blood cell,Simulation of fluid,Cell trajectories,Microfluidic device,Neural network",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7068868?pdf=render,

The survival rates of melanoma from early to terminal stages is more than fifty percent. Therefore, having the right information at the right time by early detection with monitoring skin lesions to find potential problems is essential to surviving this type of cancer. Results An approach to classify skin lesions using deep learning for early detection of melanoma in a case-based reasoning (CBR) system is proposed. This approach has been employed for retrieving new input images from the case base of the proposed system DePicT Melanoma Deep-CLASS to support users with more accurate recommendations relevant to their requested problem (e.g., image of affected area). The efficiency of our system has been verified by utilizing the ISIC Archive dataset in analysis of skin lesion classification as a benign and malignant melanoma. The kernel of DePicT Melanoma Deep-CLASS is built upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) composed of sixteen layers (excluding input and ouput layers), which can be recursively trained and learned. Our approach depicts an improved performance and accuracy in testing on the ISIC Archive dataset. Conclusions Our methodology derived from a deep CNN, generates case representations for our case base to use in the retrieval process. Integration of this approach to DePicT Melanoma CLASS, significantly improving the efficiency of its image classification and the quality of the recommendation part of the system.

Recently, traditional authentication methods such as passwords, tokens, and so on are no longer used for authentication as they are more prone to theft and different types of violations. Therefore, new authentication approaches based on biometric modalities such as heartbeat pattern obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are considered. Unlike other biometrics, ECG provides the assurance that the person is alive, and is considered as one of the most accurate recent methods for authentication. In this article, two end-to-end deep neural network models for ECG-based authentication are proposed.

9,Force Anticipation and Its Potential Implications on Feedforward and Feedback Human Motor Control,63,4,647-662,"Kimpara Hideyuki,Mbanisi Kenechukwu C.,Li Zhi,Troy Karen L.,Prokhorov Danil,Gennert Michael A.","Kimpara H,Mbanisi KC,Li Z,Troy KL,Prokhorov D,Gennert MA",Gennert MA,10.1177/0018720819900842,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Objective
To investigate the effects of human force anticipation, we conducted an experimental load-pushing task with diverse combinations of informed and actual loading weights.
Background
Human motor control tends to rely upon the anticipated workload to plan the force to exert, particularly in fast tasks such as pushing objects in less than 1 s. The motion and force responses in such tasks may depend on the anticipated resistive forces, based on a learning process.
Method
Pushing performances of 135 trials were obtained from 9 participants. We varied the workload by changing the masses from 0.2 to 5 kg. To influence anticipation, participants were shown a display of the workload that was either correct or incorrect. We collected the motion and force data, as well as electromyography (EMG) signals from the actively used muscle groups.
Results
Overanticipation produced overshoot performances in more than 80% of trials. Lighter actual workloads were also associated with overshoot. Pushing behaviors with heavier workloads could be classified into feedforward-dominant and feedback-dominant responses based on the timing of force, motion, and EMG responses. In addition, we found that the preceding trial condition affected the performance of the subsequent trial.
Conclusion
Our results show that the first peak of the pushing force increases consistently with anticipatory workload.
Application
This study improves our understanding of human motion control and can be applied to situations such as simulating interactions between drivers and assistive systems in intelligent vehicles.","motor control,cognitive task analysis,discrete event simulation,electromyography (EMG),upper extremity",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Behavioral Sciences,Engineering,Psychology",,4.173,"OBJECT,MANIPULATION,MODEL,CONTRACTION,ADJUSTMENTS,MOVEMENT,SHAPE",HUMAN FACTORS,,

It is expensive and time consuming to collect labeled EEG data for use in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, however. In this paper, a novel active learning method is proposed to minimize the amount of labeled, subject-specific EEG data required for effective classifier training, by combining measures of uncertainty and representativeness within an extreme learning machine (ELM). Following this approach, an ELM classifier was first used to select a relatively large batch of unlabeled examples, whose uncertainty was measured through the best-versus-second-best (BvSB) strategy. The diversity of each sample was then measured between the limited labeled training data and previously selected unlabeled samples, and similarity is measured among the previously selected samples. Finally, a tradeoff parameter is introduced to control the balance between informative and representative samples, and these samples are then used to construct a powerful ELM classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and multiclass motor imagery EEG datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm exceeds or matches those of several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms. It is thereby shown that the proposed method improves classifier performance and reduces the need for training samples in BCI applications.","MACHINE,QUERY,ELM",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Mathematical & Computational Biology,Neurosciences & Neurology",,,"MACHINE,QUERY,ELM",COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2020/3287589.pdf,

In this contribution, a reconstruction methodology is proposed based on machine learning. Three machine-learning algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and relevance vector regression (RVR), have been employed for RPT reconstruction. The results show that the position reconstruction accuracy of SVR was best for all cases and that the accuracy of RVR was comparable to SVR for large training datasets.

The conductivity is known to be sensitive to Y concentration: 8 mol. % YSZ (8YSZ) achieves the best performance, which, however, degrades remarkably under similar to 1000 degrees C working conditions. Here, using the recently developed SSW-NN method, stochastic surface walking global optimization based on global neural network potential (G-NN), we establish the first ternary Y-Zr-O G-NN potential by fitting 28 803 first principles dataset screened from more than 10(7) global potential energy surface (PES) data and explore exhaustively the global PES of YSZ at different Y concentrations. Rich information on the thermodynamics and the anion diffusion kinetics of YSZ is, thus, gleaned, which helps resolve the long-standing puzzles on the stability and conductivity of the 8YSZ. We demonstrate that (i) 8YSZ is the cubic phase YSZ with the lowest possible Y concentrations. It is thermodynamically unstable, tending to segregate into the monoclinic phase of 6.7YSZ and the cubic phase of 20YSZ. (ii) The O anion diffusion in YSZ is mediated by O vacancy sites and moves along the 100 direction. In 8YSZ and 10YSZ, despite different Y concentrations, their anion diffusion barriers are similar, similar to 1 eV, but in 8YSZ, the O diffusion distance is much longer due to the lack of O vacancy aggregation along the 112 direction.

However, experimental discovery and optimization of thermoelectric materials have long relied on the traditional Edisonian trial and error approach. Herein, we demonstrate that ultrahigh thermoelectric performance in a Cu-doped PbSe-PbS system can be realized by HTP experimental screening and precise property modulation. Combining the HTP experimental technique with transport model analysis, an optimal Se/S ratio showing high thermoelectric performance has been efficiently screened out. Subsequently, based on the screened Se/S ratio, the doping content of Cu has been subtly adjusted to reach the optimum carrier concentration. As a result, an outstanding peak zT similar to 1:6 is achieved at 873 K for a 1.8 at% Cu-doped PbSe0.6S0.4 sample, which is the superior value among the n-type Te-free lead chalcogenides.

However, it is non-trivial due to the diverse shapes of the glands under different histological grades and the presence of tightly connected glands. In this paper, a novel multi-scale fully convolutional network with three class classification (TCC-MSFCN) is proposed to achieve gland segmentation. The multi-scale structure can extract different receptive field features corresponding to multi-size objects. However, the max-pooling in the convolution neural network will cause the loss of global information. To compensate for this loss, a special branch called high-resolution branch in our framework is designed. Besides, for effectively separating the close glands, a three-class classification with additional consideration of edge pixels is applied instead of the conventional binary classification. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on Warwick-QU dataset and CRAG dataset with three reliable evaluation metrics, which are applied to our method and other popular methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the-state-of-the-art performance. Discussion and conclusion are presented afterwards. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, complete and accurate segmentation is still a challenge due to the complex image context and vascular morphology. The existing model-driven methods are often difficult to obtain prominent accuracy and robustness. Deep-learning based technology has achieved unimaginable success, but always faces the problem of insufficient labeled data. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed to automate cerebrovascular segmentation, which integrates model- and data-driven methods. Firstly, the TOF-MRA data are sparsely labeled by three radiologists. Secondly, a semi-supervised mixture probability model is proposed to fit the cerebrovascular intensity distribution precisely, which starts from the sparse annotations and generates massive labeled points. Thirdly, mislabeled points are corrected by a Clean-Mechanism model, to acquire a well-labeled point-set of good quality. Finally, we construct and train a dilated dense convolution network (DD-CNN) by the resultant labeled point-set. The proposed method is validated on 109 clinical TOR-MRA data from a public dataset. Compared with the other state-of-the-art segmentation methods, our method segments cerebrovascular structure with better completeness and sensibility, especially for slender vascularity. The experimental results show that our method reaches an average dice score of 93.20%, which also indicates that the DD-CNN is very competent for cerebrovascular segmentation from TOF-MRA volume.

Firstly, the AE signals are transformed, using the Discrete Cosine Transform, followed by a dimensionality reduction stage. Afterwards, a Deep Neural Network is employed by the classification module.

However, the accuracy of SLNB to detect nodal stage N2-3 remains debatable. Nomograms can help the decision-making process between axillary treatment options. The aim of this study was to create a new model to predict the nodal stage N2-3 after a positive SLNB using machine learning methods that are rarely seen in nomogram development. Material and methods: Primary breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) between 2012 and 2017 formed cohorts for nomogram development (training cohort, N = 460) and for nomogram validation (validation cohort, N = 70). A machine learning method known as the gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) was used to determine the variables associated with nodal stage N2-3 and to create a predictive model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for comparison. Results: The best combination of variables associated with nodal stage N2-3 in XGBoost modeling included tumor size, histological type, multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, percentage of ER positive cells, number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and number of positive SLNs multiplied by tumor size. Indicating discrimination, AUC values for the training cohort and the validation cohort were 0.80 (95%CI 0.71-0.89) and 0.80 (95%CI 0.65-0.92) in the XGBoost model and 0.85 (95%CI 0.77-0.93) and 0.75 (95%CI 0.58-0.89) in the logistic regression model, respectively. Conclusions: This machine learning model was able to maintain its discrimination in the validation cohort better than the logistic regression model. This indicates advantages in employing modern artificial intelligence techniques into nomogram development. The nomogram could be used to help identify nodal stage N2-3 in early breast cancer and to select appropriate treatments for patients.","METASTASES,NOMOGRAM,RISK,MULTICENTER,VALIDATION,TOOLS",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Oncology,,4.236,"METASTASES,NOMOGRAM,RISK,MULTICENTER,VALIDATION,TOOLS",ACTA ONCOLOGICA,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0284186X.2020.1736332?needAccess=true,

In this study, a smartphone-based hybrid system that fully automates the sperm morphological analysis is introduced with the aim of eliminating unwanted human factors. Proposed hybrid system consists of two progressive steps: automatic segmentation of possible sperm shapes and classification of normal/ab-normal sperms. In the segmentation step, clustering techniques with/without group sparsity approach were tested to extract region of interests from the images. Subsequently, a novel publicly available morphological sperm image data set, whose labels were identified by experts as non-sperm, normal and abnormal sperm, was created as the ground truths of classification step. In the classification step, conventional and ensemble machine learning methods were applied to domain-specific features that were extracted by using wavelet transform and descriptors. Additionally, as an alternative to conventional features, three deep neural network architectures, which can extract high-level features from raw images after using statistical learning, were employed to increase the proposed method's performance. The results show that, for the conventional features, the highest classification accuracies were achieved as 80.5% and 83.8% by using the wavelet- and descriptor-based features that were fed to the Support Vector Machines respectively. On the other hand, the Mobile-Net, which is a very convenient network for smartphones, achieved 87% accuracy. In the light of obtained results, it is seen that a fully automatic hybrid system, which uses the group sparsity to enhance segmentation performance and the Mobile-Net to obtain high-level robust features, can be an effective mobile solution for the sperm morphology analysis problem.","Infertility,Sperm morphology,Sperm abnormality classification,Convolution neural networks,Group sparsity,Discrete wavelet transform,Support vector machines",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,2.61,"COMPLEX,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,DEEP,NEURAL-NETWORKS,ACROSOME,INTEGRITY,GOLD-STANDARD,MORPHOLOGY,ARCHITECTURES,SEGMENTATION,ALGORITHMS,REDUCTION,TEXTURE",MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,,

Integration of these scanners in surgical workflows has the potential to enable rapid registration and augment preoperative imaging, in a practical and timely manner in the operating theatre. Previously, we have demonstrated the intraoperative feasibility of such scanners to capture anatomical surface information with high accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of automatically characterizing anatomical tissues from textural and spatial information captured by such scanners using machine learning. Assisted or automatic identification of relevant components of a captured scan is essential for effective integration of the technology in surgical workflow. Methods During a clinical study, 3D surface scans for seven total knee arthroplasty patients were collected, and textural and spatial features for cartilage, bone, and ligament tissue were collected and annotated. These features were used to train and evaluate machine learning models. As part of our preliminary preparation, three fresh-frozen knee cadaver specimens were also used where 3D surface scans with texture information were collected during different dissection stages. The resulting models were manually segmented to isolate texture information for muscles, tendon, cartilage, and bone. This information, and detailed labels from dissections, provided an in-depth, finely annotated dataset for building machine learning classifiers. Results For characterizing bone, cartilage, and ligament in the intraoperative surface models, random forest and neural network-based models achieved an accuracy of close to 80%, whereas an accuracy of close to 90% was obtained when only characterizing bone and cartilage. Average accuracy of 76-82% was reached for cadaver data in two-, three-, and four-class tissue separation. Conclusions The results of this project demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning methods to accurately classify multiple types of anatomical tissue. The ability to automatically characterize tissues in intraoperatively collected surface models would streamline the surgical workflow of using structured light scanners-paving the way to applications such as 3D documentation of surgery in addition to rapid registration and augmentation of preoperative imaging.","Intraoperative imaging,Structured light scanner,Surface scanning,Tissue classification",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,,"DOCUMENTATION,INJURIES",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

MD simulations studying the classical time evolution of a molecular system at atomic resolution are widely recognized in the fields of chemistry, material sciences, molecular biology and drug design; these simulations are one of the most common simulations on supercomputers. Next-generation supercomputers will have a dramatically higher performance than current systems, generating more data that needs to be analysed (e.g. in terms of number and length of MD trajectories). In the future, the coordination of data generation and analysis can no longer rely on manual, centralized analysis traditionally performed after the simulation is completed or on current data representations that have been defined for traditional visualization tools. Powerful data preparation phases (i.e. phases in which original row data is transformed to concise and still meaningful representations) will need to proceed data analysis phases. Here, we discuss three algorithms for transforming traditionally used molecular representations into concise and meaningful metadata representations. The transformations can be performed locally. The new metadata can be fed into machine learning methods for runtime in situ analysis of larger MD trajectories supported by high-performance computing.

The mentioned characterization is done through a segmentation process, facing several challenges due to the diversity in nodular shape, size, and texture, as well as the presence of adjacent structures. This paper tackles pulmonary nodule segmentation in computed tomography scans proposing three distinct methodologies. First, a conventional approach which applies the Sliding Band Filter (SBF) to estimate the filter's support points, matching the border coordinates. The remaining approaches are Deep Learning based, using the U-Net and a novel network called SegU-Net to achieve the same goal. Their performance is compared, as this work aims to identify the most promising tool to improve nodule characterization. All methodologies used 2653 nodules from the LIDC database, achieving a Dice score of 0.663, 0.830, and 0.823 for the SBF, U-Net and SegU-Net respectively. This way, the U-Net based models yield more identical results to the ground truth reference annotated by specialists, thus being a more reliable approach for the proposed exercise. The novel network revealed similar scores to the U-Net, while at the same time reducing computational cost and improving memory efficiency.

The study aims to automatically extract the self-learned features using an end-to-end learning CNN and compares the results with the conventional state-of-art and traditional computer-aided diagnosis system's performance. The architecture consists of eight layers: one input layer, three convolutional layers and three sub-sampling layers intercepted with batch normalization, ReLu and max-pooling for salient feature extraction, and one fully connected layer that uses softmax function connected to 3 neurons as output layer, classifying an input image into one of three classes categorized as nodules >= 3 mm as benign (low malignancy nodules), malignant (high malignancy nodules), and nodules < 3 mm and non-nodules >= 3 mm combined as non-cancerous. For the input layer, lung nodule CT images are acquired from the Lung Image Database Consortium public repository having 1018 cases. Images are pre-processed to uniquely segment the nodule region of interest (NROI) in correspondence to four radiologists' annotations and markings describing the coordinates and ground-truth values. A two-dimensional set of re-sampled images of size 52 x 52 pixels with random translation, rotation, and scaling corresponding to the NROI are generated as input samples. In addition, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are employed to generate additional images with similar characteristics as pulmonary nodules. CNNs are trained using images generated by GAN and are fine-tuned with actual input samples to differentiate and classify the lung nodules based on the classification strategy. The pre-trained and fine-tuned process upon the trained network's architecture results in aggregate probability scores for nodule detection reducing false positives.

Methods The reliability of metabolite quantification depends on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), linewidth, and degree of spectral overlap (DSO), and therefore knowledge about these factors may be utilized in measurement uncertainty estimation in deep learning-based(1)H-MRS. While SNR and linewidth are typically estimated from a representative singlet, DSO needs to be estimated metabolite-specifically. We developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capable of isolating target metabolite signal on simulated rat brain spectra at 9.4T, such that, in addition to metabolite content, the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) as a quantitative metric of DSO can be estimated directly from CNN-output for each metabolite. The CNN-predicted SBR was adjusted according to its pre-defined relationship to the ground-truth SBR by exploiting the big spectral data (N = 80 000), and used for measurement uncertainty estimation together with the SNR and linewidth from the CNN-input spectrum. The proposed method was tested first on the simulated spectra in comparison with LCModel and jMRUI and further on in vivo spectra. Results The proposed method outperformed LCModel and jMRUI in both quantitative accuracy and measurement uncertainty estimation. Using in vivo data, the metabolite concentrations from the proposed method were close to the reported ranges with the measurement uncertainty of glutamine, glutamate, myo-inositol, N-acetylaspartate, and Tau less than 10%. Conclusion The proposed method may be used for metabolite quantification with measurement uncertainty estimation in rat brain at 9.4T by exploiting the spectral isolation capability of the CNNs and the availability of big spectral data.","brain,deep learning,measurement uncertainty,metabolite quantification,proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"VIVO,H-1-NMR,SPECTROSCOPY,IN-VIVO,RAT-BRAIN,SPECTRA,QUALITY,LINE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,,

Usually, visual information is captured by a frame-based camera, converted into a digital format and processed afterwards using a machine-learning algorithm such as an artificial neural network (ANN)(1). The large amount of (mostly redundant) data passed through the entire signal chain, however, results in low frame rates and high power consumption. Various visual data preprocessing techniques have thus been developed(2-7) to increase the efficiency of the subsequent signal processing in an ANN. Here we demonstrate that an image sensor can itself constitute an ANN that can simultaneously sense and process optical images without latency. Our device is based on a reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor(8,9) photodiode(10-12) array, and the synaptic weights of the network are stored in a continuously tunable photoresponsivity matrix.

Although the prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer largely depends on a classification based on the tumor-lymph node metastasis staging system, patients at the same stage may have different clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the survival prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer using machine learning.
Settings and Design:
Original, retrospective.
Materials and Methods:
A total of 72 patients with a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer who received radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy were included in the study. The contribution of patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics to the survival prognosis was evaluated by machine learning using the following techniques: logistic regression, artificial neural network, XGBoost, support-vector clustering, random forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Results:
In the analysis of the data set, correlation analysis, and binary logistic regression analyses were applied. Of the 18 independent variables, 10 were found to be effective in predicting nasopharyngeal cancer-related mortality: age, weight loss, initial neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, initial lactate dehydrogenase, initial hemoglobin, radiotherapy duration, tumor diameter, number of concurrent chemotherapy cycles, and T and N stages. Gaussian Naive Bayes was determined as the best algorithm to evaluate the prognosis of machine learning techniques (accuracy rate: 88%, area under the curve score: 0.91, confidence interval: 0.68-1, sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 100%).
Conclusion:
Many factors affect prognosis in cancer, and machine learning algorithms can be used to determine which factors have a greater effect on survival prognosis, which then allows further research into these factors. In the current study, Gaussian Naive Bayes was identified as the best algorithm for the evaluation of prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer.","nasopharyngeal cancer,radiotherapy,prognosis,machine learning",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",Oncology,,2.66,"INTENSITY-MODULATED,RADIOTHERAPY,BARR-VIRUS,DNA,NEUTROPHIL-LYMPHOCYTE,RATIO,LACTATE-DEHYDROGENASE,LEVEL,LONG-TERM,SURVIVAL,POOR-PROGNOSIS,CARCINOMA,PREDICTS,ANEMIA",TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7066591?pdf=render,

We employ the Langevin algorithm to sample the posterior probability measure for the spiked mixed matrix-tensor model. The typical behavior of this algorithm is described by a system of integrodifferential equations that we call the Langevin state evolution, whose solution is compared with the one of the state evolution of approximate message passing (AMP). Our results show that, remarkably, the algorithmic threshold of the Langevin algorithm is suboptimal with respect to the one given by AMP. This phenomenon is due to the residual glassiness present in that region of parameters.

Methods Data from our multi-contrast acquisition were embedded into the variational network architecture where shared anatomical information is exchanged by mixing the input contrasts. Complementary k-space sampling across imaging contrasts and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding were used for data acquisition to improve the reconstruction at high accelerations. At 3T, our joint variational network approach across T1w, T2w and T2-FLAIR-weighted brain scans was tested for retrospective under-sampling at R = 6 (2D) and R = 4 x 4 (3D) acceleration. Prospective acceleration was also performed for 3D data where the combined acquisition time for whole brain coverage at 1 mm isotropic resolution across three contrasts was less than 3 min. Results Across all test datasets, our joint multi-contrast network better preserved fine anatomical details with reduced image-blurring when compared to the corresponding single-contrast reconstructions. Improvement in image quality was also obtained through complementary k-space sampling and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding where the synergistic combination yielded the overall best performance as evidenced by exemplary slices and quantitative error metrics. Conclusion By leveraging shared anatomical structures across the jointly reconstructed scans, our joint multi-contrast approach learnt more efficient regularizers, which helped to retain natural image appearance and avoid over-smoothing. When synergistically combined with advanced encoding techniques, the performance was further improved, enabling up toR = 16-fold acceleration with good image quality. This should help pave the way to very rapid high-resolution brain exams.","deep learning,Joint multi-contrast reconstruction,parallel imaging,Wave-CAIPI",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"WAVE-CAIPI,MOTION,CORRECTION,MRI,OPTIMIZATION,SENSE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/135944/2/mrm.28219.pdf,

The detection of epileptogenic region in brain is important for the detection of epilepsy disease. The signals from epileptogenic region in brain are focal signal and the signal from normal regions in brain is non-focal signal. Hence, the detection of focal signal is important for epilepsy disease detection. This paper proposes an automatic detection and diagnosis of EEG signals for epilepsy disease using soft computing approaches as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and neural networks (NN). In this paper, the features from decomposed coefficients as bias (B), weight feature (W), entropy(E), activity feature (AF), mobility feature (MF), complexity feature (CF), skewness (S) and kurtosis (K) are extracted for the classification of EEG signals into either focal or non-focal signals for epilepsy disease detection and diagnosis. The detection of focal signal is achieved by ANFIS classifier and the diagnosis of the severity levels in focal signal is achieved by NN classification approach.

Efforts are made to improve the visible light-stimulated plasticity by boosting the synaptic weight after optical neural activities. However, such modulation at the expense of increased initial synaptic weight before the stimuli still results in the limited plasticity. Here, instead of employing those inherent interfacial trap-induced effects that raise the activated synaptic weight, it is demonstrated that an interfacial modification to inhibit them can greatly reduce the initial synaptic weight. Hence, with the assistance of the charge-trapping memory effect, the initial and the activated synaptic weight can be modulated, leading to a significantly enhanced plasticity. Such enhancement is accomplished in a type of pentacene-based synaptic transistors in which a visible-light-triggered plasticity above 10(8)% (at 0 V gate voltage and -1 V source-drain voltage) can be achieved under a moderate optoelectronic stimulus. As a demonstration, long-term potentiation is implemented to showcase synaptic responses with high plasticity after repeated light-triggered neural activities, suggesting the proposed mechanism and design paradigm would be beneficial for future optical neuromorphic architectures.","history-dependent learning,optoelectronics,plasticity,synaptic transistors,synaptic weight modulation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,7.418,"LONG-TERM,POTENTIATION,PHOTOCURRENT,GENERATION,MEMORY,MECHANISMS,DEVICE",ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,,

Because the manual method is time-consuming and prone to observer variability, it is attractive to develop computer-aided and automated methods for BAA. In this paper, we present a fully automatic BAA method. To eliminate noise in a raw X-ray image, we start with using U-Net to precisely segment hand mask image from a raw X-ray image. Even though U-Net can perform the segmentation with high precision, it needs a bigger annotated dataset. To alleviate the annotation burden, we propose to use deep active learning (AL) to select unlabeled data samples with sufficient information intentionally. These samples are given to Oracle for annotation. After that, they are then used for subsequential training. In the beginning, only 300 data are manually annotated and then the improved U-Net within the AL framework can robustly segment all the 12611 images in RSNA dataset. The AL segmentation model achieved a Dice score at 0.95 in the annotated testing set. To optimize the learning process, we employ six off-the-shell deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with pretrained weights on ImageNet. We use them to extract features of preprocessed hand images with a transfer learning technique. In the end, a variety of ensemble regression algorithms are applied to perform BAA. Besides, we choose a specific CNN to extract features and explain why we select that CNN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved discrepancy between manual and predicted bone age of about 6.96 and 7.35 months for male and female cohorts, respectively, on the RSNA dataset. These accuracies are comparable to state-of-the-art performance.","RADIOGRAPHS,SYSTEM",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,"RADIOGRAPHS,SYSTEM",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7072110?pdf=render,

We describe a deep learning-based prototype for automated assessment of the CVS in white matter MS lesions using data from three different imaging centers. We retrospectively analyzed data from 3 T magnetic resonance images acquired on four scanners from two different vendors, including adults with MS (n = 42), MS mimics (n = 33, encompassing 12 distinct neurological diseases mimicking MS) and uncertain diagnosis (n = 5). Brain white matter lesions were manually segmented on FLAIR* images. Perivenular assessment was performed according to consensus guidelines and used as ground truth, yielding 539 CVS-positive (CVS+) and 448 CVS-negative (CVS-) lesions. A 3D convolutional neural network (""CVSnet"") was designed and trained on 47 datasets, keeping 33 for testing. FLAIR* lesion patches of CVS+/CVS- lesions were used for training and validation (n = 375/298) and for testing (n = 164/150). Performance was evaluated lesion-wise and subject-wise and compared with a state-of-the-art vesselness filtering approach through McNemar's test. The proposed CVSnet approached human performance, with lesion-wise median balanced accuracy of 81%, and subject-wise balanced accuracy of 89% on the validation set, and 91% on the test set. The process of CVS assessment, in previously manually segmented lesions, was similar to 600-fold faster using the proposed CVSnet compared with human visual assessment (test set: 4 seconds vs. 40 minutes). On the validation and test sets, the lesion-wise performance outperformed the vesselness filter method (P < 0.001). The proposed deep learning prototype shows promising performance in differentiating MS from its mimics. Our approach was evaluated using data from different hospitals, enabling larger multicenter trials to evaluate the benefit of introducing the CVS marker into MS diagnostic criteria.","Central vein sign,deep learning,MS mimics,multiple sclerosis",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Biophysics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Spectroscopy",,3.988,"WHITE-MATTER,LESIONS,MRI,DIAGNOSIS,PATHOLOGY,BRAIN",NMR IN BIOMEDICINE,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_16E178964567.P001/REF.pdf,

The method uses a large-particle flow cytometer to count individual seeds and sort them according to size, allowing an average of 12,000 seeds/hour to be processed. To achieve this high throughput, post harvested seeds are first separated from remaining plant material (dust and chaff) using a rapid sedimentation-based method. Then, classification algorithms are used to refine the separation process in silico. Accurate identification of all seeds in the samples was achieved, with relative errors below 2%. Conclusion The tests performed reveal that there is no single classification algorithm that performs best for all samples, so the recommended strategy is to train and use multiple algorithms and use the median predictions of seed size and number across all algorithms. To facilitate the use of this method, an R package (SeedSorter) that implements the methodology has been developed and made freely available. The method was validated with seed samples from several natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, but our analysis pipeline is applicable to any species with seed sizes smaller than 1.5 mm.","Machine learning,BioSorter,R package,Phenotyping,SeedSorter,Seed number,Seed size,Arabidopsis thaliana",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Plant Sciences",,5.312,"NATURAL,VARIATION,REPRODUCTION,MORPHOLOGY,ECOLOGY",PLANT METHODS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7053093,

These captured images are susceptible to low contrast, poor visibility, and color distortion, which is the reason for serious errors in digital image vision systems. Therefore, defogging research has material significance for practical applications. In this paper, image dehazing is regarded as a mathematical inversion and image restoration process on the basis of fog image degradation model. The global atmospheric light A can be approximately estimated by combining Gaussian low-pass filtering with the single-threshold segmentation and binary tree method. And a deep learning transmittance network is adopted to modify transmittance. Comparison experimental results show that our method is effective in dealing with thick fog, complex scenes and multicolor images. In addition, our method is superior to four other state-of-the-art defogging methods in visual impact, universality and running speed.

Methods Motion capture with electromyography (EMG) assessment was performed on 49 participants [healthy control (con) = 16, remission LBP (rmLBP) = 16, current LBP (LBP) = 17], whilst performing a low-load lifting task, to extract a total of 40 predictors (kinematic and electromyographic variables). Three statistical models were developed using functional data boosting (FDboost), for binary classification of LBP statuses (model 1: con vs. LBP; model 2: con vs. rmLBP; model 3: rmLBP vs. LBP). After removing collinear predictors (i.e. a correlation of > 0.7 with other predictors) and inclusion of the covariate sex, 31 predictors were included for fitting model 1, 31 predictors for model 2, and 32 predictors for model 3.
Results Seven EMG predictors were selected in model 1 (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] of 90.4%), nine predictors in model 2 (AUC of 91.2%), and seven predictors in model 3 (AUC of 96.7%). The most influential predictor was the biceps femoris muscle (peak beta = 0.047) in model 1, the deltoid muscle (peak beta = 0.052) in model 2, and the iliocostalis muscle (peak beta = 0.16) in model 3.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on the CISLs can improve radiologists' performance in the diagnosis of lung diseases. Since similarity measure is important for CAD, we propose a multi-level method to measure the similarity between the CISLs. The CISLs are characterized in the low-level visual scale, mid-level attribute scale, and high-level semantic scale, for a rich representation. The similarity at multiple levels is calculated and combined in a weighted sum form as the final similarity. The proposed multi-level similarity method is capable of computing the level-specific similarity and optimal cross-level complementary similarity. The effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure method is evaluated on a dataset of 511 lung CT images from clinical patients for CISLs retrieval. It can achieve about 80% precision and take only 3.6 ms for the retrieval process. The extensive comparative evaluations on the same datasets are conducted to validate the advantages on retrieval performance of our multi-level similarity measure over the single-level measure and the two-level similarity methods. The proposed method can have wide applications in radiology and decision support.

The initial convolutional layer of the change detection network with multiscale 3D filters was designed to extract spatial and spectral features of materials having different sizes; the layer exploits pre-trained weights and biases of semantic segmentation network trained on an open benchmark dataset. The 3D filter sizes were defined in a specialized way to extract spatial and spectral information, and the optimal size of the filter was determined using highly accurate semantic segmentation results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, binary change detection was performed on images obtained from multi-temporal Korea multipurpose satellite-3A.

In this paper, we classify breast tumor models of varying sizes and shapes using signals collected with a monostatic ultra-wideband radar microwave imaging prototype system with machine learning algorithms specifically tailored to the collected data.
Methods A database comprising 13 benign and 13 malignant tumor models with sizes between 13 and 40 mm was created using dielectrically representative tissue mimicking materials. These tumor models were placed inside two breast phantoms: a homogeneous breast phantom and a breast phantom with clusters of fibroglandular mimicking tissue, accounting for breast heterogeneity. The breast phantoms with tumors were imaged with a monostatic microwave imaging prototype system, over a 1-6 GHz frequency range. The classification of benign and malignant tumors embedded in the two breast phantoms was completed, and tumor classification was evaluated with Principal Component Analysis as a feature extraction method, and tuned Naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) as classifiers. We further study which antenna positions are better placed to classify tumors, discuss the feature extraction method and optimize classification algorithms, by tuning their hyperparameters, to improve sensitivity, specificity and the receiver operating characteristic curve, while ensuring maximum generalization and avoiding overfitting and data contamination. We also added a realistic synthetic skin response to the collected signals and examined its global effect on classification of benign vs malignant tumors.
Results In terms of global classification performance, kNN outperformed DT and NB machine learning classifiers, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.2% when classifying between benign and malignant tumor phantoms in a homogeneous breast phantom (both when the skin artifact is and is not considered).
Conclusions We experimentally classified tumor models as benign or malignant with a microwave imaging system, and we showed a methodology that can potentially assess the shape of breast tumors, which will give further insight into the correct diagnosis and staging of breast cancer.","breast tumor diagnosis,microwave imaging prototype system",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"CANCER,DETECTION,RADAR,CLASSIFIERS,BENIGN",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

With the technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. Possible means of application range from automated image reading and classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological applications in image processing and reconstruction.
In the context of tumor imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the whole body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor volume with overall survival.
In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special interest, if targeted treatment options might become available.
Technological approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET screening.
Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the description of possible future developments. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This is a consequence of the absence of a specific measure capable of quantifying the nociception level of the patients. Unlike existing proposals, this paper aims to evaluate the suitability of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) as a guidance variable to replicate the decisions made by the experts when a modification of the opioid infusion rate is required. To this end, different machine learning classifiers were trained with several sets of clinical features. Data for training were captured from 17 patients undergoing cholecystectomy surgery. Satisfactory results were obtained when including information about minimum values of ANI for predicting a change of dose. Specifically, a higher efficiency of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was observed compared with the situation in which the ANI index was not included: accuracy: 86.21% (83.62%87.93%), precision: 86.11% (83.78%-88.57%), recall: 91.18% (88.24%-91.18%), specificity: 79.17% (75%83.33%), AUC: 0.89 (0.87-0.90) and kappa index: 0.71 (0.66-0.75). The results of this research evidenced that including information about the minimum values of ANI together with the hemodynamic information outperformed the decisions made regarding only non-specific traditional signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, the analysis of the results showed that including the ANI monitor in the decision making process may anticipate a dose change to prevent hemodynamic events.

Research on magnetocaloric lanthanum manganites with near-room-temperature Curie temperature shows promising results for development of magnetic refrigeration devices. Chemical substitutions are one of the most effective methods to tune the magnetocaloric effect, represented by the maximum magnetic entropy change (MMEC), through the incorporation of various lanthanides, rare-earth elements, alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, transition metals, and other elements. Some theories based on lattice distortions and double-exchange interactions show that ionic radii of the dopants and final compositions correlate with the MMEC, but the correlations are generally limited to A-site substitutions and become less applicable to multi-doped manganites than single-doped ones. In this work, the Gaussian process regression model is developed as a machine learning tool to find statistical correlations between the MMEC and structural parameters among lanthanum manganites. More than 70 lattices, cubic, pseudocubic, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral, with the MMEC ranging from 0.65 J kg(-1) K-1 to 8.00 J kg(-1) K-1 under a field change of 5 T are explored for this purpose.

Left ventricular (LV) segmentation plays a key role in volumetric functional quantification of the heart. Conventional manual analysis is time-consuming and observer-dependent. Automated segmentation approaches are needed to improve the clinical workflow of cardiac functional quantification. Recently, deep-learning networks have shown promise for efficient LV segmentation. PURPOSE: The routinely used V-Net is a convolutional network that segments images by passing features from encoder to decoder. In this study, this method was advanced as DenseV-Net by replacing the convolutional block with a densely connected algorithm and dense calculations to alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, prevent exploding gradients, and to strengthen feature propagation. Thirty patients were scanned with a 3 Tesla MR imager. ECG-free, free-breathing, real-time cines were acquired with a balanced steady-state free precession technique. Linear regression and the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were performed to evaluate LV segmentation performance of the classic neural networks FCN, UNet, V-Net, and the proposed DenseV-net methods, using manual analysis as the reference. Slice-based LV function was compared among the four methods. Results: Thirty slices from eleven patients were randomly selected (each slice contained 73 images), and the LVs were segmented using manual analysis, UNet, FCN, V-Net, and the proposed DenseV-Net methods. A strong correlation of the left ventricular areas was observed between the proposed DenseV-Net network and manual segmentation (R = 0.92), with a mean DSC of 0.90 0.12. A weaker correlation was found between the routine V-Net, UNet, FCN, and manual segmentation methods (R = 0.77, 0.74, 0.76, respectively) with a lower mean DSC (0.85 0.13, 0.84 0.16, 0.79 0.17, respectively). Additionally, the proposed DenseV-Net method was strongly correlated with the manual analysis in slice-based LV function quantification compared with the state-of-art neural network methods V-Net, UNet, and FCN. Conclusion: The proposed DenseV-Net method outperforms the classic convolutional networks V-Net, UNet, and FCN in automated LV segmentation, providing a novel way for efficient heart functional quantification and the diagnosis of cardiac diseases using cine MRI.","Image segmentation,left ventricular segmentation,artificial neural networks,magnetic resonance cine imaging,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,,

This study follows from the fact that most of the analysis requires nuclei detection as the starting phase for getting an insight into the underlying biological process and further diagnosis. The proposed architecture consists of a switch normalization layer, convolution layers, and inception layers (concatenated 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolution and the hybrid of a max and Hartley spectral pooling layer) connected in the U-Net fashion for generating the image masks. This article also illustrates the model perception of image masks using activation maximization and filter map visualization techniques. A novel objective function segmentation loss is proposed based on the binary cross entropy, dice coefficient, and intersection over union loss functions. The intersection over union score, loss value, and pixel accuracy metrics evaluate the model over the KDSB18 dataset.

However, systematic approaches to doing so remain poorly established. Using mammography as an exemplar case, we use a series of experiments to demonstrate that deep learning (DL) techniques can, in principle, be used to train naive subjects to reliably detect certain diagnostic visual patterns of cancer in medical images. In the main experiment, subjects were required to learn to detect statistical visual patterns diagnostic of cancer in mammograms using only the mammograms and feedback provided following the subjects' response. We found not only that the subjects learned to perform the task at statistically significant levels, but also that their eye movements related to image scrutiny changed in a learning-dependent fashion. Two additional, smaller exploratory experiments suggested that allowing subjects to re-examine the mammogram in light of various items of diagnostic information may help further improve DL of the diagnostic patterns. Finally, a fourth small, exploratory experiment suggested that the image information learned was similar across subjects. Together, these results prove the principle that DL methodologies can be used to train nonprofessional subjects to reliably perform those aspects of medical image perception tasks that depend on visual pattern recognition expertise.

Instead, assessments of the state of the tip apex, which not only determines the resolution in any scanning probe technique, but can also generate a wide array of frustrating artefacts, are carried out in real time on the basis of a few lines of an image (and, typically, their associated line profiles.) The very small number of machine learning approaches to probe microscopy published to date, however, involve classifications based on full images. Given that data acquisition is the most time-consuming task during routine tip conditioning, automated methods are thus currently extremely slow in comparison to the tried-and-trusted strategies and heuristics used routinely by probe microscopists. Here, we explore various strategies by which different STM image classes (arising from changes in the tip state) can be correctly identified from partial scans. By employing a secondary temporal network and a rolling window of a small group of individual scanlines, we find that tip assessment is possible with a small fraction of a complete image. We achieve this with little-to-no performance penalty-or, indeed, markedly improved performance in some cases-and introduce a protocol to detect the state of the tip apex in real time.","STM,SPM,automated STM,convolutional neural networks,STM tip state",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,,"SCANNING-TUNNELING-MICROSCOPY,ATOMIC-FORCE,MICROSCOPY,REMOVAL,ROBUST",MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ab42ec,

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a framelet-pooling aided deep learning method for mitigating computational bundles caused by large dimensionality. By transforming high dimensional data into low dimensional components by filter banks and preserving detailed information, the proposed method aims to reduce the complexity of the neural network and computational costs significantly during the learning process.

As an alternative way, neural networks have been proposed for constitutive modeling, using either experiments or computational homogenization results for training. However, the application of this method to irreversible material behavior is not trivial.
The present contribution presents a hybrid methodology to embed neural networks into the established framework of rate-independent plasticity. Both, the yield function and the evolution equations of internal state variables are represented by neural networks.

We aim to anticipate these events earlier and more consistently so that staff can consider preemptive action.
Materials and Methods: We use a temporal convolutional network to encode longitudinal data and a feed-forward neural network to encode demographic data from 4713 ICU admissions in 2014-2018. For each hour of each admission, we predict events in the subsequent 1-6 hours. We compare performance with other models including a recurrent neural network.
Results: Our model performed similarly to the recurrent neural network for some events and outperformed it for others. This performance increase was more evident in a sensitivity analysis where the prediction timeframe was varied. Average positive predictive value (95% CI) was 0.786 (0.781-0.790) and 0.738 (0.732-0.743) for up- and down-titrating FiO(2), 0.574 (0.519-0.625) for extubation, 0.139 (0.117-0.162) for intubation, 0.533 (0.492-0.572) for starting noradrenaline, 0.441 (0.433-0.448) for fluid challenge, and 0.315 (0.282-0.352) for death.
Discussion: Events were better predicted where their important determinants were captured in structured electronic health data, and where they occurred in homogeneous circumstances.

Four machine learning algorithms were applied on 46 exposure variables in original and resampled training datasets built using 4 resampling methods. Predictive models were tested on internal validation data (n = 3172) and external validation data (n = 3000) prepared from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Predictors were assessed by odds ratios in logistic models and variable importance in others. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) prediabetes screening tool was the benchmark to compare model performance.
Results: Prediabetes prevalence was 23.43%. The CDC prediabetes screening tool produced 64.40% AUROC. Seven optimal (>= 70% AUROC) models identified 25 predictors including 4 potentially novel associations; 20 by both logistic and other nonlinear/ensemble models and 5 solely by the latter. All optimal models outperformed the CDC prediabetes screening tool (P<0.05).
Discussion: Combined use of feature selection and machine learning increased predictive performance outperforming the recommended screening tool. A range of predictors of prediabetes was identified.
Conclusion: This work demonstrated the value of combining feature selection with machine learning to identify a wide range of predictors that could enhance prediabetes prediction and clinical decision-making.","prediabetes,predictors,machine learning,feature selection,NHANES",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,5.178,"NEURAL-NETWORK,RISK,DIAGNOSIS,MODELS,TOOL",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647289,

This work demonstrates the added value of stratifying the types of organ dysfunction observed in patients who develop sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) in improving the ability to recognize patients at risk of sepsis from their EHR data.
Materials and Methods: Using an ICU dataset of 13 728 records, we identify clinically significant sepsis sub-populations with distinct organ dysfunction patterns. We perform classification experiments with random forest, gradient boost trees, and support vector machines, using the identified subpopulations to distinguish patients who develop sepsis in the ICU from those who do not.
Results: The classification results show that features selected using sepsis subpopulations as background knowledge yield a superior performance in distinguishing septic from non-septic patients regardless of the classification model used. The improved performance is especially pronounced in specificity, which is a current bottleneck in sepsis prediction machine learning models.
Conclusion: Our findings can steer machine learning efforts toward more personalized models for complex conditions including sepsis.","sepsis,sepsis subtypes,sepsis prediction,machine learning,artificial intelligence in medicine",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,5.178,"SEPTIC,SHOCK,MORTALITY,CLUSTERS,PHENOTYPES",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025363,

However, with the convenience of data generation from high throughput experiments and computations, how to extract useful knowledge from the massive data effectively is a challenging and urgent task at the moment. Machine learning, especially, the statistic ones, generally is a black box that lacks of explanations for learning results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a concept lattices algorithm to mine association rules with designated consequents (CLARDC). Through orderly structure concept lattice, all the concept nodes that containing target features and covering enough samples are searched downwards from the most abstract top concept node. The children concept nodes have more attributes than their parent ones, which is the key point that can differentiate concepts and extract rules. Through CLARDC algorithm, firstly, it can discover the positive or negative relationships between independent attributes and target ones from multi-dimensional data. Secondly, it can adjust threshold to select rules according to the actual situation. Thirdly, it can interpret result rules based on material knowledge. From diamond-like materials data experiment, it shows that CLARDC can extract two attributes ED and CAAM which deeply affect the band gap. Moreover, two attributes have different influence on band gap in different ranges. Also, it finds that different attributes have different influence on the band gap in different ranges. Finally, compared with Prism algorithm, rules obtained by CLARDC can describe the features in multiple perspectives, which are not only more understandable, but also more interactive.","Knowledge discovery,Concept lattice",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.145,"PREDICTION,SELECTION",MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS,,

This study predicted 90 m resolution spatial variations of sand, silt and clay contents at a national extent across China and at multiple depths 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-200 cm. We used 4579 soil profiles collected from a national soil series inventory conducted recently and currently available environmental covariates. The covariates characterized environmental factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation and soil conditions. We constructed random forest models and employed a parallel computing strategy for the predictions of soil texture fractions based on its relationship with the environmental factors. Quantile regression forest was used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions. Results showed that the predicted maps were much more accurate and detailed than the conventional linkage maps and the SoilGrids250m product, and could well represent spatial variation of soil texture across China. The relative accuracy improvement was around 245-370% relative to the linkage maps and 83-112% relative to the SoilGrids250m product with regard to the R-2, and it was around 24-26% and 14-19% respectively with regard to the RMSE. The wide range between 5% lower and 95% upper prediction limits may suggest that there was a substantial room to improve current predictions. Besides, we found that climate and terrain factors are major controllers for spatial patterns of soil texture in China. The heat and water-driven physical and chemical weathering and wind-driven erosion processes primarily shape the pattern of clay content. The terrain, wind and water-driven deposition, erosion and transportation sorting processes of soil particles primarily shape the pattern of silt. The findings provide clues for modeling future soil evolution and for national soil security management under the background of global and regional environmental changes.","Digital soil mapping,Machine learning,Large extent,Environmental factors,Uncertainty",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"CONTINUOUS,DEPTH,FUNCTIONS,ORGANIC-CARBON,MAP,UNCERTAINTY,WATER,GLOBALSOILMAP,PREDICTION,MATTER,AREA,STORAGE",GEODERMA,,

We present a new CNN architecture for brain tumor classification of three tumor types. The developed network is simpler than already-existing pre-trained networks, and it was tested on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images. The performance of the network was evaluated using four approaches: combinations of two 10-fold cross-validation methods and two databases. The generalization capability of the network was tested with one of the 10-fold methods, subject-wise cross-validation, and the improvement was tested by using an augmented image database. The best result for the 10-fold cross-validation method was obtained for the record-wise cross-validation for the augmented data set, and, in that case, the accuracy was 96.56%.

Definitive chemo-radiation (CRT) remains the best curative treatment option for non-metastatic cases in terms of local control, recurrence-free and progression-free survival. Still, despite overall good results, with 80% five-year survival, a subgroup of ASCC patients displays a high level of locoregional and/or metastatic recurrence rates, up to 35%, and may benefit from a more aggressive strategy. Beyond initial staging, there is no reliable marker to predict recurrence following CRT. Imaging, mostly positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bears an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of ASCC. The routine use of radiomics may enhance the quality of information derived from these modalities. It is thought that including data derived from radiomics into the input flow of machine learning algorithms may improve the prediction of recurrence. Although some studies have shown glimmers of hope, more data is needed before offering practitioners tools to identify high-risk patients and enable extensive clinical application, especially regarding the matters of imaging normalization, radiomics process standardization and access to larger patient databases with external validation in order to allow results extrapolation.

Several markers have been proposed to predict cardiovascular morbidity. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) marker is defined as the ratio between the ankle and the arm systolic blood pressures, and it is generally assessed through sphygmomanometers. An alternative tool for cardiovascular status assessment is Photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is a non-invasive optical technique that measures volumetric blood changes induced by pulse pressure propagation within arteries. However, PPG does not provide absolute pressure estimation, making assessment of cardiovascular status less direct. The capability of a multivariate data-driven approach to predict ABI from peculiar PPG features was investigated here. ABI was measured using a commercial instrument (Enverdis Vascular Explorer, VE-ABI), and it was then used for a General Linear Model estimation of ABI from multi-site PPG in a supervised learning framework (PPG-ABI). A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis allowed to investigate the capability of PPG-ABI to discriminate cardiovascular impairment as defined by VE-ABI. Findings suggested that ABI can be estimated form PPG (r = 0.79) and can identify pathological cardiovascular status (AUC = 0.85). The advantages of PPG are simplicity, speed and operator-independency, allowing extensive screening of cardiovascular status and associated cardiovascular risks.","photoplethysmography (PPG),ankle-brachial index (ABI),arterial stiffness,machine learning,cardiovascular risk",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"DISEASE,RISK,ASSOCIATIONS,MORTALITY,PLOTS",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/6/2137/pdf,

The emergence of personalized medicine requires quantification and analysis of differential characteristics of WML across different brain regions. Manual segmentation and analysis of WMLs is laborious and time-consuming; therefore, automated methods providing robust, reproducible, and fast WML segmentation and analysis are highly desirable. In this study, we tackled the segmentation problem as a voxel-based classification problem. We developed an ensemble of different classification models, including six models of support vector machine, trained on handcrafted and transfer learning features, and five models of Residual neural network, trained on varying window sizes. The output of these models was combined through majority-voting. A series of image processing operations was applied to remove false positives in a post-processing step. Moreover, images were mapped to a standard atlas template to quantify the spatial distribution of WMLs, and a radiomic analysis of all the lesions across different brain regions was carried out. The performance of the method on multi-institutional WML Segmentation Challenge dataset (n = 150) comprising T1-weighted and FLAIR images was >90% within data of each institution, multi-institutional data pooled together, and across-institution training-testing. Forty-five percent of lesions were found in the temporal lobe of the brain, and these lesions were easier to segment (95.67%) compared to lesions in other brain regions. Lesions in different brain regions were characterized by their differential characteristics of signal strength, size/shape, heterogeneity, and texture (p < 0.001). The proposed multimodal ensemble-based segmentation of WML showed effective performance across all scanners. Further, the radiomic characteristics of WMLs of different brain regions provide an in vivo portrait of phenotypic heterogeneity in WMLs, which points to the need for precision diagnostics and personalized treatment.","white matter hyperintensities,segmentation,support vector machines,ResNet,classification",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"FULLY-AUTOMATIC,SEGMENTATION,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,HYPERINTENSITIES,MRI,ABNORMALITIES,INFORMATION,IMAGES",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/6/1903/pdf,

Experienced doctors are required for the clinical diagnosis of bradykinesia, but sometimes they also miss subtle changes, especially in early stages of such disease. Therefore, developing auxiliary diagnostic methods that can automatically detect bradykinesia has received more and more attention. In this article, we employ a two-stage framework for bradykinesia recognition based on the video of patient movement. First, convolution neural networks are trained to localize keypoints in each video frame. These time-varying coordinates form motion trajectories that represent the whole movement. From the trajectory, we then propose novel measurements, namely stability, completeness, and self-similarity, to quantify different motor behaviors. We also propose a periodic motion model called PM-Net. An encoder-decoder structure is applied to learn a low dimensional representation of a motion process. The compressed motion process and quantified motor behaviors are combined as inputs to a fully-connected neural network. Different from the traditional means, our solution extends the application scenario outside the hospital and can be easily transplanted to conduct similar tasks. A commonly used clinical assessment is served as a case study.

Our hypothesis was that anatomical features between planning computed tomography (pCT) and pretreatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images could be used to predict the target, i.e. clinical target volume (CTV) shifts, with small errors. The pCT and daily CBCT images of 20 patients with prostate cancer were selected. The first 10 patients were employed for the development, and the second 10 patients for a validation test. The CTV position errors between the pCT and CBCT images were determined as reference CTV shifts (teacher data) after an automated bone-based registration. The anatomical features associated with rectum, bladder and prostate were calculated from the pCT and CBCT images. The features were fed as the input with the teacher data into five MLAs, i.e. three types of artificial neural networks, support vector regression (SVR) and random forests. Since the CTV shifts along the left-right direction were negligible, the MLAs were developed along the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions. The proposed framework was evaluated from the residual errors between the reference and predicted CTV shifts. In the validation test, the mean residual error with its standard deviation was 1.01 +/- 1.09 mm in SVR using only one feature (one click), which was associated with positional difference of the upper rectal wall. The results suggested that MLAs with anatomical features could be useful in prediction of CTV shifts for prostate radiotherapy.","prostate radiotherapy,cone beam computed tomography,anatomical features,target shifts,machine learning",Article; Proceedings Paper,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Oncology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"BAYESIAN,REGULARIZATION,RADIATION-THERAPY,TOMOGRAPHY,AGREEMENT,BLADDER,RECTUM",JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7246080?pdf=render,

However, quickly grasping the essence of a given patent is difficult as they typically are very long and written in a rather inaccessible style. These essential information, especially the invention itself and the experimental part of the invention, are usually contained in the description section. However, in many patents the description parts are neither annotated nor easily detectable. Here, we describe our novel PatSeg method for patent segmentation, which aims at automatically and directly identifying the most important parts of a patent. PatSeg uses a two-step approach, where a patent is first segmented into text blocks in an unsupervised fashion followed by a supervised classification step for each identified segment. In contrast to previous work, PatSeg uses semantic word embeddings in both phases and applies a sequential learning algorithm for the second step. These modifications lead to, on average, an improvement of 9.47% (8.78%, 9.00%) in terms of F1-score (precision, recall) and 7.29 in terms of accuracy in comparison to a baseline, as evaluated on two novel and manually segmented gold standard patent corpora.

Metasurfaces are versatile, novel platforms for manipulating the scattering, color, phase, or intensity of light. Currently, one of the typical approaches for designing a metasurface is to optimize one or two variables among a vast number of fixed parameters, such as various materials' properties and coupling effects, as well as the geometrical parameters. Ideally, this would require multidimensional space optimization through direct numerical simulations. Recently, an alternative, popular approach allows for reducing the computational cost significantly based on a deep-learning-assisted method. We utilize a deep-learning approach for obtaining high-quality factor (high-Q) resonances with desired characteristics, such as linewidth, amplitude, and spectral position. We exploit such high-Q resonances for enhancedlight-matter interaction in nonlinear optical metasurfaces and optomechanical vibrations, simultaneously. We demonstrate that optimized metasurfaces achieve up to 400-fold enhancement of the third-harmonic generation; at the same time, they also contribute to 100-fold enhancement of the amplitude of optomechanical vibrations. This approach can be further used to realize structures with unconventional scattering responses.","machine learning,dielectric nanostructures,Fano resonance,third-harmonic generation,optoacoustics",Article,"SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98225 USA",Optics,,,"3RD,HARMONIC-GENERATION,2ND-HARMONIC,GENERATION,INVERSE,DESIGN,PLASMONIC,NANOSTRUCTURES,NONLINEAR,RESPONSE,FANO,RESONANCES,BOUND-STATES,METASURFACES,MODES,NANOPARTICLE",ADVANCED PHOTONICS,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/40830/1/1354971_a1178_Rahmani.pdf,

The current imaging methods have modest sensitivities and specificities. This study aimed to evaluate skin infrared thermal (IRT) imaging as a diagnostic adjunct for acute appendicitis in adults.
Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in 51 patients with appendicitis, 20.
with abdominal pain (no appendicitis) and 51 healthy controls. Temperature of the skin overlying abdominal lower quadrants, right (RLQ) and left (LLQ), were recorded and compared between groups. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified which parameters discriminated between groups and compared the diagnostic accuracy of IRT to the final diagnosis.
Results: RLQ temperature > 34 degrees C discriminate healthy controls and patients with acute abdomen; a delta > 0.35 degrees C in RLQ vs LLQ discriminate patients with and without appendicitis. Compared to the ultrasound-based diagnosis, IRT has a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 56% to diagnose appendicitis.
Conclusions: IRT could be an adjunct tool in the diagnosis of appendicitis in settings with limited resources. Further research is needed to confirm and translate our results into clinical practice.","Appendicitis,Acute abdomen,Infrared imaging,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,2.581,"HUMAN,SKIN,DIAGNOSIS,APPENDECTOMY,ADULTS,RISK",INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY,,
