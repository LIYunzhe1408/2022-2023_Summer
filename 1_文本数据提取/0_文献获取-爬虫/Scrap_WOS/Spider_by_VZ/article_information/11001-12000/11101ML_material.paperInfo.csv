Herein, we introduce four new descriptors that can be derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and which are able to predict supramolecular gelation in both water and organic solvents. Their predictive ability was demonstrated via two separate machine learning techniques, a decision tree and an artificial neural network, with a dataset composed of urea-based gelators. Owing to the physical relevance of these descriptors to the supramolecular gelation process, their use could be conceptualized to other classes of supramolecular gelators and hence steer their design.","COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTION,APPLICABILITY DOMAIN,TRAINING SET,FORCE-FIELD,GELATORS,UREA,SOLUBILITY,VALIDATION,CHEMISTRY,ACCURACY",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",Chemistry,,9.658,"COMPUTATIONAL,PREDICTION,APPLICABILITY,DOMAIN,TRAINING,SET,FORCE-FIELD,GELATORS,UREA,SOLUBILITY,VALIDATION,CHEMISTRY,ACCURACY",CHEMICAL SCIENCE,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2020/sc/d0sc00129e,

This paper assesses research outcomes for perovskite materials in two-step thermochemical cycles. Experimental, computational and thermodynamic studies are summarized and critically discussed, identifying key attributes for future research. In addition to the critical review, a fast method for the classification of effective thermochemical properties (oxygen vacancy formation enthalpy and entropy) in a wide range of operational temperatures is provided. These properties together with a high-grade of sintering resistance and fast kinetics are the main characteristics required to maximize the solar-to-fuel efficiency of the process. The discovery of optimum material compositions for this application could be effectively achieved by a combination of machine learning, DFT, experimental testing and system modelling, and will require an extensive international research effort. If successful, this could lead to the ultimate development and practical application of thermochemical cycles for fuel production.

To make the lower extremity exoskeleton more flexible, it is necessary to identify various motion intentions of the lower limbs of the human body. Although more sEMG sensors can be used to identify more lower limb motion intention, with the increase in the number of sensors, more and more data need to be processed. In the process of human motion, the collected sEMG signal is easy to be interfered with noise. To improve the practicality of the lower extremity exoskeleton robot, this paper proposed a wavelet packet transform- (WPT-) based sliding window difference average filtering feature extract algorithm and the unscented Kalman neural network (UKFNN) recognition algorithm. We established an sEMG energy feature model, using a sliding window difference average filtering method to suppress noise interference and extracted stable feature values and using UKF filtering to optimize the neural network weights to improve the adaptability and accuracy of the recognition model. In this paper, we collected the sEMG signals of three muscles to identify six lower limb motion intentions. The average accuracy of 94.83% is proposed in this paper. Experiments show that the algorithm improves the accuracy and anti-interference of motion intention recognition of lower limb sEMG signals. The algorithm is superior to the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) recognition algorithm in the lower limb motion intention recognition and proves the effectiveness, novelty, and reliability of the method in this paper.","EMG SIGNAL,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,COMPONENT ANALYSIS,JOINT ANGLE,CLASSIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,DIMENSION",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mathematics",,1.27,"EMG,SIGNAL,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,JOINT,ANGLE,CLASSIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,DIMENSION",MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/5684812.pdf,

Incorporating new bio-reinforcements into composites can contribute to using agricultural wastes and creating tougher and more reliable materials. Nevertheless, the huge number of possible natural material combinations works against finding optimal composite designs. Here, machine learning was employed to effectively predict fracture toughness properties of multiscale bio-nano-composites. Charpy impact tests were conducted on composites with various combinations of two new bio fillers, pistachio shell powders, and fractal date seed particles, as well as nano-clays and short latania fibers, all which reinforce a poly(propylene)/ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer matrix. The measured energy absorptions obtained were used to calculate strain energy release rates as a fracture toughness parameter using linear elastic fracture mechanics and finite element analysis approaches. Despite the limited number of training data obtained from these impact tests and finite element analysis, the machine learning results were accurate for prediction and optimal design. This study applied the decision tree regressor and adaptive boosting regressor machine learning methods in contrast to the K-nearest neighbor regressor machine learning approach used in our previous study for heat deflection temperature predictions.

However, given the complex nature of medical datasets due to the presence of intra-class variability and heterogeneity, the use of complex DL models might not give the optimal performance up to the level which is suitable for assisting pathologists. Therefore, ensemble DL methods with the scope of including domain agnostic handcrafted Features (HC-F) inspired this work. We have, through experiments, tried to highlight that a single DL network (domain-specific or state of the art pre-trained models) cannot be directly used as the base model without proper analysis with the relevant dataset. We have used F1-measure, Precision, Recall, AUC, and Cross-Entropy Loss to analyse the performance of our approaches.

Rare human brains can fully grasp the deep TCM knowledge derived from a tremendous amount of experience. In this big data era, a big electronic brain might be competent via deep learning techniques.

It used to be a challenge to analyze the heterogeneous data by the computer-aided system until the advances of the powerful deep learning tools. We propose a multimodal deep learning framework to mimic a TCM practitioner to diagnose a patient on the basis of multimodal perceptions of see, listen, smell, ask, and touch. The framework learns common representations from various high-dimensional sensory data, and fuse the information for final classification. We propose to use conceptual alignment deep neural networks to embed prior knowledge and obtain interpretable latent representations. We implement a multimodal deep architecture to process tongue image and description text data for TCM diagnosis.

8,Multi-atlas-based auto-segmentation for prostatic urethra using novel prediction of deformable image registration accuracy,47,7,3023-3031,"Takagi Hisamichi,Kadoya Noriyuki,Kajikawa Tomohiro,Tanaka Shohei,Takayama Yoshiki,Chiba Takahito,Ito Kengo,Dobashi Suguru,Takeda Ken,Jingu Keiichi","Takagi H,Kadoya N,Kajikawa T,Tanaka S,Takayama Y,Chiba T,Ito K,Dobashi S,Takeda K,Jingu K",Kadoya N,10.1002/mp.14154,Tohoku University,"Purpose Accurate identification of the prostatic urethra and bladder can help determine dosing and evaluate urinary toxicity during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning in patients with localized prostate cancer. However, it is challenging to locate the prostatic urethra in planning computed tomography (pCT). In the present study, we developed a multiatlas-based auto-segmentation method for prostatic urethra identification using deformable image registration accuracy prediction with machine learning (ML) and assessed its feasibility.
Methods We examined 120 patients with prostate cancer treated with IMRT. All patients underwent temporary urinary catheter placement for identification and contouring of the prostatic urethra in pCT images (ground truth). Our method comprises the following three steps: (a) select four atlas datasets from the atlas datasets using the deformable image registration (DIR) accuracy prediction model, (b) deform them by structure-based DIR, (3) and propagate urethra contour using displacement vector field calculated by the DIR. In (a), for identifying suitable datasets, we used the trained support vector machine regression (SVR) model and five feature descriptors (e.g., prostate volume) to increase DIR accuracy. This method was trained/validated using 100 patients and performance was evaluated within an independent test set of 20 patients. Fivefold cross-validation was used to optimize the hype parameters of the DIR accuracy prediction model. We assessed the accuracy of our method by comparing it with those of two others: Acostas method-based patient selection (previous study method, by Acosta et al.), and the Waterman's method (defines the prostatic urethra based on the center of the prostate, by Waterman et al.). We used the centerlines distance (CLD) between the ground truth and the predicted prostatic urethra as the evaluation index.
Results The CLD in the entire prostatic urethra was 2.09 +/- 0.89 mm (our proposed method), 2.77 +/- 0.99 mm (Acosta et al., P = 0.022), and 3.47 +/- 1.19 mm (Waterman et al., P < 0.001); our proposed method showed the highest accuracy. In segmented CLD, CLD in the top 1/3 segment was highly improved from that of Waterman et.al. and was slightly improved from that of Acosta et.al., with results of 2.49 +/- 1.78 mm (our proposed method), 2.95 +/- 1.75 mm (Acosta et al., P = 0.42), and 5.76 +/- 3.09 mm (Waterman et al., P < 0.001).
Conclusions We developed a DIR accuracy prediction model-based multiatlas-based auto-segmentation method for prostatic urethra identification. Our method identified prostatic urethra with mean error of 2.09 mm, likely due to combined effects of SVR model employment in patient selection, modified atlas dataset characteristics and DIR algorithm. Our method has potential utility in prostate cancer IMRT and can replace use of temporary indwelling urinary catheters.","auto-segmentation,deformable image registration,machine learning,prostate cancer,radiotherapy",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"MODULATED,RADIATION-THERAPY,AUTOMATIC,SEGMENTATION,CONFORMAL,RADIOTHERAPY,DOSE,DISTRIBUTION,CANCER,SELECTION,IMRT,BRACHYTHERAPY",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Although trained and evaluated on different databases, impressive results have been achieved in existing face anti-spoofing techniques, but biometric authentication is a very significant problem as imposters are using lots of reconstructed samples or fake synthetic material or structure that can be used for various attack purposes. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, this paper explains the security for face anti-spoofing detection using linear discriminant analysis and validates the results by calculating HTER and accuracy on different databases (i.e., REPLAY ATTACK and CASIA).

The proposed methods tested on a set of state-of-the-art anti-spoofing features for the face mode gives a very low degree of complexity as 26 general image quality measures are applied to differentiate among legitimate and imposter samples.

A further challenge is real-time and accurate tracking of treatment effect, e.g., radiotherapy. Here, Pd-Au synthetic alloys are reported for mass-spectrometry-based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. A core-shell structure is designed using magnetic core particles to support Pd-Au alloys on the surface. Optimized synthetic alloys enhance the laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are differentiated from healthy controls with average diagnostic sensitivity of 94.0%, specificity of 85.7%, and accuracy of 89.9%, by machine learning of metabolic fingerprinting. Furthermore, the radiotherapy process of patients is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes.

However, despite many successful cases in which HTS led to the novel discovery, currently, the major bottleneck in HTS is a large computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) calculations that scale cubically with system size, limiting the chemical space that can be explored. The present work aims at addressing this computational burden of HTS by presenting a machine learning (ML) framework that can efficiently explore the chemical space. Our model is built upon an existing crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) to obtain formation energy of a crystal structure but is modified to allow uncertainty quantification for each prediction using the hyperbolic tangent activation function and dropout algorithm (CGCNN-HD). The uncertainty quantification is particularly important since typical usage of CGCNN (due to the lack of gradient implementation) does not involve structural relaxation which could cause substantial prediction errors. The proposed method is benchmarked against an existing application that identified promising photoanode material among the >7,000 hypothetical Mg-Mn-O ternary compounds using all DFT-HTS. In our approach, we perform the approximate HTS using CGCNN-HD and refine the results using full DFT for those selected (denoted as ML/DFT-HTS). The proposed hybrid model reduces the required DFT calculations by a factor of >50 compared to the previous DFT-HTS in making the same discovery of Mg2MnO4, experimentally validated new photoanode material. Further analysis demonstrates that the addition of HD components with uncertainty measures in the CGCNN-HD model increased the discoverability of promising materials relative to all DFT-HTS from 30% (CGCNN) to 68% (CGCNN-HD). The present ML/DFT-HTS with uncertainty quantification can thus be a fast alternative to DFT-HTS for efficient exploration of the vast chemical space.","NEURAL-NETWORKS,PREDICTION,STABILITY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Chemistry,Computer Science",,5.39,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,PREDICTION,STABILITY",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING,,

First, a cost function with respect to the chamber's earth pressure is given in light of Bellman's principle. Then, based on back propagation neural networks (BPNN), the action network, model network and critic network are established that compose the DHP controller. The networks' weights are updated through the gradient descent algorithm. By minimizing the cost function, the action network utilizes the critic network's error to optimize the control variables, so that the optimal advance speed, cutter head torque, cutter head speed, total thrust and screw conveyor speed are obtained.

Such automatic labelling of radiographs could represent a step towards global automatic radiological analysis. Methods Seven hundred and ninety-six frontal radiographies of adolescents were collected (84 patients wearing a brace, 325 with a spinal implant and 387 reference images with no treatment). The dataset was augmented to a total of 2096 images. A classification model was built, composed by a forward convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a discriminant analysis; the output was a probability for a given image to contain a brace, a spinal implant or none. The model was validated with a stratified tenfold cross-validation procedure. Performance was estimated by calculating the average accuracy. Results 98.3% of the radiographs were correctly classified as either reference, brace or implant, excluding 2.0% unclassified images. 99.7% of brace radiographs were correctly detected, while most of the errors occurred in the reference group (i.e. 2.1% of reference images were wrongly classified). Conclusion The proposed classification model, the originality of which is the coupling of a CNN with discriminant analysis, can be used to automatically label radiographs for the presence of scoliosis treatment. This information is usually missing from DICOM metadata, so such method could facilitate the use of large databases.

Here, we develop an alternative virtual-screening process via ensemble-based machine learning with one handcrafted and two generic descriptors to maximize the inference ability even using a small training dataset. A joint representation with the three descriptors translates the physical and chemical properties of a material as well as its underlying short- and long-range atomic structures to describe a multifaceted perspective of the material. As an application, the ensemble-scope descriptor learning model was trained with only 29 entries in the training dataset, and it selected potential oxygen-ion conductors from 13,384 oxides in the inorganic crystal structure database.

Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment are critical to avoid high morbidity and mortality rates, yet PE remains among the diagnoses most frequently missed or delayed. In this study, we developed a deep learning model-PENet, to automatically detect PE on volumetric CTPA scans as an end-to-end solution for this purpose. The PENet is a 77-layer 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on the Kinetics-600 dataset and fine-tuned on a retrospective CTPA dataset collected from a single academic institution. The PENet model performance was evaluated in detecting PE on data from two different institutions: one as a hold-out dataset from the same institution as the training data and a second collected from an external institution to evaluate model generalizability to an unrelated population dataset. PENet achieved an AUROC of 0.84 [0.82-0.87] on detecting PE on the hold out internal test set and 0.85 [0.81-0.88] on external dataset. PENet also outperformed current state-of-the-art 3D CNN models. The results represent successful application of an end-to-end 3D CNN model for the complex task of PE diagnosis without requiring computationally intensive and time consuming preprocessing and demonstrates sustained performance on data from an external institution.

Recently available data on large-scale cancer cell line dependency allow a systematic assessment of the predictive power of diverse molecular features; however, the protein expression data have not been rigorously evaluated. By using the protein expression data generated by reverse-phase protein arrays, we aimed to assess their predictive power in identifying cancer dependencies and to develop a related analytic tool for community use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS By using a machine learning schema, we conducted an analysis of feature importance based on cancer dependency and multiomic data from the DepMap and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia projects. We assessed the consistency of cancer dependency data between CRISPR/Cas9 and short hairpin RNA-mediated perturbation platforms. For a fair comparison, we focused on a set of genes with robust dependency data and four available expression-related features (copy number alteration, DNA methylation, messenger RNA expression, and protein expression) and performed the same-gene predictions of the cancer dependency using different molecular features.
RESULTS For the genes surveyed, we observed that the protein expression data contained substantial predictive power for cancer dependencies, and they were the best predictive feature for the CRISPR/Cas9-based dependency data. We also developed a user-friendly protein-dependency analytic module and integrated it with The Cancer Proteome Atlas; this module allows researchers to explore and analyze our results intuitively.
CONCLUSION This study provides a systematic assessment for predicting cancer dependencies of cell lines from different expression-related features of a gene. Our results suggest that protein expression data are a highly valuable information resource for understanding tumor vulnerabilities and identifying therapeutic opportunities.

Its prevalence causes a high healthcare expenditure. Acne healthcare costs and effects on individuals' quality of life lead to the need of analysing current acne evaluation, treatment and monitoring methods.

That is the reason why the development of new computer-assisted techniques is needed in order to automatically count the acne lesions.
Materials and Methods Using the fluorescence images, a segmentation algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.
Results A new counting tool has been obtained that provides a form of objective evaluation of acne vulgaris disease. The effectiveness of the application of the segmentation method is more than 90%, being valid for the follow-up and diagnosis of injuries.

While visual assessment is the most established means of evaluating burns globally, specialised dermatologists are not readily available in most locations and assessment is highly subjective. The use of other technical devices such as Laser Doppler Imaging is highly expensive while rate of occurrences is high in low- and middle-income countries. These necessitate the need for robust and cost-effective assessment techniques thereby acting as an affordable alternative to human expertise. Method In this paper, we present a technique to discriminate skin burns using deep transfer learning. This is due to deficient datasets to train a model from scratch, in which two dense and a classification layers were added to replace the existing top layers of pre-trained ResNet50 model. Results The proposed study was able to discriminate between burns and healthy skin in both ethnic subjects (Caucasians and Africans). We present an extensive analysis of the effect of using both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets when training a machine learning algorithm. The findings show that using homogenous dataset during training process produces a biased diagnostic model towards minor racial subjects while using heterogeneous datasets produce a robust diagnostic model. Recognition accuracy of up to 97.1% and 99.3% using African and Caucasian datasets respectively were achieved.

For translation to such applications, these devices must first demonstrate robust performance with high transfer efficiencies over extended distances. Here, we report the optimization of FRET in a 6-helix DNA origami architecture supporting a 14-dye site system that contains a central 10-dye homogeneous FRET (HomoFRET) relay span and overall extends over 29 nm in length. Varying the dye density by controlling their presence or absence across all of the individually addressable sites presented an incredibly large optimization space (1024 HomoFRET and 16 384 total permutations). High-throughput experiments, with over 500 measurements of DNA templates assembled in parallel, allowed for the study of HomoFRET transfer as a function of fluorophore density and arrangement. Transfer within solution-phase MPWs initially obtained with steady-state spectroscopy experiments revealed values only reaching -1% efficiency. Extensive photophysical characterization, utilizing six different spectroscopic techniques and 11 total methodologies, determined that the diminished FRET efficiency of each individual component step is the principal cause of the limited transfer in solution. Monte Carlo and machine-learning methods provided additional insights into design optimization. A representative MPW set selected based on the previous findings was subsequently characterized in film deposition and also under cryogenic conditions. Under these improved conditions, selected MPWs demonstrated 59 +/- 6% energy transport efficiency over a length of 29 nm; this is similar to 25% longer and 10-fold more efficient than the previously reported optimized DNA MPWs.","molecular photonic wires,DNA nanotechnology,DNA origami,energy transfer,homogenous FRET,machine learning",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,5.1,"QUANTITATIVE,FRET,FLUORESCENCE,DYNAMICS,ABSORPTION,DEPENDENCE,EFFICIENCY,MODEL",ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS,,

As an alternative approach, we demonstrate how structure alone can be used to guide assignment of ground-state spin from experimentally determined crystal structures of transition-metal complexes. We first identify the limits of distance-based heuristics from distributions of metal-ligand bond lengths of over 2000 unique mononuclear Fe(II)/Fe(III) transition-metal complexes. To overcome these limits, we employ artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict spin-state-dependent metal-ligand bond lengths and classify experimental ground-state spins based on agreement of experimental structures with the ANN predictions. Although the ANN is trained on hybrid density functional theory data, we exploit the method-insensitivity of geometric properties to enable assignment of ground states for the majority (ca. 80-90%) of structures. We demonstrate the utility of the ANN by data-mining the literature for spincrossover (SCO) complexes, which have experimentally observed temperature-dependent geometric structure changes, by correctly assigning almost all (>95%) spin states in the 46 Fe(II) SCO complex set.

Recently, the rise in the incidences of thyroid cancer worldwide renders it to be the sixth most common cancer among women. Commonly, Fine Needle Aspiration biopsy predominantly facilitates the diagnosis of the nature of thyroid nodules. However, it is inconsiderable in determining the tumor's state, i.e., benign or malignant. This study aims to identify the key RNA transcripts that can segregate the early and late-stage samples of Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA) using RNA expression profiles.
Materials and methods
In this study, we used the THCA RNA-Seq dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas, consisting of 500 cancer and 58 normal (adjacent non-tumorous) samples obtained from the Genomics Data Commons (GDC) data portal. This dataset was dissected to identify key RNA expression features using various feature selection techniques. Subsequently, samples were classified based on selected features employing different machine learning algorithms.
Results
Single gene ranking based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curve identified the DCN transcript that can classify the early-stage samples from late-stage samples with 0.66 AUROC. To further improve the performance, we identified a panel of 36 RNA transcripts that achieved F1 score of 0.75 with 0.73 AUROC (95% CI: 0.62-0.84) on the validation dataset. Moreover, prediction models based on 18-features from this panel correctly predicted 75% of the samples of the external validation dataset. In addition, the multiclass model classified normal, early, and late-stage samples with AUROC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84-1), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.85) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61-0.83) on the validation dataset. Besides, a five protein-coding transcripts panel was also recognized, which segregated cancer and normal samples in the validation dataset with F1 score of 0.97 and 0.99 AUROC (95% CI: 0.91-1).
Conclusion
We identified 36 important RNA transcripts whose expression segregated early and late-stage samples with reasonable accuracy.

First, the modal testing was conducted on the fabricated fiberglass/foam core sandwich specimens, in the intact and damaged states, and the natural frequencies were extracted. Finite element modeling and inverse eigensensitivity-based model updating of the intact and damaged sandwich structures were conducted and the parameters of the models were identified. Afterward, the updated finite element models were employed to generate a large dataset of the first five harmonic frequencies of the damaged sandwich structures with different damage sizes and locations. This dataset was adopted to train the machine learning models for detection, localization, and size estimation of the core cracking and skin/core debonding damages. A multilayer perceptron neural network classification model was used for detection of types of damages and also a multilayer perceptron neural network regression model was fitted to the dataset for automatically estimation of the locations and dimensions of damages. This intelligent system of damage quantification was also used to make predictions on real damaged specimens not seen by the system. The results indicated that the extracted natural frequencies from the accurate finite element model, in coordination with the experimental data, and using the artificial neural networks can provide an effective system for nondestructive evaluation of foam core sandwich structures.","Sandwich composites,damage,natural frequency,finite element model updating,artificial neural network,nondestructive evaluation",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Engineering,,1.606,"ACOUSTIC-EMISSION,DELAMINATION,DETECTION,MODAL-ANALYSIS,IMPACT,DAMAGE,IDENTIFICATION,CLASSIFICATION,PARAMETERS,ENERGY",PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,,

Here, a machine-learningassisted composition space approach was applied to synthesize the missing M = Ti, Zr members of the Delta,Lambda-[Cu(bpy)(2)(H2O)](2)[MF6](2)center dot 3H(2)O (M = Ti, Zr, Hf; bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) family (space group: Pna21). In each (CuO, MO2)/bpy/HF(aq) (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) system, the polar noncentrosymmetric racemate (M-NCS) forms in competition with a centrosymmetric one-dimensional chain compound (M-CS) based on alternating Cu(bpy)(H2O)(2)(2+) and MF62- basic building units (space groups: Ti-CS (Pnma), Zr-CS (P1<overline>), Hf-CS (P2/n)). Machine learning models were trained on reaction parameters to gain unbiased insight into the underlying statistical trends in each composition space. A human-interpretable decision tree shows that phase selection is driven primarily by the bpy:CuO molar ratio for reactions containing Zr or Hf, and predicts that formation of the Ti-NCS compound requires that the amount of HF present be decreased to raise the pH, which we verified experimentally. Predictive leave-one-metal-out (LOO) models further confirm that behavior in the Ti system is distinct from that of the Zr and Hf systems. The chemical origin of this distinction was probed via fluorine K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Pre-edge features in the F1s X-ray absorption spectra reveal the strong ligand-to-metal p bonding between Ti(3d-t(2g)) and F(2p) states that distinguishes the TiF62- anion from the ZrF62- and HfF62- anions.","RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY,OF-CENTER DISTORTIONS,COMPOSITION SPACE,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,NONCENTROSYMMETRIC POLAR,DIRECTED SYNTHESIS,EDGE,SPECTRA,THERMOMETER,COMPLEXES",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,15.801,"RAY-ABSORPTION,SPECTROSCOPY,OF-CENTER,DISTORTIONS,COMPOSITION,SPACE,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,NONCENTROSYMMETRIC,POLAR,DIRECTED,SYNTHESIS,EDGE,SPECTRA,THERMOMETER,COMPLEXES",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,,

Materials and methods This paper aims to build statistical machine learning models to investigate the efficiency of spectral data for comprehensive evaluation of the soil quality indicators. Seventeen physical and chemical properties were measured using standard methods as indicators of soil quality. Soil samples were scanned in the laboratory in the vis-NIR range (350-2500 nm), the calibration set of 31 samples and the validation set of 13 samples for cross-validation and independent validation; twenty-four preprocessing methods were tested to improve predictions, and a partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to predict soil quality indicators. Results and discussion Comparing model indices, the model constructed based on the PLSR machine learning method has a good predictive power (R-2 > 0.9, ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) > 3.0). For physical and chemical properties, the bulk density (BD, R-2 = 0.97, RPD = 5.90), soil organic matter (SOM, R-2 = 0.98, RPD = 8.56), pH (R-2 = 0.95, RPD = 4.40), and TN (R-2 = 0.98, RPD = 6.67) concentration were predicted. This indicates that the method is suitable for the prediction of these soil elements in this study area. For the heavy properties, except for Mn, Zn, Cd, and As, the other five heavy metal concentrations were well predicted. It can be seen that the prediction ability of the construction model is Hg, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu in order of superiority to inferiority.

In this regard, computational methods that attempt to model LIBs manufacturing have the potential to help experimentalists to reduce costs and improve performances of LIBs. To do so, the electrode slurry phase, consisting of a suspension of active material, carbon additive and binder in a solvent must be modeled at first at the mesoscopic scale. However, efforts in that sense are rare in literature due to the inherent complexity of slurries and the difficulty of setting up appropriate metrics for the validation of the modeling results. For the first time, we propose an approach relying on experimental data that allows to validate the properties of simulated Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-based slurries with different compositions and solid contents through force fields (FFs) parametrization. The latter was attained by Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), which enables to model the slurry phase at the mesoscopic scale and to consider explicitly the carbon binder domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CGMD FFs parameterization can be accelerated thanks to different types of Particle Swarm Optimization-based algorithms, which would allow faster screening of different simulated slurries fabrication conditions.","Li-ion battery,NMC cathode,slurry phase,Particle Swarm Optimization,Machine Learning",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Electrochemistry,Materials Science",,7.093,"X-RAY,TOMOGRAPHY,FABRICATION,PROCESS,LITHIUM,SIMULATION,MICROSTRUCTURE,EVOLUTION,CALYPSO,COST",BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS,https://doi.org/10.1002/batt.202000049,

It has solved problems beyond the realm of traditional, hand-crafted machine learning algorithms and captured the imagination of practitioners who are inundated with all types of data. As public awareness of the efficacy of DL increases so does the desire to make use of it. But even for highly trained professionals it can be daunting to approach the rapidly increasing body of knowledge in the field. Where does one start? How does one determine if a particular DL model is applicable to their problem? How does one train and deploy them? With these questions in mind, we present an overview of some of the key DL architectures. We also discuss some new automatic architecture optimization protocols that use multi-agent approaches. Further, since guaranteeing system uptime is critical to many applications, a section dwells on using DL for fault detection and mitigation. This is followed by an exploratory survey of several areas where DL emerged as a game-changer: fraud detection in financial applications, financial time-series forecasting, predictive and prescriptive analytics, medical image processing, power systems research and recommender systems. The thrust of this review is to outline emerging applications of DL and provide a reference to researchers seeking to use DL in their work for pattern recognition with unparalleled learning capacity and the ability to scale with data.

However, there are over 50 known semiconducting half-Heusler phases, and it is not clear how the chemical composition affects the electronic structure. While all the n-type electronic structures have their conduction band minimum at either the Gamma- or X-point, there is more diversity in the p-type electronic structures, and the valence band maximum can be at either the Gamma-, L-, or W-point. Here, we use high throughput computation and machine learning to compare the valence bands of known half-Heusler compounds and discover new chemical guidelines for promoting the highly degenerate W-point to the valence band maximum. We do this by constructing an ""orbital phase diagram"" to cluster the variety of electronic structures expressed by these phases into groups, based on the atomic orbitals that contribute most to their valence bands. Then, with the aid of machine learning, we develop new chemical rules that predict the location of the valence band maximum in each of the phases.

We propose a supervised deep convolutional neural network to densely predict semantic segmentation and optical flow of the retina as mutually supportive tasks, implicitly inpainting retinal flow information missing due to occlusion by surgical tools. Methods As manual annotation of optical flow is infeasible, we propose a flexible algorithm for generation of large synthetic training datasets on the basis of given intra-operative retinal images. We evaluate optical flow estimation by tracking a grid and sparsely annotated ground truth points on a benchmark of challenging real intra-operative clips obtained from an extensive internally acquired dataset encompassing representative vitreoretinal surgical cases. Results The U-Net-based network trained on the synthetic dataset is shown to generalise well to the benchmark of real surgical videos. When used to track retinal points of interest, our flow estimation outperforms variational baseline methods on clips containing tool motions which occlude the points of interest, as is routinely observed in intra-operatively recorded surgery videos. Conclusions The results indicate that complex synthetic training datasets can be used to specifically guide optical flow estimation.

Reduction of positive margin rates when removing BCC leads to fewer revision surgeries and consequently lower health care costs, improved cosmetic outcomes and better patient care. In this study, we propose the first use of a perioperative mass spectrometry technology (iKnife) along with a deep learning framework for detection of BCC signatures from tissue burns. Methods Resected surgical specimen were collected and inspected by a pathologist. With their guidance, data were collected by burning regions of the specimen labeled as BCC or normal, with the iKnife. Data included 190 scans of which 127 were normal and 63 were BCC. A data augmentation approach was proposed by modifying the location and intensity of the peaks of the original spectra, through noise addition in the time and frequency domains. A symmetric autoencoder was built by simultaneously optimizing the spectral reconstruction error and the classification accuracy. Using t-SNE, the latent space was visualized. Results The autoencoder achieved an accuracy (standard deviation) of 96.62 (1.35%) when classifying BCC and normal scans, a statistically significant improvement over the baseline state-of-the-art approach used in the literature. The t-SNE plot of the latent space distinctly showed the separability between BCC and normal data, not visible with the original data. Augmented data resulted in significant improvements to the classification accuracy of the baseline model. Conclusion We demonstrate the utility of a deep learning framework applied to mass spectrometry data for surgical margin detection. We apply the proposed framework to an application with light surgical overhead and high incidence, the removal of BCC. The learnt models can accurately separate BCC from normal tissue.","Surgical margin detection,Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry,Intraoperative tissue characterization,Non-linear analysis,Autoencoder,Basal cell carcinoma",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"BREAST-CONSERVING,SURGERY",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

The multidimensional nature of the search necessitates exploration of multimillion compound libraries over which even density functional theory (DFT) screening is intractable. Machine learning (e.g., artificial neural network, ANN, or Gaussian process, GP) models for this task are limited by training data availability and predictive uncertainty quantification (UQ). We overcome such limitations by using efficient global optimization (EGO) with the multidimensional expected improvement (EI) criterion. EGO balances exploitation of a trained model with acquisition of new DFT data at the Pareto front, the region of chemical space that contains the optimal trade-off between multiple design criteria. We demonstrate this approach for the simultaneous optimization of redox potential and solubility in candidate M(II)/M(III) redox couples for redox flow batteries from a space of 2.8 M transition metal complexes designed for stability in practical redox flow battery (RFB) applications. We show that a multitask ANN with latent-distance-based UQ surpasses the generalization performance of a GP in this space. With this approach, ANN prediction and EI scoring of the full space are achieved in minutes. Starting from ca. 100 representative points, EGO improves both properties by over 3 standard deviations in only five generations. Analysis of lookahead errors confirms rapid ANN model improvement during the EGO process, achieving suitable accuracy for predictive design in the space of transition metal complexes. The ANN-driven EI approach achieves at least 500-fold acceleration over random search, identifying a Pareto-optimal design in around 5 weeks instead of 50 years.","ENERGY-STORAGE,DISCOVERY,BATTERY,CHEMISTRY,STRATEGIES,REDUCTION,MOLECULES,MODEL,VAN",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,15.435,"ENERGY-STORAGE,DISCOVERY,BATTERY,CHEMISTRY,STRATEGIES,REDUCTION,MOLECULES,MODEL,VAN",ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00026,

Estimates show that 13% of adults seek dental care for dental infection or fatigue within four years. The Social and individual burden of this disease can be reduced by its early detection. However, the symptoms of teeth infection in the early stages are not clear, hence, it would be relatively difficult to predict teeth infections based solely on human skills and experience. Big Data (BD) technologies have a great potential in transforming dental care, as they have revolutionized other industries. In addition to reducing cost, they could save millions of lives and improve patient outcomes. This paper proposes a novel integrated prediction model that extracts hidden knowledge from radiographic datasets containing a large volume of dental X-ray images and utilizes this knowledge to predict dental infections. Initially, preprocessing techniques using morphological skeleton and mean approach is applied to eliminate noise and enhance the images. Next, Multi Scale Segmented Region (MSR) approach, Watershed Approach (WA), Sobel edge Detection (SD), Histogram based Segmentation (HS), Trainable Segmentation (TS), Dual Clustering (DC), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) are examined for image segmentation and feature extraction. Among these methods, MSR was selected for feature extraction since it outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, precision, recall and F1-score. Then, a set of neural network classifiers are trained to identify patterns in the extracted optimized features and predict dental infections. For this purpose, we have examined Bacterial Optimized Recurrent Neural Networks (BORNN), Deep Learning Neural Networks (DANN), Genetic Optimized Neural Networks (GONN) and Adaptive Neural Networks Algorithm (ADNN). BORNN have shown maximum accuracy and Roc value (98.1% and 0.92 respectively), and minimum error values (MSE = 0.189, MAE = 0.143). The output of the proposed integrated prediction model is fed into a dental robot who proceeds with the treatment process with high accuracy and minimum delay.

Digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) datasets were generated using planning 4DCT data. Tumor positions were selected on respective DRR images to place the GTV center of gravity in the center of each DRR. DRR subimages around the tumor regions were cropped so that the subimage size was defined by tumor size. Training data were then classified into two groups: positive (including tumor) and negative (not including tumor) samples. Machine learning parameters were optimized by the extremely randomized tree method. For the tracking stage, a machine learning algorithm was generated to provide a tumor likelihood map using fluoroscopic images. Prior probability tumor positions were also calculated using the previous two frames. Tumor position was then estimated by calculating maximum probability on the tumor likelihood map and prior probability tumor positions.
We acquired treatment planning 4DCT images in eight patients. Digital fluoroscopic imaging systems on either side of the vertical irradiation port allowed fluoroscopic image acquisition during treatment delivery.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a hierarchical deep-learning method consisting of four stages: 1) a basic landmark annotator for 3D skull pose normalization, 2) a deep-learning-based coarse-to-fine landmark annotator on the midsagittal plane, 3) a low-dimensional representation of the total number of landmarks using variational autoencoder (VAE), and 4) a local-to-global landmark annotator. The implementation of the VAE allows two-dimensional-image-based 3D morphological feature learning and similarity/dissimilarity representation learning of the concatenated vectors of cephalometric landmarks. The proposed method achieves an average 3D point-to-point error of 3.63 mm for 93 cephalometric landmarks using a small number of training CT datasets. Notably, the VAE captures variations of craniofacial structural characteristics.","cephalometric landmark,computerized tomography,deep learning",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"ACTIVE,SHAPE,MODELS,IDENTIFICATION,CEPHALOGRAMS",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab7a71,

Related to the lack of derivative discontinuity in approximate exchange-correlation potentials, the information about the curvature has been successfully used to restore the physical meaning of Kohn-Sham orbital eigenvalues and to develop non-empirical tuning and correction schemes for density functional approximations. In this work, we propose the construction of a machine-learning framework targeting the average energy curvature between the neutral and the radical cation state of thousands of small organic molecules (QM7 database). The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the context of system-specific gamma-tuning of the LC-omega PBE functional and validated against the molecular first ionization potentials at equation-of-motion coupled-cluster references. In addition, we propose a local version of the non-linear regression model and demonstrate its transferability and predictive power by determining the optimal range-separation parameter for two large molecules relevant to the field of hole-transporting materials. Finally, we explore the underlying structure of the QM7 database with the t-SNE dimensionality-reduction algorithm and identify structural and compositional patterns that promote the deviation from the piecewise linearity condition.","NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION,FRONTIER ORBITAL ENERGIES,DENSITY FUNCTIONALS,DELOCALIZATION ERROR,SMALL MOLECULES,PARAMETERS,LANDSCAPES,DISCONTINUITIES,TRANSFERABILITY,PERFORMANCE",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,,"NONLINEAR,DIMENSIONALITY,REDUCTION,FRONTIER,ORBITAL,ENERGIES,DENSITY,FUNCTIONALS,DELOCALIZATION,ERROR,SMALL,MOLECULES,PARAMETERS,LANDSCAPES,DISCONTINUITIES,TRANSFERABILITY,PERFORMANCE",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0005039,

Purpose: To evaluate the performance of texture features extracted from heterogeneity subregions on subtraction MRI images for identifying human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 2+ status of breast cancers.
Materials and Methods: Seventy-six patients with HER2 2+ breast cancer who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were enrolled, including 42 HER2 positive and 34 negative cases confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The lesion area was delineated semi-automatically on the subtraction MRI images at the second, fourth, and sixth phases (P-1, P-2, and P-3). A regionalization method was used to segment the lesion area into three subregions (rapid, medium, and slow) according to peak arrival time of the contrast agent. We extracted 488 texture features from the whole lesion area and three subregions independently. Wrapper, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and stepwise methods were used to identify the optimal feature subsets. Univariate analysis was performed as well as support vector machine (SVM) with a leave-one-out-based cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of the classifiers.
Results: In univariate analysis, the variance from medium subregion at P-2 was the best-performing feature for distinguishing HER2 2+ status (AUC = 0.836); for the whole lesion region, the variance at P-2 achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.798). There was no significant difference between the two methods (P = 0.271). In the machine learning with SVM, the best performance (AUC = 0.929) was achieved with LASSO from rapid subregion at P-2; for the whole region, the highest AUC value was 0.847 obtained at P-2 with LASSO. The difference was significant between the two methods (P = 0.021).
Conclusion: The texture analysis of heterogeneity subregions based on intratumoral regionalization method showed potential value for recognizing HER2 2+ status in breast cancer.","breast cancer,receiver operating characteristic,immunohistochemistry,magnetic resonance imaging,gene expression",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Oncology,,6.264,"IN-SITU,HYBRIDIZATION,CONTRAST-ENHANCED,MRI,NEOADJUVANT,CHEMOTHERAPY,GENE,AMPLIFICATION,MOLECULAR,SUBTYPES,FEATURE-SELECTION,CANCER,HETEROGENEITY,EXPRESSION,FEATURES",FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7186477?pdf=render,

Images acquired on a 3-Tesla scanner (T2-weighted and post-contrast) from 32 patients (20 with low-grade and 12 with high-grade tumor) were annotated to generate volumes of interest enclosing CCRCC lesions. After image resampling, normalization, and filtering, 2438 features were extracted. A two-step feature reduction process was used to between 1 and 7 features depending on the algorithm employed. A J48 decision tree alone and in combination with ensemble learning methods were used. In the differentiation between high- and low-grade tumors, all the ensemble methods achieved an accuracy greater than 90%. On the other end, the best results in terms of accuracy (84.4%) in the assessment of tumor grade were achieved by the random forest.

In this research, the heat transfer, solar radiation transmission and indoor illuminance of an aerogel glazing system were characterized through an experimentally validated numerical model. Contribution ratios of multi-variables to multi-objectives were thereafter quantified, following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array. In respect to the application of aerogel glazing system in subtropical climates, an energy-related contradiction between indoor illuminance from solar and indoor heat gain, has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions. In order to minimise the total heat gain and maximise the indoor illuminance transmitted through the aerogel glazing system, a generic multi-objective optimisation methodology, with high computational efficiency and accuracy, has been developed, to identify the optimal design. The results indicate that through the Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation results, a significant reduction of total heat gain and an obvious increase of the indoor illuminance can be noticed. Compared to the optimal case in the standard orthogonal array, with the application of the proposed multi-objective optimisation methodology, the annual total heat gain could be reduced from 489305.5 to 333396.4 Wh by 31.9% and the annual indoor illuminance could be increased from 56786.6 to 172973.5 lux by 67.2%. The year-round performance indicates that, compared to the bi-objective optimisation (annual transmitted heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) with the annual total heat gain at 333.4 kWh/m(2) and annual indoor illuminance at 162.3 klux, the bi-objective optimisation (annual total heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) shows a lower annual total heat gain at 322.4 kWh/m(2) by 3.4%) and a higher annual indoor illuminance at 173 klux by 6.6%. This study proposes an overall framework and technical guidance of a new multi-objective optimisation methodology, which can automatically learn mechanisms of heat transfer and solar radiation transmittance through nanoporous aerogel granules, and identify the optimal multi-variables setting for the robust system design and operation.

There is a growing interest to continuously monitor these and other symptoms through body-worn sensor technology. However, limited battery life and memory capacity hinder the potential for continuous, long-term monitoring with these devices. There is little information available on the relative value of adding sensors, increasing sampling rate, or computing complex signal features, all of which may improve accuracy of symptom detection at the expense of computational resources. Here we build on a previous study to investigate the relationship between data measurement characteristics and accuracy when using wearable sensor data to classify tremor and bradykinesia in patients with PD. Methods Thirteen individuals with PD wore a flexible, skin-mounted sensor (collecting tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope data) and a commercial smart watch (collecting tri-axial accelerometer data) on their predominantly affected hand. The participants performed a series of standardized motor tasks, during which a clinician scored the severity of tremor and bradykinesia in that limb. Machine learning models were trained on scored data to classify tremor and bradykinesia. Model performance was compared when using different types of sensors (accelerometer and/or gyroscope), different data sampling rates (up to 62.5 Hz), and different categories of pre-engineered features (up to 148 features). Performance was also compared between the flexible sensor and smart watch for each analysis. Results First, there was no effect of device type for classifying tremor symptoms (p > 0.34), but bradykinesia models incorporating gyroscope data performed slightly better (up to 0.05 AUROC) than other models (p = 0.01). Second, model performance decreased with sampling frequency (p < 0.001) for tremor, but not bradykinesia (p > 0.47). Finally, model performance for both symptoms was maintained after substantially reducing the feature set. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the ability to simplify measurement characteristics from body-worn sensors while maintaining performance in PD symptom detection. Understanding the trade-off between model performance and data resolution is crucial to design efficient, accurate wearable sensing systems. This approach may improve the feasibility of long-term, continuous, and real-time monitoring of PD symptoms by reducing computational burden on wearable devices.","Parkinson's disease,Wearable sensors,Soft wearables,Machine learning,Symptom detection,Tremor,Bradykinesia,Daily activities",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology,Rehabilitation",,5.218,"HOME,DIARY,TREMOR,BRADYKINESIA,TELEMEDICINE,DYSKINESIA,ACCESS,CARE",JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168958,

Despite the advantages in ease of access and the lower cost, a gap in image quality can still be observed between the echocardiography (echo) data captured by point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) compared to conventional cart-based US, which limits the further adaptation of POCUS. In this work, we aim to present a machine learning solution based on recent advances in adversarial training to investigate the feasibility of translating POCUS echo images to the quality level of high-end cart-based US systems. Methods We propose a constrained cycle-consistent generative adversarial architecture for unpaired translation of cardiac POCUS to cart-based US data. We impose a structured shape-wise regularization via a critic segmentation network to preserve the underlying shape of the heart during quality translation. The proposed deep transfer model is constrained to the anatomy of the left ventricle (LV) in apical two-chamber (AP2) echo views. Results A total of 1089 echo studies from 841 patients are used in this study. The AP2 frames are captured by POCUS (Philips Lumify and Clarius) and cart-based (Philips iE33 and Vivid E9) US machines. The dataset of quality translation comprises a total of 441 echo studies from 395 patients. Data from both POCUS and cart-based systems of the same patient were available in 122 cases. The deep-quality transfer model is integrated into a pipeline for an automated cardiac evaluation task, namely segmentation of LV in AP2 view. By transferring the low-quality POCUS data to the cart-based US, a significant average improvement of 30% and 34 mm is obtained in the LV segmentation Dice score and Hausdorff distance metrics, respectively. Conclusion This paper presents the feasibility of a machine learning solution to transform the image quality of POCUS data to that of high-quality high-end cart-based systems.

For medical purposes, simple conceptual decision-making models that can learn are widely used. Decision trees are reliable and effective techniques which provide high classification accuracy. We tested if we could detect appendicitis and differentiate uncomplicated from complicated cases using machine learning algorithms. Materials and methods We analyzed all cases admitted between 2010 and 2016 that fell into the following categories: healthy controls (Group 1); sham controls (Group 2); sham disease (Group 3), and acute abdomen (Group 4). The latter group was further divided into four groups: false laparotomy; uncomplicated appendicitis; complicated appendicitis without abscess, and complicated appendicitis with abscess. Patients with comorbidities and whose complete blood count and/or pathology results were lacking were excluded. Data were collected for demographics, preoperative blood analysis, and postoperative diagnosis. Various machine learning algorithms were applied to detect appendicitis patients. Results There were 7244 patients with a mean age of 6.84 +/- 5.31 years, of whom 82.3% (5960/7244) were male. Most algorithms tested, especially linear methods, provided similar performance measures. We preferred the decision tree model due to its easier interpretability. With this algorithm, we detected appendicitis patients with 93.97% area under the curve (AUC), 94.69% accuracy, 93.55% sensitivity, and 96.55% specificity, and uncomplicated appendicitis with 79.47% AUC, 70.83% accuracy, 66.81% sensitivity, and 81.88% specificity.

While it is of high interest for the transportation industry to design and discover different grades of DP steels exhibiting desirable mechanical properties, this requires exploring a large number of DP steel microstructure combinations. Expensive trial-and-error-based experimentations and multiscale materials simulations are two conventional approaches that have been widely adopted in the field of materials design and discovery. Yet, it is challenging to use such approaches for fast materials design and discovery when considering the computational and cost limitations, as it is computationally infeasible and intractable to use multiscale materials models to characterize the mechanical properties of millions of different microstructures. To address this major limitation in material design, a Gaussian process is developed to accelerate the discovery of the mechanical properties of different DP steels by evolving the microstructure parameters using a limited number of numerical simulations (using a multiscale materials model). A Gaussian process is a machine learning technique that is trained to find nontrivial correlations between a set of inputs (microstructure properties) to predict a desired output (mechanical property). The proposed Gaussian process not only accelerates the prediction of the desired mechanical properties of millions of multiscale materials simulations but also offers uncertainty quantification around its predictions. These merits make the Gaussian process a very reliable, robust, and practical solution for material design exploration. The proposed framework combining multiscale simulations and the Gaussian process is used to discover the microstructural design of DP steel with maximum tensile toughness. The results showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in comparison to benchmark methods.","DUAL-PHASE STEELS,REPRESENTATIVE VOLUME ELEMENT,GAUSSIAN PROCESS,DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR,MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR,MARTENSITE,MICROSTRUCTURE,STRENGTH,STRESS,FAILURE",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,2.602,"DUAL-PHASE,STEELS,REPRESENTATIVE,VOLUME,ELEMENT,GAUSSIAN,PROCESS,DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR,MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR,MARTENSITE,MICROSTRUCTURE,STRENGTH,STRESS,FAILURE",METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,,

Interpreting brain images is considered as a time-consuming task with a high error-prone. Recently, advanced machine learning methods have successfully proved high performance in various fields including brain image analysis. These existing techniques, which become more used for clinical disease detection, present challenging wrongness sensibility to detect aberrant values or areas in the human brain.

Because of the sensitivity to field (B-0) inhomogeneity, the total acquisition time is prolonged due to the repeated image acquisitions at several saturation offset frequencies, which can cause practical issues such as increased sensitivity to patient motions. Because GluCEST signal is derived from the small z-spectrum difference, it often has a low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). We proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based algorithm armed with wide activation neural network blocks to address both issues.
Methods: B-0 correction based on reduced saturation offset acquisitions was performed for the positive and negative sides of the z-spectrum separately. For each side, a separate deep residual network was trained to learn the nonlinear mapping from few CEST-weighted images acquired at different ppm values to the one at 3 ppm (where GluCEST peaks) in the same side of the z-spectrum.
Results: All DL-based methods outperformed the ""traditional"" method visually and quantitatively. The wide activation blocks-based method showed the highest performance in terms of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which were 0.84 and 25dB respectively. SNR increases in regions of interest were over 8dB.

Affective disorders are a major global burden, with approximately 15% of people worldwide suffering from some form of affective disorder. In patients experiencing their first depressive episode, in most cases it cannot be distinguished whether this is due to bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Valid fluid biomarkers able to discriminate between the two disorders in a clinical setting are not yet available.
Material and Methods
Seventy depressed patients suffering from BD (bipolar I and II subtypes) and 42 patients with major MDD were recruited and blood samples were taken for proteomic analyses after 8 h fasting. Proteomic profiles were analyzed using the Multiplex Immunoassay platform from Myriad Rules Based Medicine (Myriad RBM; Austin, Texas, USA). Human DiscoveryMAP(TM) was used to measure the concentration of various proteins, peptides, and small molecules. A multivariate predictive model was consequently constructed to differentiate between BD and MDD.
Results
Based on the various proteomic profiles, the algorithm could discriminate depressed BD patients from MDD patients with an accuracy of 67%.
Discussion
The results of this preliminary study suggest that future discrimination between bipolar and unipolar depression in a single case could be possible, using predictive biomarker models based on blood proteomic profiling.","affective disorder,bipolar disorder,major depression (MD),major depressive disorder (MDD),proteome,biomarker,blood,machine learning",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Psychiatry,,4.409,"GENE-EXPRESSION,DISORDER,ATTENTION,THROMBOSPONDIN-1,ASSOCIATION,GUIDELINES,CYTOKINES,RESPONSES,PLASMA",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7184109?pdf=render,

Therefore, computer-assisted brain tumor classification techniques have been proposed. These techniques have several drawbacks or limitations. Capsule based neural networks are new approaches that can preserve spatial relationships of learned features using dynamic routing algorithm. By this way, not only performance of tumor recognition increases but also sampling efficiency and generalisation capability improves. Therefore, in this work, a Capsule Network (CapsNet) is used to achieve fully automated classification of tumors from brain magnetic resonance images. In this work, prevalent three types of tumors (pituitary, glioma and meningioma) have been handled. The main contributions in this paper are as follows: 1) A comprehensive review on CapsNet based methods is presented. 2) A new CapsNet topology is designed by using a Sobolev gradient-based optimisation, expectation-maximisation based dynamic routing and tumor boundary information. 3) The network topology is applied to categorise three types of brain tumors. 4) Comparative evaluations of the results obtained by other methods are performed. According to the experimental results, the proposed CapsNet based technique can achieve extraction of desired features from image data sets and provides tumor classification automatically with 92.65% accuracy.","medical image processing,image classification,neural nets,feature extraction,brain,biomedical MRI,gradient methods,learning (artificial intelligence),expectation-maximisation algorithm,tumours,optimisation,CapsNet topology,brain images,brain tissues,meningioma,ependymoma,computer-assisted brain tumour classification techniques,Capsule-based neural networks,tumour recognition,brain magnetic resonance images,glioma,CapsNet based methods,expectation-maximisation based dynamic routing,tumour boundary information,pituitary,Sobolev gradient-based optimisation,network topology,feature extraction,learned features",Article,"INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET, MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,2.481,"QUALITY-OF-LIFE,PITUITARY-TUMORS,CLASSIFICATION,SEGMENTATION,TEXTURE,SURGERY,GLIOMAS",IET IMAGE PROCESSING,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1049/iet-ipr.2019.0312,

In the field, the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of CPB is critical as it is closely related to the stability of stopes. Predicting the UCS of CPB using traditional mathematical models is far from being satisfactory due to the highly nonlinear relationships between the UCS and a large number of influencing variables. To solve this problem, this study uses a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the UCS of CPB. The hyperparameters of the SVM model are tuned using the beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm; then, the model is called BSVM. The BSVM is then trained on a dataset collected from the experimental results. To explain the importance of each input variable on the UCS of CPB, the variable importance is obtained using a sensitivity study with the BSVM as the objective function. The results show that the proposed BSVM has high prediction accuracy on the test set with a high correlation coefficient (0.97) and low root-mean-square error (0.27 MPa). The proposed model can guide the design of CPB during mining.","UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH,NEURAL-NETWORK,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,PHOSPHOGYPSUM,PREDICTION,TAILINGS,WASTE",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,1.923,"UNCONFINED,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,NEURAL-NETWORK,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,PHOSPHOGYPSUM,PREDICTION,TAILINGS,WASTE",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2020/1643529.pdf,

Therefore, each BCI user has to attend a certain number of calibration sessions to be able to use the system. However, such calibration requirements may be difficult to fulfill especially for patients with disabilities. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic transfer learning approach to reduce the calibration requirements of our EEG-fTCD hybrid BCI designed using motor imagery (MI) and flickering mental rotation (MR)/word generation (WG) paradigms. The proposed approach identifies the top similar datasets from previous BCI users to a small training dataset collected from a current BCI user and uses these datasets to augment the training data of the current BCI user. To achieve such an aim, EEG and fTCD feature vectors of each trial were projected into scalar scores using support vector machines. EEG and fTCD class conditional distributions were learnt separately using the scores of each class. Bhattacharyya distance was used to identify similarities between class conditional distributions obtained using training trials of the current BCI user and those obtained using trials of previous users. Results Experimental results showed that the performance obtained using the proposed transfer learning approach outperforms the performance obtained without transfer learning for both MI and flickering MR/WG paradigms. In particular, it was found that the calibration requirements can be reduced by at least 60.43% for the MI paradigm, while at most a reduction of 17.31% can be achieved for the MR/WG paradigm. Conclusions Data collected using the MI paradigm show better generalization across subjects.","Hybrid brain-computer interfaces,Transfer learning,Common spatial pattern,Template matching,Wavelet decomposition,Probabilistic fusion",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,2.905,"TRANSCRANIAL,DOPPLER,ULTRASOUND",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164278,

In addition, multi-omics data increase the chance to robustly identify molecular patient sub-groups and hence open the door towards a better personalized treatment of diseases. Several methods have been proposed for unsupervised clustering of multi-omics data. However, a number of challenges remain, such as the magnitude of features and the large difference in dimensionality across different omics data sources. Results We propose a multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder framework coupled with sparse non-negative matrix factorization to robustly cluster patients based on multi-omics data. The proposed model specifically leverages pathway information to effectively reduce the dimensionality of omics data into a pathway and patient specific score profile. In consequence, our method allows us to understand, which pathway is a feature of which particular patient cluster. Moreover, recently proposed machine learning techniques allow us to disentangle the specific impact of each individual omics feature on a pathway score. We applied our method to cluster patients in several cancer datasets using gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and CNVs, demonstrating the possibility to obtain biologically plausible disease subtypes characterized by specific molecular features. Comparison against several competing methods showed a competitive clustering performance. In addition, post-hoc analysis of somatic mutations and clinical data provided supporting evidence and interpretation of the identified clusters. Conclusions Our suggested multi-modal sparse denoising autoencoder approach allows for an effective and interpretable integration of multi-omics data on pathway level while addressing the high dimensional character of omics data.

Delayed diagnosis is frequent due to lack of knowledge of most clinicians and a small number of expert centers. Consequently, computerized diagnosis support systems have been developed to address these issues, with many relying on rare disease expertise and taking advantage of the increasing volume of generated and accessible health-related data. Our objective is to perform a review of all initiatives aiming to support the diagnosis of rare diseases. Methods A scoping review was conducted based on methods proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. A charting form for relevant study analysis was developed and used to categorize data. Results Sixty-eight studies were retained at the end of the charting process. Diagnosis targets varied from 1 rare disease to all rare diseases. Material used for diagnosis support consisted mostly of phenotype concepts, images or fluids. Fifty-seven percent of the studies used expert knowledge. Two-thirds of the studies relied on machine learning algorithms, and one-third used simple similarities. Manual algorithms were encountered as well. Most of the studies presented satisfying performance of evaluation by comparison with references or with external validation. Fourteen studies provided online tools, most of which aimed to support the diagnosis of all rare diseases by considering queries based on phenotype concepts. Conclusion Numerous solutions relying on different materials and use of various methodologies are emerging with satisfying preliminary results.

Candidate electrolyte materials must satisfy several requirements-chief among them fast ionic conductivity and robust electrochemical stability. Considering these two requirements, we find new evidence to suggest that Cl-, Br-, and I-based solid ion conductors are generally more likely to satisfy fast ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability requirements than materials from other common families, e.g., the sulfides and oxides. Furthermore, we find that sulfide- and oxide-based materials are generally poor electrolyte candidates, but optimization of the sulfides for fast ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability may be more likely than optimization of the oxides. We also find that the nitrides and phosphides appear to be the most promising material families for electrolytes stable against Li-metal anodes. Furthermore, the spread of the existing data in performance space suggests that fast conducting materials that are stable against both Li metal and a >4 V cathode are exceedingly rare and that a multiple-electrolyte architecture is a more likely path to successfully realizing a solid-state Li metal battery by approximately an order of magnitude or more. Our model is validated by its reproduction of well-known trends that have emerged from the limited existing data in recent years, namely that the electronegativity of the lattice anion correlates with ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this work, we leverage the existing data to provide the first data-driven quantification of trends and correlations among ionic conductivity, stability, and anion electronegativity, building a roadmap to complement material discovery efforts around the desired material performance.","DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,SUPERIONIC CONDUCTOR,LITHIUM,PRINCIPLES,STABILITY,ENERGY,ELECTRONEGATIVITY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL,THEORY,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE,SUPERIONIC,CONDUCTOR,LITHIUM,PRINCIPLES,STABILITY,ENERGY,ELECTRONEGATIVITY",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08996,

A major obstacle to determining such a relationship is the lack of a robust and physically intuitive structure descriptor capable of distinguishing between disparate GB structures. We demonstrate that a microscopic structure metric, the local distortion factor, correlates well with atomically decomposed thermal conductivities obtained from perturbed molecular dynamics for a wide variety of MgO GBs. Based on this correlation, a model for accurately predicting thermal conductivity of GBs is constructed using machine learning techniques. The model reveals that small distortions to local atomic environments are sufficient to reduce overall thermal conductivity dramatically.

Our FeFET operates with low writing energy (fJ) and fast programming time (40 ns). Retention measurements have been performed over 4 bit depth with low noise (1%) in the tungsten oxide (WOx) readout channel. By adjusting the channel thickness from 15 to 8 nm, the on/off ratio of the FeFET can be engineered from 1 to 200% with an on-resistance ideally >100 k Omega, depending on the channel geometry. The device concept is using earth-abundant materials and is compatible with a back end of line (BEOL) integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes. It has therefore a great potential for the fabrication of high-density, large-scale integrated arrays of artificial analog synapses.","ferroelectric switching,hafnium zirconium oxide,tungsten oxide,BEOL,ferroelectric field-effect transistor,memristor",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"MEMORY,FILMS,RETENTION,OPERATION,FET",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06475,

We implemented a compact and easy to visualize algorithm and interface in Python. This software uses time series as input. We applied the maxclique graph operator in order to obtain further graph parameters. We extracted features of the time series by processing all graph parameters through K-means, one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithms. As proof of principle, we analyzed integrated electrical activity of XII nerve to identify waveforms. Our results show that the use of maxcliques allows identification of two distinct types of waveforms that match expert classification. We propose that our method can be a useful tool to characterize and classify other electrophysiological signals in a short time and objectively. Reducing the classification time improves efficiency for further analysis in order to compare between treatments or conditions, e.g., pharmacological trials, injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases.","visibility graphs,graph theory,maxcliques,electrophysiological signals,deep learning,pre-Botzinger complex,XII nerve,sigh",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"MULTIFUNCTIONAL,NETWORK,SYNAPTIC,MECHANISMS,GENERATION,MODULATION,EUPNEA,SIGHS",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174547,

Monitoring this load can provide valuable information to clinicians. For example, a patient's joint loading measured across different activities can be used to determine the amount of exercise that the patient needs to complete each day. Unfortunately, current methods for measuring joint loading require a lab environment which most clinicians do not have access to. This study explores employing machine learning to construct a model that can estimate joint loading based on sensor data obtained solely from a mobile phone. In order to learn such a model, we collected a dataset from 10 patients with hip osteoarthritis who performed multiple repetitions of nine different exercises. During each repetition, we simultaneously recorded 3D motion capture data, ground reaction force data, and the inertial measurement unit data from a mobile phone attached to the patient's hip. The 3D motion and ground reaction force data were used to compute the ground truth joint loading using musculoskeletal modeling. Our goal is to estimate the ground truth loading value using only the data captured by the sensors of the mobile phone. We propose a machine learning pipeline for learning such a model based on the recordings of a phone's accelerometer and gyroscope. When evaluated for an unseen patient, the proposed pipeline achieves a mean absolute error of 29% for the left hip and 36% for the right hip. While our approach is a step in the direction of using a minimal number of sensors to estimate joint loading outside the lab, developing a tool that is accurate enough to be applicable in a clinical context still remains an open challenge. It may be necessary to use sensors at more than one location in order to obtain better estimates.","machine learning,inertial measurement units,joint loading,patient monitoring,hip osteoarthrithis",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"OSTEOARTHRITIS,ACCELEROMETRY,KINEMATICS",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7174587?pdf=render,

Though a large number of HEMs have emerged, there is still in lack of theoretical predictions and simulations on HEMs, which is probably caused by the chemical complexity of HEMs. In this work, we demonstrate that the machine learning potentials developed in recent years can overcome the complexity of HEMs, and serve as powerful theoretical tools to simulate HEMs. A deep learning potential (DLP) for high entropy (Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C is fitted with the prediction error in energy and force being 9.4 meV/atom and 217 meV/A, respectively. The reliability and generality of the DLP are affirmed, since it can accurately predict lattice parameters and elastic constants of mono-phase carbides TMC (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta). Lattice constants (increase from 4.5707 A to 4.6727 A), thermal expansion coefficients (increase from 7.85x10(-6) K-1 to 10.58 x 10(-6) K-1), phonon thermal conductivities (decrease from 2.02 W m(-1) K-1 to 0.95 W m(-1) K-1), and elastic properties of high entropy (Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C in temperature ranging from 0 degrees C to 2400 degrees C are predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. The predicted room temperature properties agree well with experimental measurements, indicating the high accuracy of the DLP. With introducing of machine learning potentials, many problems that are intractable by traditional methods can be handled now. It is hopeful that deep insight into HEMs can be obtained in the future by such powerful methods.

Modeling approaches can have major impacts on prediction accuracy. However, the impact of selecting best parameters for an algorithm (tuning), to optimize non-linear models for predicting soil properties, is relatively unexplored in the domain of soil sciences. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of linear (partial least squares, PLS) and non-linear (support vector machines, SVM) multivariate regression models in estimating soil physical, chemical, and biological properties with mid-DRIFTS. We evaluated the impact of optimizing two hyperparameters (epsilon and cost) based on the noise tolerance in the epsilon-insensitive loss function of SVM models using two contrasting and diverse sets of soils, one from northern Tanzania (n = 533) and another one from USA Midwest (n = 400). Regression models were trained on calibration sets (75%) and tested on independent validation sets (25%) separately for each dataset. Support vector machines outperformed PIS models for all tested soil properties (clay, sand, pH, total organic carbon, and permanganate oxidizable carbon) in both datasets. Tuning hyperparameters epsilon and cost maintained or improved prediction accuracy of SVM models based on root mean squared errors of independent validation sets. Support vector machines tuned hyperparameters differed among soil properties and also for the same soil property in distinct datasets, suggesting the need for parameterizing non-linear models for specific soil properties and datasets. Optimizing SVM regression models in mid-DRIFTS improves prediction accuracy of soil properties and therefore will likely enable obtaining more robust predictive outcomes even in datasets with diverse land uses, parent materials, and/or soil orders. We recommend that tuning should be included as a routine step when using SVM for estimating soil properties.","Machine-learning,Kernel,Error-grid,FTIR,RMSE",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE,SPECTROSCOPY,ORGANIC-CARBON,INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY,USAMBARA,MOUNTAINS,CALIBRATION,MATTER",GEODERMA,,

However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30% overall samples) at three depths, 010 cm, 1030 cm, 3050 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lins concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 010 cm and 1030 cm depths, whereas for the 3050 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m-1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m-1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m-1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.","Soil salinization,Predictive mapping,Environmental covariates,Algorithms,Random forest",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"STOCHASTIC,GRADIENT,TREEBOOST,MACHINE-LEARNING,TECHNIQUES,MODIS,TIME-SERIES,LAND-USE,SPATIAL,PREDICTION,SOUTHERN,XINJIANG,NEURAL-NETWORKS,RIVER-BASIN,REGRESSION,SALINIZATION",GEODERMA,,

Microaneurysms appear as the earliest symptom of DR. Accurate and reliable detection of microaneurysms in color fundus images has great importance for DR screening. Methods A microaneurysms' detection method using machine learning based on directional local contrast (DLC) is proposed for the early diagnosis of DR. First, blood vessels were enhanced and segmented using improved enhancement function based on analyzing eigenvalues of Hessian matrix. Next, with blood vessels excluded, microaneurysm candidate regions were obtained using shape characteristics and connected components analysis. After image segmented to patches, the features of each microaneurysm candidate patch were extracted, and each candidate patch was classified into microaneurysm or non-microaneurysm. The main contributions of our study are (1) making use of directional local contrast in microaneurysms' detection for the first time, which does make sense for better microaneurysms' classification. (2) Applying three different machine learning techniques for classification and comparing their performance for microaneurysms' detection. The proposed algorithm was trained and tested on e-ophtha MA database, and further tested on another independent DIARETDB1 database. Results of microaneurysms' detection on the two databases were evaluated on lesion level and compared with existing algorithms. Results The proposed method has achieved better performance compared with existing algorithms on accuracy and computation time. On e-ophtha MA and DIARETDB1 databases, the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.87 and 0.86, respectively. The free-response ROC (FROC) score on the two databases was 0.374 and 0.210, respectively. The computation time per image with resolution of 2544x1969, 1400x960 and 1500x1152 is 29 s, 3 s and 2.6 s, respectively.

ML has proven to be a significant tool for the development of computer aided technology. Furthermore, secondary research has been widely conducted over the years for ophthalmologists. Such aspects indicate the importance of ML in the context of retinal image processing. Methods The publications that were chosen to compose this review were gathered from Scopus, PubMed, IEEEXplore and Science Direct databases. Then, the papers published between 2014 and 2019 were selected . Researches that used the segmented optic disc method were excluded. Moreover, only the methods which applied the classification process were considered. The systematic analysis was performed in such studies and, thereupon, the results were summarized. Discussion Based on architectures used for ML in retinal image processing, some studies applied feature extraction and dimensionality reduction to detect and isolate important parts of the analyzed image. Differently, other works utilized a deep convolutional network. Based on the evaluated researches, the main difference between the architectures is the number of images demanded for processing and the high computational cost required to use deep learning techniques. Conclusions All the analyzed publications indicated it was possible to develop an automated system for glaucoma diagnosis. The disease severity and its high occurrence rates justify the researches which have been carried out.

The laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) is an effective way to treat renal cancer. Localization and delineation of the renal tumor from pre-operative CT Angiography (CTA) is an important step for LPN surgery planning. Recently, with the development of the technique of deep learning, deep neural networks can be trained to provide accurate pixel-wise renal tumor segmentation in CTA images. However, constructing the training dataset with a large amount of pixel-wise annotations is a time-consuming task for the radiologists. Therefore, weakly-supervised approaches attract more interest in research. Methods In this paper, we proposed a novel weakly-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) for renal tumor segmentation. A three-stage framework was introduced to train the CNN with the weak annotations of renal tumors, i.e. the bounding boxes of renal tumors. The framework includes pseudo masks generation, group and weighted training phases. Clinical abdominal CT angiographic images of 200 patients were applied to perform the evaluation. Results Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.826 than the other two existing weakly-supervised deep neural networks. Furthermore, the segmentation performance is close to the fully supervised deep CNN.

We propose algorithms to better detect some critical points of the PPG signal, such as systolic and diastolic peaks, dicrotic notch and inflection point. These algorithms are applicable to different PPG signal morphologies and improve the precision of feature extraction. We show that the logarithm of dicrotic notch reflection index, the ratio of low- to high-frequency components of heart rate (HR) variability signal, and the product of HR multiplied by the modified Normalized Pulse Volume (mNPV) are the key features in accurately estimating the BP using PPG signal.

Research suggests that insufficient sleep results in low energy levels, various negative physiological and psychological effects on the body, and abnormal cognitive functioning. Studies have predominantly focused on driving while drowsy, using brainwave measurement and facial detection techniques to address this topic, whereas few have discussed the physiological prediction of drowsiness. In addition to driving, working conditions and environments as well as daily activities also correspond to the risk of accidents occurring when people are drowsy. This study designed an experiment consisting of five tests in which a brainwave sensor, eye tracker, heart rate sensor, and galvanic skin response sensor were used to record physiological changes in participants. The data indicated the binary outcomes of patients either being or not being in a state of drowsiness or sleepiness. During various states of drowsiness or sleepiness, brain wave activity, eye movement, heart rate, and GSR were measured, and differences in these physiological responses were analyzed. A classification model was also used to predict a participant's state of drowsiness or sleepiness. Data on physiological characteristics included eye movement and the heart rate value, which was calculated during various states of drowsiness or sleepiness to obtain a value.

Subsequently, the data were processed through an artificial neural network (ANN), back propagation network, and support vector machine (SVM). In the experiment, the SVM hyperparameters were adjusted, the ANN model was added to the Adam optimization model, and overfitting was avoided to ensure that the results were comprehensive. According to the experiment results, the use of SVM yields the optimal classification performance, reaching an accuracy of 89.1%; 90% of participants were also categorized more accurately through SVM than ANN.","Drowsiness,eye tracking,brainwave,heart rate,galvanic skin response (GSR),machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"SHIFT,WORK,SLEEP,ATTENTION,INSOMNIA",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,,

It is well known that microstructure determines properties, but expressing these structural features in a universal quantitative fashion has proved to be extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on training supervised learning algorithms to place microstructure images into predefined classes, but this approach assumes a level of a priori knowledge that may not always be available. In this paper, we expand this idea to the semi-supervised context in which class labels are known with confidence for only a fraction of the microstructures that represent the material system. It is shown that classifiers which perform well on both the high-confidence labeled data and the unlabeled, ambiguous data can be constructed by relying on the labeling consensus of a collection of semi-supervised learning methods. We also demonstrate the use of novel error estimation approaches for unlabeled data to establish robust confidence bounds on the classification performance over the entire microstructure space.

Quantitative description and analysis of these cellular structures in 3D are needed in order to understand their mechanical properties and underlying design strategies. In this paper series, we present a framework for analyzing such structures based on high-resolution 3D tomography data and utilize this framework to investigate the structural designs of stereom by using the spines from the sea urchin Heterocentrotus mamillatus as a model system. The first paper here reports the proposed cellular network analysis framework, which consists of five major steps: synchrotron-based tomography and hierarchical convolutional neural network-based reconstruction, machine learning-based segmentation, cellular network registration, feature extraction, and data representation and analysis. This framework enables the characterization of the porous stereom structures at the individual node and branch level (similar to 10 hm), the local cellular level (similar to 100 hm), and the global network level (similar to 1 mm). We define and quantify multiple structural descriptors at each level, such as node connectivity, branch length and orientation, branch profile, ring structure, etc., which allows us to investigate the cellular network construction of H. mamillatus spines quantitatively. The methodology reported here could be tailored to analyze other natural or engineering open-cell porous materials for a comprehensive multiscale network representation and mechanical analysis.
Statement of Significance
The mechanical robustness of the biomineralized porous structures in sea urchin spines has long been recognized. However, quantitative cellular network representation and analysis of this class of natural cellular solids are still limited in the literature. This constrains our capability to fully understand the mechanical properties and design strategies in sea urchin spines and other similar echinoderms' porous skeletal structures. Combining high-resolution tomography and computer vision-based analysis, this work presents a multiscale 3D network analysis framework, which allows for extraction, registration, and quantification of sea urchin spines' complex porous structure from the individual branch and node level to the global network level. This 3D structural analysis is relevant to a diversity of research fields, such as biomineralization, skeletal biology, biomimetics, material science, etc. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.","Echinoderms,Sea urchin spines,X-ray computed tomography,3D network topology,Cellular solids,Porous structure",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,9.0,"LIGHTWEIGHT,CERAMICS,MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR,MODEL-SYSTEM,INSIGHTS,SKELETON,PHASE,LIGHT,FOAMS,IMAGE,BONE",ACTA BIOMATERIALIA,,

However, with an ever-increasing demand for glasses in a variety of healthcare applications - especially with controlled degradation rates - it is becoming difficult to design new glass compositions using conventional approaches. For example, it is difficult, if not impossible, to design new gene-activation bioactive glasses, with controlled release of functional ions tailored for specific patient states, using trial-and-error based approaches. Notwithstanding, it is possible to design new glasses with controlled release of functional ions by using artificial intelligence-based methods, for example, supervised machine learning (ML). In this paper, we present an ensemble ML model for reliable prediction of time-and composition-dependent dissolution behavior of a wide variety of oxide glasses relevant for various biomedical applications. A comprehensive database, comprising of over 1300 data-records consolidated from original glass dissolution experiments, has been used for training and subsequent testing of prediction performance of the ML model. Results demonstrate that the ensemble ML model can predict chemical degradation behavior of glasses in aqueous solutions over a wide range of pH relevant for their usage in a human body where the environment can be highly acidic (for example, pH = 3), for example, due to secretion of citric acid by osteoclasts, or highly alkaline (pH approximate to 10) due to the release of alkali cations from bioactive glasses. Outcomes of this study can be leveraged to design glasses with controlled dissolution behavior in various biological environments.
