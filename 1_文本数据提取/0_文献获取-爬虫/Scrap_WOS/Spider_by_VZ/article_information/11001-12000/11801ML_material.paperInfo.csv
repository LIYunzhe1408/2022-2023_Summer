1,Selective encryption on ECG data in body sensor network based on supervised machine learning,55,,59-67,"Qiu Han,Qiu Meikang,Lu Zhihui","Qiu H,Qiu MK,Lu ZH",Lu ZH,10.1016/j.inffus.2019.07.012,Fudan University,"Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are developing rapidly in recent years as it combines the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and data analytic techniques for building a remote healthcare system. However, as BSNs are implemented on the existing wireless communication systems, the security and privacy in the BSN are facing many challenges. Performing standard encryption schemes on the health data before outsourcing at the sensors' ends are not suitable for this BSN environment as it is costly both in energy and time consumption for the BSN sensors. Traditional lightweight encryption schemes such as Selective Encryption (SE) schemes could be used in this environment by reducing the data volume to be encrypted. In this paper, we re-define the SE schemes in a practical scenario of securely outsourcing the electrocardiogram (ECG) data in the untrusted BSN environment. Specifically, if the ECG data is outsourced for disease classification based on a machine learning model, we prove that the classic SE schemes are not the correct designs. Then, we give our SE design based on this classification use case to protect the ECG data against illegal classification at the attacker sides which further protects the patients' data privacy. Intensive tests are experimented to prove the effectiveness of our proposed SE method.","Selective encryption,ECG fusion,Privacy,Machine learning,SVM",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,"MULTISENSOR,DATA,FUSION,COMPONENTS,DEPLOYMENT,RESOURCE",INFORMATION FUSION,,

Strong distortions are introduced on reconstructions obtained by the Wolf transform inversion method due to the ill-posed measurements acquired from the limited numerical apertures (NAs) of the optical system. Despite the recent success of DNNs in solving ill-posed inverse problems, the application to 3-D optical imaging is particularly challenging due to the lack of the ground truth. We overcome this limitation by generating digital phantoms that serve as samples for the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) to generate multiple 2-D projection maps for a limited range of illumination angles. The presented samples are red blood cells (RBCs), which are highly affected by the ill-posed problems due to their morphology. The trained network using synthetic measurements from the digital phantoms successfully eliminates the introduced distortions. Most importantly, we obtain high fidelity reconstructions from experimentally recorded projections of real RBC sample using the network that was trained on digitally generated RBC phantoms. Finally, we confirm the reconstruction accuracy using the DDA to calculate the 2-D projections of the 3-D reconstructions and compare them to the experimentally recorded projections.","optical diffraction tomography,three-dimensional imaging,machine learning,deep learning,image reconstruction,red blood cell,missing cone problem",Article,"SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98225 USA",Optics,,,PRINCIPLES,ADVANCED PHOTONICS,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/286015/files/1.AP.2.2.026001.pdf,

The deep neural network model is based on translating protein sequences and structural information into a musical score that features different pitches for each of the amino acids, and variations in note length and note volume reflecting secondary structure information and information about the chain length and distinct protein molecules. We train a deep learning model whose architecture is composed of several long short-term memory units from data consisting of musical representations of proteins classified by certain features, focused here on alpha-helix rich proteins. Using the deep learning model, we then generate de novo musical scores and translate the pitch information and chain lengths into sequences of amino acids. We use a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool to compare the predicted amino acid sequences against known proteins, and estimate folded protein structures using the Optimized protein fold RecognitION method (ORION) and MODELLER. We find that the method proposed here can be used to design de novo proteins that do not exist yet, and that the designed proteins fold into specified secondary structures. We validate the newly predicted protein by molecular dynamics equilibration in explicit water and subsequent characterization using a normal mode analysis.

ML techniques are used for the analysis of clinical parameters and their combinations for prognosis, therapy planning and support and patient management and wellbeing. In this research, we investigate a crucial problem associated with medical applications such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) data imbalances in which cases are far more than just controls in the dataset. In autism diagnosis data, the number of possible instances is linked with one class, i.e. the no ASD is larger than the ASD, and this may cause performance issues such as models favouring the majority class and undermining the minority class. This research experimentally measures the impact of class imbalance issue on the performance of different classifiers on real autism datasets when various data imbalance approaches are utilised in the pre-processing phase. We employ oversampling techniques, such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE), and undersampling with different classifiers including Naive Bayes, RIPPER, C4.5 and Random Forest to measure the impact of these on the performance of the models derived in terms of area under curve and other metrics. Results pinpoint that oversampling techniques are superior to undersampling techniques, at least for the toddlers' autism dataset that we consider, and suggest that further work should look at incorporating sampling techniques with feature selection to generate models that do not overfit the dataset.","Autism spectrum disorder,ASD screening,data imbalance,machine learning,undersampling,oversampling,SMOTE",Article,"WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD, 5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",Information Science & Library Science,,,"QUANTITATIVE,CHECKLIST",JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,https://pure.hud.ac.uk/ws/files/20026596/JIKM_2020_March_Issue_Paper_No_2_KDD_group_1_.pdf,
5,Early immune stimulation and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Costa Rica: A comparison of statistical approaches,182,,,"Colombari Figueroa Sophia,Kennedy Chris J.,Wesseling Catharina,Wiemels Joseph M.,Morimoto Libby,Mora Ana M.","Figueroa SC,Kennedy CJ,Wesseling C,Wiemels JM,Morimoto L,Mora AM",Mora AM,10.1016/j.envres.2019.109023,Universidad Nacional Costa Rica,"Background Although epidemiologic studies suggest that early immune stimulation is protective against childhood leukemia, evidence for this relationship is equivocal for Hispanic children, who are disproportionately affected by this disease. The complex biological processes underlying immune stimulation and leukemogenesis may benefit from novel statistical approaches that account for mixed exposures and their nonlinear interactions. In this study, we utilized targeted machine learning and traditional statistical methods to investigate the association of multiple measures of early immune stimulation with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Costa Rican children.
Materials and methods: We used data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Costa Rica (2001-2003). Cases of ALL (n = 240) were diagnosed in 1995-2000 (age > 1 year and < 15 years at diagnosis) and were identified through the National Cancer Registry and National Children's Hospital. Population controls (n = 578) were frequency-matched to cases by birth year and drawn from the National Birth Registry. Data on surrogate measures of early immune stimulation were collected through in-home interviews. We fitted multivariable models, utilizing targeted causal inference (varimpact), unconditional logistic regression, and latent class analysis (LCA).
Results: In varimpact analysis, contact with any pet [risk difference (RD) = - 0.17, 95% CI: - 0.25, - 0.10)] or any farm animal (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.00) and allergies (RD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.17, 0.01) were associated with a reduced risk of ALL, whereas experiencing a fever longer than one week was associated with an increased risk (RD = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.33). In unconditional logistic regression models, contact with any pet or farm animal and a complete vaccination scheme were inversely associated with odds of ALL (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.62; OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.90; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.83; respectively), whereas experiencing a fever longer than one week was positively associated with ALL (OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.61, 3.70). Twoclass and three-class LCA revealed a group with elevated risk for ALL whose exposure profile was mainly characterized by reduced exposure to pets and farm animals.
Conclusions: Using distinct statistical approaches, we observed that exposure to pets and farm animals was inversely associated with ALL risk, whereas having a fever longer than one week (a putative proxy of severe infection) was associated with an increased risk. For multifactorial diseases such as childhood leukemia, we recommend estimating the joint effects of multiple exposures by applying diverse statistical methods and interpreting their results together. Overall, we found support for the hypothesis that early immune stimulation offers protection against childhood ALL.","Childhood cancer,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Early immune stimulation,Hispanic children,Costa Rica,Machine learning",Article,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE, 525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,6.824,"DAY-CARE,ATTENDANCE,CANCER,STATISTICS,RISK,INFECTIONS,ASSOCIATION,EXPOSURE,ALLERGY",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605596,
6,Unveiling the Diversity of Tree Growth Patterns in Boreal Old-Growth Forests Reveals the Richness of Their Dynamics,11,3,,"Martin Maxence,Krause Cornelia,Fenton Nicole J.,Morin Hubert","Martin M,Krause C,Fenton NJ,Morin H",Martin M,10.3390/f11030252,University of Quebec,"Research Highlights: Radial growth patterns of trees growing in old-growth boreal forests in eastern Canada can be grouped into a small number of simple patterns that are specific to different old-growth forest types or successional stages. Background and Objectives: Identifying the main radial growth trends in old-growth forests could help to develop silvicultural treatments that mimic the complex dynamics of old-growth forests. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the main radial growth patterns and determine how their frequencies change during forest succession in old-growth forests, focusing on boreal landscapes in eastern Canada. Materials and Methods: We used dendrochronological data sampled from 21 old-growth stands in the province of Quebec, Canada. Tree-ring chronologies were simplified into chronologies of equal length to retain only primary growth trends. We used k-means clustering to identify individual growth patterns and the difference in growth-pattern frequency within the studied stands. We then used non-parametric analyses of variance to compare tree or stand characteristics among the clusters. Results: We identified six different growth patterns corresponding to four old-growth forest types, from stands at the canopy breakup stage to true old-growth stands (i.e., when all the pioneer cohort had disappeared). Secondary disturbances of low or moderate severity drove these growth patterns. Overall, the growth patterns were relatively simple and could be generally separated into two main phases (e.g., a phase of limited radial increment size due to juvenile suppression and a phase of increased radial increment size following a growth release). Conclusions: The complexity of old-growth forest dynamics was observed mainly at the stand level, not at the tree level. The growth patterns observed in true old-growth forests were similar to those observed following partial or stem-selection cuts in boreal stands; thus, these silvicultural treatments may be effective in mimicking old-growth dynamics.","overmature,succession,dendrochronology,growth release,primary forest,ecosystem-based management,close-to-nature silviculture,machine learning,clustering",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Forestry,,2.804,"DISTURBANCE-BASED,MANAGEMENT,BLACK,SPRUCE,SUSTAINABLE,MANAGEMENT,ABOVEGROUND,BIOMASS,STAND,STRUCTURE,FIR,FORESTS,RESTORATION,VARIABILITY,REGIME,CONSERVATION",FORESTS,https://constellation.uqac.ca/5511/1/Martin%20et%20al.%202020%20Unveiling%20The%20Diversity%20of%20Tree%20Growth%20Patterns%20in%20Boreal%20Old-Growth%20Forests%20Reveals%20the%20Richness%20of%20Their%20Dynamics.pdf,

Potential applications include non-destructive inspection for material crack detection using thermal imaging as well as real-time anomaly detection for process monitoring of three-dimensional printing applications. A neural network (NN) architecture is established that offers sufficient flexibility for spatial and temporal derivatives to capture the physical dependencies inherent in the process. Predictive capabilities are then established by propagating the process forward in time using the acquired model structure as well as individual parameter values. Moreover, deviations in the predicted values can be monitored in real time to detect potential process anomalies or perturbations. For concept development and validation, this article utilizes well-understood PDEs such as the homogeneous heat diffusion equation. Time series data governed by the heat equation representing a parabolic PDE is generated using high-fidelity simulations in order to construct the heat profile. Model structure and parameter identification are realized through a shallow residual convolutional NN. The learned model structure and associated parameters resemble a spatial convolution filter, which can be applied to the current heat profile to predict the diffusion behavior forward in time.

Typically, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in a clinical environment by licensed specialists using procedures which can be lengthy and cost-ineffective. Therefore, scholars in the medical, psychology, and applied behavioral science fields have in recent decades developed screening methods such as the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers for diagnosing autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. The accuracy and efficiency of these screening methods rely primarily on the experience and knowledge of the user, as well as the items designed in the screening method. One promising direction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of autism spectrum disorder detection is to build classification systems using intelligent technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning offers advanced techniques that construct automated classifiers that can be exploited by users and clinicians to significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency in diagnostic discovery. This article proposes a new machine learning method called Rules-Machine Learning that not only detects autistic traits of cases and controls but also offers users knowledge bases (rules) that can be utilized by domain experts in understanding the reasons behind the classification.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has become an important public health concern. Polysomnography is traditionally considered an established and effective diagnostic tool providing information on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the degree of sleep fragmentation. However, the numerous steps in the polysomnography test to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are costly and time consuming. This study aimed to test the efficacy and clinical applicability of different machine learning methods based on demographic information and questionnaire data to predict obstructive sleep apnea syndrome severity.
Materials and methods:
We collected data about demographic characteristics, spirometry values, gas exchange (PaO2, PaCO2) and symptoms (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, snoring, etc.) of 313 patients with previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. After principal component analysis, we selected 19 variables which were used for further preprocessing and to eventually train seven types of classification models and five types of regression models to evaluate the prediction ability of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome severity, represented either by class or by apnea-hypopnea index. All models are trained with an increasing number of features and the results are validated through stratified 10-fold cross validation.
Results:
Comparative results show the superiority of support vector machine and random forest models for classification, while support vector machine and linear regression are better suited to predict apnea-hypopnea index. Also, a limited number of features are enough to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. The best average classification accuracy on test sets is 44.7 percent, with the same average sensitivity (recall). In only 5.7 percent of cases, a severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (class 4) is misclassified as mild (class 2). Regression results show a minimum achieved root mean squared error of 22.17.
Conclusion:
The problem of predicting apnea-hypopnea index or severity classes for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is very difficult when using only data collected prior to polysomnography test. The results achieved with the available data suggest the use of machine learning methods as tools for providing patients with a priority level for polysomnography test, but they still cannot be used for automated diagnosis.","machine learning,obstructive sleep apnea syndrome",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,3.0,"BERLIN,QUESTIONNAIRE,GENERAL-POPULATION,PREVALENCE,DISEASE,RISK,STOP",HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1460458218824725,

We document a clear rise in the extramural influence of economic research, while also showing that economics is increasingly likely to reference other social sciences. A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field influence. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics' extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work.

In non-neural organisms such as slime mold with gel-like media, viscosity modulation enables adaptation to changing environments. At a larger scale, collective intelligence emerges via social interactions and feedback in animal colonies. Learning and memory are therefore multi-scale features that evolve as a result of constant interactions with the environment. There is growing interest in emulating such features of intelligence in computing machines and autonomous systems. Materials that can respond to their environment in a manner similar to organisms (referred to as ""organismic materials"") therefore may be of interest as hardware components in artificial intelligence machines. In this brief review, we present a class of semiconductors called correlated oxides as candidates for learning machines. The term ""correlated"" refers to the fact that electrons in such lattices strongly interact and the ground state is not what is predicted by classical band theory. Such materials can undergo insulator-metal transitions at near ambient conditions under external stimuli such as thermal or electrical fields, strain, and chemical doping. Depending on the mechanism driving the transition, intermediate states can be metastable with different volatilities, and the time scales of phase change can be controlled over many orders of magnitude. The change in electronic properties can be sharp or gradual, leading to digital or analog behavior. These properties enable the realization of artificial neurons and synapses and emulate the associative and non-associative learning characteristics found in various organisms. We examine microscopic properties concerning electronic and structural transitions leading to collective behavior and theoretical treatments of the ground state and dynamical response, showcasing VO2 as a model system. Next, we briefly review algorithms designed from the plasticity demonstrated by phase changing systems. We conclude the brief review with suggestions for future research toward realizing non-von Neumann machines.","METAL-INSULATOR-TRANSITION,PHASE-TRANSITION,ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,OXYGEN VACANCIES,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MOTT-INSULATOR,STRAIN CONTROL,THIN-FILMS,PEROVSKITE",Review,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Physics,,19.201,"METAL-INSULATOR-TRANSITION,PHASE-TRANSITION,ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,OXYGEN,VACANCIES,NEURAL-NETWORKS,MOTT-INSULATOR,STRAIN,CONTROL,THIN-FILMS,PEROVSKITE",APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS,,

Four parameters of feed rate, spindle speed, drilling diameter, and cushion plate were taken as the input layer parameters to study the manufacturing quality of holes in four stack types: CFRP/Al, Al/CFRP, Al/CFRP/Al, and CFRP/Al/CFRP. Delamination and tearing defects often appear in the drilling process; thus, a certain degree of defects in CFRP was selected as the output parameter, in an effort to build a prediction model of drilling quality. After the neural network model of the optimized hole-making process of an 8-14-1 three-layer topology was corrected by 170 steps, the error was reduced to 0.00016882, the regression fitting was 0.99978, and the fitting error of training samples was 10(-2)similar to 10(-5). The prediction model of the number of defective holes provided basically similar results to the experimental data. This indicates that the prediction model based on a BP neural network has good prediction ability. Based on the prediction of parameters, verification tests were performed, and the number of defective holes in CFRP was reduced while the manufacturing quality of the holes was improved significantly; the qualified rate of manufactured holes reached 97%.","neural network algorithms,CFRP,drilling,quality prediction",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,DELAMINATION,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/6/2108/pdf,

A Review,10,6,,"Kandel Ibrahem,Castelli Mauro","Kandel I,Castelli M",Kandel I,10.3390/app10062021,Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a dangerous eye condition that affects diabetic patients. Without early detection, it can affect the retina and may eventually cause permanent blindness. The early diagnosis of DR is crucial for its treatment. However, the diagnosis of DR is a very difficult process that requires an experienced ophthalmologist. A breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence called deep learning can help in giving the ophthalmologist a second opinion regarding the classification of the DR by using an autonomous classifier. To accurately train a deep learning model to classify DR, an enormous number of images is required, and this is an important limitation in the DR domain. Transfer learning is a technique that can help in overcoming the scarcity of images. The main idea that is exploited by transfer learning is that a deep learning architecture, previously trained on non-medical images, can be fine-tuned to suit the DR dataset. This paper reviews research papers that focus on DR classification by using transfer learning to present the best existing methods to address this problem. This review can help future researchers to find out existing transfer learning methods to address the DR classification task and to show their differences in terms of performance.","Diabetic retinopathy,deep learning,convolutional neural networks,transfer learning",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"WORLDWIDE,MELLITUS",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/Dokument.php?lang=slv&id=139660&dn=,

Among the DCNNs, Modified-Alexnet, MobileNet, and Resnet50 were used, and the accuracy of the models was evaluated by performing 4-fold cross validation. Additionally, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to perform visualized interpretation to determine which region affected the DCNNs' class classification. The prediction accuracy of the models was 96.4% for Modified-Alexnet, 95.4% for MobileNet, and 95.6% for Resnet50. According to the Grad-CAM analysis, the most influential regions for the DCNNs' class classification were the maxillary and mandibular teeth, mandible, and mandibular symphysis.

The possibility of using a limited set of learning data was achieved by developing a detailed scenario of the task, which strictly defined the conditions of detector operation in the considered case of a convolutional neural network. The described solution utilizes known architectures of deep neural networks in the process of learning and object detection. The article presents comparisons of results from detecting the most popular deep neural networks while maintaining a limited training set composed of a specific number of selected images from diagnostic video. The analyzed input material was recorded during an inspection flight conducted along high-voltage lines. The object detector was built for a power insulator. The main contribution of the presented papier is the evidence that a limited training set (in our case, just 60 training frames) could be used for object detection, assuming an outdoor scenario with low variability of environmental conditions. The decision of which network will generate the best result for such a limited training set is not a trivial task. Conducted research suggests that the deep neural networks will achieve different levels of effectiveness depending on the amount of training data. The most beneficial results were obtained for two convolutional neural networks: the faster region-convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN) and the region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN). Faster R-CNN reached the highest AP (average precision) at a level of 0.8 for 60 frames. The R-FCN model gained a worse AP result; however, it can be noted that the relationship between the number of input samples and the obtained results has a significantly lower influence than in the case of other CNN models, which, in the authors' assessment, is a desired feature in the case of a limited training set.","convolutional neural network,deep neural network,insulator detection,efficiency evaluation,power system maintenance",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"DIGITAL,IMAGES",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/6/2104/pdf,

Stability and diagnostic power of 672 radiomic descriptors were investigated between the computerized segmentation, and 4 radiologists' annotations for the 35 test set cases. Feature stability and diagnostic performance in the discrimination between benign and malignant cases were quantified using intraclass correlation (ICC) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), performed for each segmentation case (4 radiologists and DL algorithm). DL-based segmentation resulted in a Conformity of 0.85 +/- 0.06 against the annotated ground truth. For the stability analysis, although modest agreement was found among the four annotations performed by radiologists (Conformity 0.78 +/- 0.03), over 90% of all radiomic features were found to be stable (ICC>0.75) across multiple segmentations. All MANOVA analyses were statistically significant (p <= 0.05), with all dimensions equal to 1, and Wilks' lambda <= 0.35. In conclusion, DL-based mass segmentation in dedicated breast CT images can achieve high segmentation performance, and demonstrated to provide stable radiomic descriptors with comparable discriminative power in the classification of benign and malignant tumors to expert radiologist annotation.","Breast cancer diagnosis,Breast CT,Convolutional neural networks,Deep learning,Radiomics",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,CLASSIFICATION",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103629,

Hence, the detection of HVDs at the initial stage is very important in cardiovascular engineering to reduce the mortality rate. In this article, we propose a new approach for the detection of HVDs using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The approach uses the Chirplet transform (CT) for the time-frequency (TF) based analysis of the PCG signal. The local energy (LEN) and local entropy (LENT) features are evaluated from the TF matrix of the PCG signal. The multiclass composite classifier formulated based on the sparse representation of the test PCG instance for each class and the distances from the nearest neighbor PCG instances are used for the classification of HVDs such as mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral stenosis (MS), aortic stenosis (AS), and healthy classes (HC). The experimental results show that the proposed approach has sensitivity values of 99.44%, 98.66%, and 96.22% respectively for AS, MS and MR classes. The classification results of the proposed CT based features are compared with existing approaches for the automated classification of HVDs. The proposed approach has obtained the highest overall accuracy as compared to existing methods using the same database. The approach can be considered for the automated detection of HVDs with the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT) applications.","Heart valve diseases (HVDs),PCG,Chirplet transform,Time-frequency analysis,Multiclass composite classifier",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"SOUND,ACTIVITY,DETECTION,DIAGNOSIS,PATHOGENESIS,SELECTION,NETWORKS,FEATURES",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

For these reasons, enhancing risk stratification in order to identify patients at high risk of clinical deterioration might benefit and improve the outcomes of critically ill hospitalized patients. Existing work on predicting ICU readmissions relies on information available at the time of discharge, however, in order to be more useful and to prevent complications, predictions need to be made earlier. Goals: In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the basal characteristics and information collected at the time of the patient's admission can enable accurate predictions of ICU readmission.
Materials and Methods: We analyzed an anonymized dataset of 11,805 adult patients from three ICUs in a Brazilian university hospital. After excluding 1879 patients who died during their first ICU admission, our final dataset contained 9,926 patients. Of these, 658 patients (6.6%) had been readmitted to the ICU. The original dataset had 185 attributes, including demographics, length of stay prior to ICU admission, comorbidities, severity indexes, interventions, organ support care during ICU stay and laboratory results. The problem of predicting ICU readmissions was modeled as a binary classification task. We tested eight classification algorithms (including Bayesian algorithms, decision trees, rule-based, and ensemble methods) over different sets of attributes and evaluated their results based on six metrics.
Results: Predictions made solely based on the attributes collected at the admission are highly accurate. Their quality in terms of prediction is no different from predictions made using the complete set of attributes for our dataset and for a subset of attributes selected by a feature selection method. Furthermore, our AUROC score of 0.91 (95% CI [0.89,0.92]) is higher than existing results published in the literature for other datasets.
Discussion and Conclusion: The results confirm our hypothesis. Our findings suggest that early markers can be used to anticipate patients at high risk of clinical deterioration after ICU discharge.","ICU readmission,Machine learning,Classification algorithms",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"RISK,MODELS",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103636,

Some symptoms of HPT include headaches, dizziness and fainting. The potential diagnosis of masked hypertension is of specific interest in this study. In masked hypertension (MHPT), the instantaneous blood pressure appears normal, but the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure is abnormal. Hence patients with MHPT are difficult to identify and thus remain untreated or are treated insufficiently. Hence, a computational intelligence tool (CIT) using electrocardiograms (ECG) signals for HPT and possible MHPT detection is proposed in this work. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the pre-processed signals up to five levels. Nonlinear features are extracted from the five intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) thereafter. Student's t-test is subsequently applied to select a set of highly discriminatory features. This feature set is then input to various classifiers, in which, the best accuracy of 97.70% is yielded by the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The developed tool is evaluated by the 10-fold cross validation technique. Our findings suggest that the developed system is useful for diagnostic computational intelligence tool in hospital settings, and that it enables the automatic classification of HPT versus normal ECG signals.","Hypertension,Masked hypertension,Computer intelligence tool,Empirical mode decomposition,Nonlinear features,Student's t-test,10-fold validation,Machine-learning",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"MASKED,HYPERTENSION,WHITE-COAT,IDENTIFICATION,ENTROPY",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

Because the postoperative appearance can significantly change, sometimes it is difficult to make decisions regarding decompression surgery. Herein, we present a deep learning technique to synthesize the realistic postoperative appearance for orbital decompression surgery.
Methods: This data-driven approach is based on a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to transform preoperative facial input images into predicted postoperative images. The conditional GAN model was trained on 109 pairs of matched pre- and postoperative facial images through data augmentation.
Results: When the conditional variable was changed, the synthesized facial image was transferred from a preoperative image to a postoperative image. The predicted postoperative images were similar to the ground truth postoperative images. We also found that GAN-based synthesized images can improve the deep learning classification performance between the pre- and postoperative status using a small training dataset. However, a relatively low quality of synthesized images was noted after a readout by clinicians.
Conclusions: Using this framework, we synthesized TAO facial images that can be queried using conditioning on the orbital decompression status. The synthesized postoperative images may be helpful for patients in determining the impact of decompression surgery. However, the quality of the generated image should be further improved. The proposed deep learning technique based on a GAN can rapidly synthesize such realistic images of the postoperative appearance, suggesting that a GAN can function as a decision support tool for plastic and cosmetic surgery techniques.","Generative adversarial network,Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy,Orbital decompression,Postoperative appearance",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.9,"TO-IMAGE,TRANSLATION",COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,

Reflectance spectroscopy which is fast and cost-effective has been reported as an alternative method for estimating Atterberg limits. To assess the efficiency of the method, 60 forest soil samples were measured by visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) within the range of 350-2500 nm. The Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing method for spectral data was used to reduce signal noise and the first derivative reflectance (DR) was applied to accentuate the features and assemble the data for use in the modeling process. In this study, raw reflectance (R) and first derivative reflectance (DR) data were used to estimate Atterberg limits. All two-band combinations of three types of spectra (ratio index, normalized difference index and difference index) as well as PLS and PLS-BPNN were calculated to extract optimum waveband combination and calibrations between Atterberg limits and reflectance spectra. The correlation coefficients between Atterberg limits and reflectance spectra indicated both positive and negative correlation at various wavelengths across the spectrum. The highest correlation for liquid limit (r = - 0.86), plastic limit (r = - 0.76) and plasticity index (r = - 0.7) was found at 1921, 1938 and 1913 nm, respectively. In addition, the results showed the spectral indices technique as a good method for estimating soil plasticity and improving the prediction accuracy of Atterberg limits. In the current study, PLS and PLS-BPNN were also used to develop the calibration models for estimating Atterberg limits using R and DR. The results demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of PLS-BPNN for both R and DR was higher than that of PLS. Correlation coefficients between shrinkage limit (SL) and reflectance spectra showed weak correlation, and overall reflectance had the same correlation. The results represented that this method could be used to estimate soil plasticity properties quickly, non-destructively, and with minimal sample preparation and high accuracy. These advantages may be more important, especially when a huge number of samples should be tested and analyzed within a short period of time.","Ratio index,Normalized difference index,Difference index,Wavelengths",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"NEAR-INFRARED,SPECTROSCOPY,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINES,ORGANIC-MATTER,CLAY,REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION",GEODERMA,,

PPG is easily contaminated by motion artifacts (MA), hindering estimation of HR. For quasi-periodic motions, previous works generally focused on a few specific motions, such as walking and fast running. However, they may not work well for many different quasi-periodic motions where MA are very complex. In this paper, a robust HR monitoring scheme for different quasi-periodic motions using wrist-type PPG is proposed, which consists of dictionary learning for signal characteristics learning, human motion recognition for the current motion recognition and dictionary selection, sparse representation-based MA elimination for denoising, and spectral peak tracking for HR-related spectral peak tracking. The proposed scheme is robust to MA caused by different motions and has high accuracy. Experiments on six common quasi-periodic motions showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.40 beat per minute, and also showed that the proposed method is more robust than some state-of-the-art approaches for different motions.","Acceleration,Monitoring,Dictionaries,Heart rate,Legged locomotion,Machine learning,Motion segmentation,Heart rate monitoring,photoplethysmography (PPG),motion artifacts,sparse representation,wearable sensors",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHIC,SIGNALS,REDUCTION,DECOMPOSITION,ARTIFACTS,ALGORITHM",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,,

New tools for monitoring cardiac rhythm are important for risk stratification and stroke prevention. As many of new approaches to long-term AFib detection are now based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings from wearable devices, ensuring high PPG signal-to-noise ratios is a fundamental requirement for a robust detection of AFib episodes. Traditionally, signal quality assessment is often based on the evaluation of similarity between pulses to derive signal quality indices. There are limitations to using this approach for accurate assessment of PPG quality in the presence of arrhythmia, as in the case of AFib, mainly due to substantial changes in pulse morphology. In this paper, we first tested the performance of algorithms selected from a body of studies on PPG quality assessment using a dataset of PPG recordings from patients with AFib. We then propose machine learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in 30-s segments of PPG recording from 13 stroke patients admitted to the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) neuro intensive care unit and another dataset of 3764 patients from one of the five UCSF general intensive care units.

Historical data of the subjects acquired from a period sufficiently before the clinical suspicion of LOS was used as control state, whereas data from the 24 h preceding the clinical suspicion of LOS were used as sepsis state (test data). The overall prognostic potential of all features was quantified at three-hourly intervals for the period corresponding to test data by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. For the 49 infants studied, features of HRV, respiration, and movement showed characteristic changes in the hours leading up to the clinical suspicion of sepsis, namely, an increased propensity toward pathological heart rate decelerations, increased respiratory instability, and a decrease in spontaneous infant activity, i.e., lethargy. While features characterizing HRV and respiration can be used to probe the state of the autonomic nervous system, those characterizing movement probe the state of the motor system-dysregulation of both reflects an increased likelihood of sepsis.

At present, there are no objective, non-verbal, automated markers that can reliably track treatment response. Here, we explore the use of video analysis of facial expressivity in a cohort of severely depressed patients before and after deep brain stimulation (DBS), an experimental treatment for depression. We introduced a set of variability measurements to obtain unsupervised features from muted video recordings, which were then leveraged to build predictive models to classify three levels of severity in the patients' recovery from depression. Multiscale entropy was utilized to estimate the variability in pixel intensity level at various time scales. A dynamic latent variable model was utilized to learn a low-dimensional representation of factors that describe the dynamic relationship between high-dimensional pixels in each video frame and over time.

The goal of this study was to use machine learning algorithms to classify patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using activity tracker data in a cohort of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). A population of 182 patients with SIHD were monitored over a period of 12 weeks. Each subject received a Fitbit Charge 2 device to record daily activity data, and each subject completed eight Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems short form at the end of each week as a self-assessment of their health status. Two models were built to classify PRO scores using activity tracker data. The first model treated each week independently, whereas the second used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to take advantage of correlations between successive weeks. Retrospective analysis compared the classification accuracy of the two models and the importance of each feature. In the independent model, a random forest classifier achieved a mean area under curve (AUC) of 0.76 for classifying the physical function PRO. The HMM model achieved significantly better AUCs for all PROs (p < 0.05) other than Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance, with a highest mean AUC of 0.79 for the physical function-short form 10a.

Since traditional identification methods depend on a series of instruments which induce considerable time and economic cost, it is crucial to employ an efficient and effective method to discriminate coal origin. As a rapid, non-destructive, and reagent-free analytical method, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) enables rapid qualitative and quantitative characterization of a wide variety of materials, such as food and fuel. In this work, different multivariate data analysis approaches based on NIRS data are investigated to identify the geographical origin of coal. Considering that raw spectra are in high-dimensional spaces, principle component analysis (PCA), isometric mapping (Isomap) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are introduced to extract features. However, given the classes with similar centers, it is difficult to separate them via the standard LDA because it overvalues the contributions of the edge classes to the between-class scatter matrix. To address this concern, we propose an improved LDA (iLDA) in consideration of the contribution of each class, and enhance the impact of the classes with similar centers. In addition, we combine PCA and iLDA to solve the small sample size problem. The experimental results show that nonlinear approaches outperform linear approaches generally, and kernel partial least squares discriminant analysis combined with PCA-iLDA provides the best performance with the accuracy of 97.21%. The obtained results indicate that NIRS in tandem with different machine learning algorithms are promising for the rapid and accurate identification of coal geographical origin.","Near-infrared spectroscopy,Coal geographical origin identification,Dimensionality reduction,Improved linear discriminant analysis",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,2.581,"NIR,SPECTROSCOPY,CLASSIFICATION,AUTHENTICATION,IDENTIFICATION,QUALITY",INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY,,

This family of 2D materials contains more than 400 members, including (a) elemental group-V materials, (b) binary III-VII and IV-VI compounds, (c) ternary III-VI-VII and IV-V-VII compounds, making materials design with targeted functionality unprecedentedly rich and extremely challenging. To shed light on rational functionality design with this family of materials, we systemically explore their fundamental band gaps and alignments using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination with machine learning. First, calculations are performed using both the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional within the general-gradient-density approximation (GGA-PBE) and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE) as a reference. We find this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess largely distributed band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 eV to 8 eV. Then, we apply machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), and support vector machine regression (SVR), to build models for the prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is found to have the best performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.15 eV for the predicted band gaps, valence-band maximums (VBMs), and conduction-band minimums (CBMs) when both PBE results and elemental information are used as features.

Then a machine learning (ML)-based prediction tool, the K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR), was used to investigate HDTs of various bio-composite compositions. KNNR was employed in this study versus the Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and Adaptive Boosting Regressor (ABR) ML approaches utilized in the previous study by Daghigh et al.

As a result, this issue has become a major barrier to predicting the phase change of materials and their transport properties with atomistic-level modeling techniques. Recently, machine learning-based algorithms have emerged as promising tools to develop accurate potentials for MD simulations. In this work, we approach the problem of predicting the thermal conductivity of silicon in different phases by performing MD simulations with a deep neural network potential (NNP). This NNP is trained with ab initio data of silicon in the crystalline, liquid, and amorphous phases. The accuracy of our potential is first validated through reproducing the atomistic structures during the phase transition, where other empirical potentials usually fail. The thermal conductivity of different phases is then calculated, showing a good agreement with the experimental results and ab initio calculation results. Our work shows that a unified neural network ebased potential can be a promising tool for studying phase change and thermal transport of materials with high accuracy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The detection of reference objects is the key step to obtain waterlogging depths from video images. Object detection models with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized to detect reference objects. These models require a large number of labeled images as the training data to ensure the applicability at a city scale. However, it is hard to collect a sufficient number of urban flooding images containing valuable reference objects, and manually labeling images is time-consuming and expensive. To solve the problem, we present a method to synthesize image data as the training data. Firstly, original images containing reference objects and original images with water surfaces are collected from open data sources, and reference objects and water surfaces are cropped from these original images. Secondly, the reference objects and water surfaces are further enriched via data augmentation techniques to ensure the diversity. Finally, the enriched reference objects and water surfaces are combined to generate a synthetic image dataset with annotations. The synthetic image dataset is further used for training an object detection model with CNN. The waterlogging depths are calculated based on the reference objects detected by the trained model. A real video dataset and an artificial image dataset are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the detection model trained using the synthetic image dataset can effectively detect reference objects from images, and it can achieve acceptable accuracies of waterlogging depths based on the detected reference objects.

Non-invasive surface EMG (sEMG)-based pattern recognition methods have shown the potential for upper limb prosthesis control. However, it is still insufficient for natural control. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown tremendous progress in biosignal processing. Multiple architectures have been proposed yielding high accuracies (>95%) for offline analysis, yet the delay caused due to optimization of the system remains a challenge for its real-time application. From this arises a need for optimized deep learning architecture based on fine-tuned hyper-parameters. Although the chance of achieving convergence is random, however, it is important to observe that the performance gain made is significant enough to justify extra computation. In this study, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to decode hand gestures from the sEMG data recorded from 18 subjects to investigate the effect of hyper-parameters on each hand gesture. Results showed that the learning rate set to either 0.0001 or 0.001 with 80-100 epochs significantly outperformed (p < 0.05) other considerations.

Twenty-six healthy subjects equipped with eight wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) performed manual material handling tasks, such as lifting and releasing small loads, with two postural patterns: correctly and incorrectly. Measurements of kinematic parameters, such as the range of motion of lower limb and lumbosacral joints, along with the displacement of the trunk with respect to the pelvis, were estimated from IMU measurements through a biomechanical model. Statistical differences were found for all kinematic parameters between the correct and the incorrect postures (p < 0.01). Moreover, with the weight increase of load in the lifting task, changes in hip and trunk kinematics were observed (p < 0.01). To automatically identify the two postures, a supervised machine-learning algorithm, a support vector machine, was trained, and an accuracy of 99.4% (specificity of 100%) was reached by using the measurements of all kinematic parameters as features.

It is also associated with a high mortality index. Diabetic foot is one of its main complications, and it comprises the development of plantar ulcers that could result in an amputation. Several works report that thermography is useful to detect changes in the plantar temperature, which could give rise to a higher risk of ulceration. However, the plantar temperature distribution does not follow a particular pattern in diabetic patients, thereby making it difficult to measure the changes. Thus, there is an interest in improving the success of the analysis and classification methods that help to detect abnormal changes in the plantar temperature. All this leads to the use of computer-aided systems, such as those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), which operate with highly complex data structures. This paper compares machine learning-based techniques with Deep Learning (DL) structures. We tested common structures in the mode of transfer learning, including AlexNet and GoogleNet. Moreover, we designed a new DL-structure, which is trained from scratch and is able to reach higher values in terms of accuracy and other quality measures. The main goal of this work is to analyze the use of AI and DL for the classification of diabetic foot thermograms, highlighting their advantages and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of DL networks applied to the classification of diabetic foot thermograms. The experiments are conducted over thermograms of DM and control groups. After that, a multi-level classification is performed based on a previously reported thermal change index.

In this case, the classification was done by using a support vector machine. Just as in the first method, the sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity coefficient and accuracy are determined. A comparison of the obtained results from all the methods is then done. As mentioned above, the novelty of this paper is the integration of these methods in a global fusion-based decision system that uses the results obtained by each individual method to establish the fusion weights. The results obtained by carrying out the experiments on two different free databases shows that the proposed system offers higher accuracy results.","image processing,deep learning,machine learning,convolutional neural network,artificial intelligence,skin lesion detection,neural network,dermoscopic image",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,,SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/6/1753/pdf,

HTC VIVE is a popular device that provides a convenient way of capturing human motions using several sensors. Recently, the motion of only users' hands has been captured, thereby greatly reducing the range of motion captured. This paper proposes a framework to estimate single-arm orientations using soft sensors mainly by combining a Bi-long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and two-layer LSTM. Positions of the two hands are measured using an HTC VIVE set, and the orientations of a single arm, including its corresponding upper arm and forearm, are estimated using the proposed framework based on the estimated positions of the two hands. Given that the proposed framework is meant for a single arm, if orientations of two arms are required to be estimated, the estimations are performed twice. To obtain the ground truth of the orientations of single-arm movements, two Myo gesture-control sensory armbands are employed on the single arm: one for the upper arm and the other for the forearm. The proposed framework analyzed the contextual features of consecutive sensory arm movements, which provides an efficient way to improve the accuracy of arm movement estimation. In comparison with the ground truth, the proposed method estimated the arm movements using a dynamic time warping distance, which was the average of 73.90% less than that of a conventional Bayesian framework. The distinct feature of our proposed framework is that the number of sensors attached to end-users is reduced. Additionally, with the use of our framework, the arm orientations can be estimated with any soft sensor, and good accuracy of the estimations can be ensured. Another contribution is the suggestion of the combination of the Bi-LSTM and two-layer LSTM.","human motion capture,movement estimation,HTC VIVE,Myo armband,soft sensor",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,KINECT,SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7146561?pdf=render,

Recent breakthroughs have enabled the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) directly to point clouds, an efficient and natural representation of 3D objects. The potential of these methods has mostly been demonstrated for classification and segmentation tasks involving rigid man-made objects. We present a method, based on the successful PointNet architecture, for learning to regress correct tool placement from human demonstrations, using virtual reality. Our method is applied to a challenging slaughterhouse cutting task, which requires an understanding of the local geometry including the shape, size, and orientation. We propose an intermediate five-Degree of Freedom (DoF) cutting plane representation, a point and a normal vector, which eases the demonstration and learning process. A live experiment is conducted in order to unveil issues and begin to understand the required accuracy. Eleven cuts are rated by an expert, with 8/11 being rated as acceptable. The error on the test set is subsequently reduced through the addition of more training data and improvements to the DNN. The result is a reduction in the average translation from 1.5 cm to 0.8 cm and the orientation error from 4.59 degrees to 4.48 degrees. The method's generalization capacity is assessed on a similar task from the slaughterhouse and on the very different public LINEMOD dataset for object pose estimation across view points.

Traditional feature engineering methods based on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and data representation ability, so the traditional research on pattern recognition of arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, with the increase of deep learning technology, automatic feature extraction of ECG data based on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the complementary strength between different schemes, in this paper, we propose an arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation (MRR) of ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based representations, together with hand-crafted features of ECG, forms the MRR, which is the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed method is 0.9238, which is 1.31%, 0.62%, 1.18% and 0.6% higher than that of each channel model.

This allows users to track their exercise through the phone and share information with other players and referees. Considering the complexity of the classification algorithm and the user-friendliness of the measurement system, the improved multi-layer hybrid clustering model applies three-level K-means clustering to optimize feature extraction and segmentation and then uses the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to determine the feature center of different movements.

Recently, the early diagnosis and accurate prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have been planned to be estimated according to precise and reliable methods, artificial networks and machine learning (ML).
Materials and methods: In this study, an experimental data set of relevant features (adipocytokines and anthropometric levels) obtained from obese women (diabetic and non-diabetic) was analyzed. Machine learning was used to select significant features [by the separability-correlation measure (SCM) algorithm] for classification of women with the best accuracy and the results were evaluated using an artificial neural network (ANN).
Results: According to the experimental data analysis, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and visfatin level in two groups. Moreover, significant correlations were determined between HbA(1c) and FBS, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and insulin, total cholesterol (TC) level and body mass index (BMI) in non-diabetic women and insulin and HOMA, FBS and HbA(1c), insulin and HOMA, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), BMI and TC and HbA(1c) and TC in the diabetic group. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between adipocytokines except for the resistin and leptin levels for both groups. The excellent (FBS and HbA(1c)), good (HOMA) and fair (visfatin, adiponectin and insulin) discriminators of diabetic women were determined based on specificities and sensitivities level. The more selected features in the ML method were FBS, apelin, visfatin, TC, HbA(1c) and adiponectin.
Conclusions: Thus, the subset of features involving FBS, apelin, visfatin and HbA(1c) are significant features and make the best discrimination between groups. In this study, based on statistical and ML results, the useful biomarkers for discrimination of diabetic women were FBS, HbA(1c), HOMA, insulin, visfatin, adiponectin and apelin.

These contrasts capture information associated with the same underlying anatomy and thus exhibit similarities in either structure level or gray level. In this paper, we propose a coupled dictionary learning based multi-contrast MRI reconstruction (CDLMRI) approach to leverage the dependency correlation between different contrasts for guided or joint reconstruction from their under-sampled k-space data. Our approach iterates between three stages: coupled dictionary learning, coupled sparse denoising, and enforcing k-space consistency. The first stage learns a set of dictionaries that not only are adaptive to the contrasts, but also capture correlations among multiple contrasts in a sparse transform domain. By capitalizing on the learned dictionaries, the second stage performs coupled sparse coding to remove the aliasing and noise in the corrupted contrasts. The third stage enforces consistency between the denoised contrasts and the measurements in the k-space domain. Numerical experiments, consisting of retrospective under-sampling of various MRI contrasts with a variety of sampling schemes, demonstrate that CDLMRI is capable of capturing structural dependencies between different contrasts.

Each temporal-domain MR image is viewed as a point that lies onto or close to a smooth manifold, and landmark points are identified to describe the point cloud concisely. To facilitate computations, a dimensionality reduction module generates low-dimensional/compressed renditions of the landmark points. Recovery of high-fidelity MRI data is realized by solving a non-convex minimization task for the linear decompression operator and affine combinations of landmark points which locally approximate the latent manifold geometry. An algorithm with guaranteed convergence to stationary solutions of the non-convex minimization task is also provided. The aforementioned framework exploits the underlying spatio-temporal patterns and geometry of the acquired data without any prior training on external data or information.

We compare our approach to two 2D and a 3D deep learning-based post processing methods, three iterative reconstruction methods and two recently proposed methods for dynamic cardiac MRI based on 2D and 3D cascaded networks. Our method outperforms the 2D spatially trained U-net and the 2D spatio-temporal U-net. Compared to the 3D spatio-temporal U-net, our method delivers comparable results, but requiring shorter training times and less training data. Compared to the compressed sensing-based methods kt-FOCUSS and a total variation regularized reconstruction approach, our method improves image quality with respect to all reported metrics. Further, it achieves competitive results when compared to the iterative reconstruction method based on adaptive regularization with dictionary learning and total variation and when compared to the methods based on cascaded networks, while only requiring a small fraction of the computational and training time. A persistent homology analysis demonstrates that the data manifold of the spatio-temporal domain has a lower complexity than the one of the spatial domain and therefore, the learning of a projection-like mapping is facilitated. Even when trained on only one single subject without data-augmentation, our approach yields results which are similar to the ones obtained on a large training dataset. This makes the method particularly suitable for training a network on limited training data.

However, automated prostate segmentation from 3D MR images faces several challenges. The lack of clear edge between the prostate and other anatomical structures makes it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries. The complex background texture and large variation in size, shape and intensity distribution of the prostate itself make segmentation even further complicated. Recently, as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emerging as the best performed methods for medical image segmentation, the difficulty in obtaining large number of annotated medical images for training CNNs has become much more pronounced than ever. Since large-scale dataset is one of the critical components for the success of deep learning, lack of sufficient training data makes it difficult to fully train complex CNNs. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a boundary-weighted domain adaptive neural network (BOWDA-Net). To make the network more sensitive to the boundaries during segmentation, a boundary-weighted segmentation loss is proposed. Furthermore, an advanced boundary-weighted transfer leaning approach is introduced to address the problem of small medical imaging datasets.

However, bony boundaries are blurry in MRI, and structural information needs to be borrowed from CT during the training. This is challenging since paired MRI-CT data are typically scarce. In this paper, we propose to make full use of unpaired data, which are typically abundant, along with a single paired MRI-CT data to construct a one-shot generative adversarial model for automated MRI segmentation of CMF bony structures. Our model consists of a cross- modality image synthesis sub- network, which learns the mapping between CT and MRI, and an MRI segmentation sub- network. These two sub-networks are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, in the training phase, a neighbor- based anchoring method is proposed to reduce the ambiguity problem inherent in cross-modality synthesis, and a feature- matching- based semantic consistency constraint is proposed to encourage segmentation- oriented MRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison with the state-of-the-art MRI segmentation methods.","Craniomaxillofacial bone segmentation,MRI,generative adversarial learning,one-shot learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,IMAGE,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219540,

This brain activity is often reflected as distinct patterns of event-related potentials (ERPs) that can be employed in the detection and interpretation of the cerebral responses to erroneous stimuli. However, high-accuracy cross-condition classification is challenging due to the significant variations of the error-related ERP components (ErrPs) between complexity conditions, thus hindering the development of error recognition systems. In this study, we employed support vector machines (SVM) classification methods, based on waveform characteristics of ErrPs from different time windows, to detect correct and incorrect responses in an audio identification task with two conditions of different complexity. Since the performance of the classifiers usually depends on the salience of the features employed, a combination of the sequential forward floating feature selection (SFFS) and sequential forward feature selection (SFS) methods was implemented to detect condition-independent and condition-specific feature subsets. Our framework achieved high accuracy using a small subset of the available features both for cross- and within-condition classification, hence supporting the notion that machine learning techniques can detect hidden patterns of ErrP-based features, irrespective of task complexity while additionally elucidating complexity-related error processing variations.

Imaging based early diagnosis and image guided treatment are emerging potential solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help provide and improve widespread diagnostic expertise and accurate interventional image interpretation. Accurate segmentation of the pancreas is essential to create annotated data sets to train AI, and for computer assisted interventional guidance. Automated deep learning segmentation performance in pancreas computed tomography (CT) imaging is low due to poor grey value contrast and complex anatomy. A good solution seemed a recent interactive deep learning segmentation framework for brain CT that helped strongly improve initial automated segmentation with minimal user input. This method yielded no satisfactory results for pancreas CT, possibly due to a sub-optimal neural network architecture. We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art U-net neural network architecture is better because it can produce a better initial segmentation and is likely to be extended to work in a similar interactive approach. We implemented the existing interactive method, iFCN, and developed an interactive version of U-net method we call iUnet. The iUnet is fully trained to produce the best possible initial segmentation. In interactive mode it is additionally trained on a partial set of layers on user generated scribbles. We compare initial segmentation performance of iFCN and iUnet on a 100CT dataset using dice similarity coefficient analysis. Secondly, we assessed the performance gain in interactive use with three observers on segmentation quality and time. Average automated baseline performance was 78% (iUnet) versus 72% (FCN). Manual and semi-automatic segmentation performance was: 87% in 15 min. for manual, and 86% in 8 min. for iUNet. We conclude that iUnet provides a better baseline than iFCN and can reach expert manual performance significantly faster than manual segmentation in case of pancreas CT. Our novel iUnet architecture is modality and organ agnostic and can be a potential novel solution for semi-automatic medical imaging segmentation in general.","deep learning,pancreatic cancer,interactive segmentation,U-net",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"IMAGE,QUALITY",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10092167/1/Boers%2Bet%2Bal_2020_Phys_Med_Biol_101088_1361-6560_ab6f99.pdf,

As a pilot study, we synthesize CT and CBCT textures in the chest region.
For training purposes, major organs and gross tumor volumes (GTVs) in chest region were segmented from real patient images and assigned to different HU values to generate organ maps, which resemble the XCAT images. A dual-discriminator conditional-generative adversarial network (D-CGAN) was developed to synthesize anatomical textures in the corresponding organ maps. The D-CGAN was uniquely designed with two discriminators, one trained for the body and the other for the tumor. Various XCAT phantoms were input to the D-CGAN to generate textured XCAT phantoms. The D-CGAN model was trained separately using 62 CT and 63 CBCT images from lung SBRT patients to generate multi-contrast textured XCAT (MT-XCAT). The MT-XCAT phantoms were evaluated by comparing the intensity histograms and radiomic features with those from real patient images using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
The visual examination demonstrated that the MT-XCAT phantoms presented similar general contrast and anatomical textures as CT and CBCT images. The mean HU of the MT-XCAT-CT and MT-XCAT-CBCT were -140.35 +/- 336.48 and -185.72 +/- 350.32, compared with that of real CT (-149.79 +/- 346.37) and CBCT (-245.41 +/- 371.66). The majority of radiomic features from the MTXCAT phantoms followed the same distribution as the real images according to the Wilcoxon ranksum test, except for limited second-order features.
The study demonstrated the feasibility of generating realistic MT-XCAT phantoms using D-CGAN. The MT-XCAT phantoms can be further expanded to include other modalities (MRI, PET, ultrasound, etc) under the same scheme. This crucial development greatly enhances the value of the phantom for various clinical applications, including testing and optimizing novel imaging techniques, validation of radiomics analysis methods, and virtual clinical trials.","XCAT phantom,generative adversarial network,multi-contrast,virtual trial",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,FEATURES,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7252912,

Compared to current model-based inverse methods, our approach requires neither geometric nor constitutive model assumptions. We build upon our previous report for 2D QUSE and demonstrate the feasibility of recovering the 3D linear-elastic material property distribution of gelatin phantoms under compressive loads. Measurements of boundary geometry, applied surface forces, and axial displacements enter into AutoP where a Cartesian neural network constitutive model (CaNNCM) interacts with finite element analyses to learn physically consistent material properties with no prior constitutive model assumption. We introduce a new regularization term uniquely suited to AutoP that improves the ability of CaNNCMs to extract information about spatial stress distributions from measurement data. Results of our study demonstrate that acquiring multiple sets of force-displacement measurements by moving the US probe to different locations on the phantom surface not only provides AutoP with the necessary information for a CaNNCM to learn the 3D material property distribution, but may significantly improve the accuracy of the Young's modulus estimates. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-offs of decreasing the contact area between the US transducer and phantom surface in an effort to increase sensitivity to surface force variations without additional instrumentation.

Recently, computational human models generated from medical images have often been used for such assessment, especially to consider the inter-subject variability. However, a common procedure to develop personalized models is time consuming because it involves excessive segmentation of several components that represent different biological tissues, which is a major obstacle in the inter-subject variability assessment of radiation safety. Deep learning methods have been shown to be a powerful approach for pattern recognition and signal analysis. Convolutional neural networks with deep architecture are proven robust for feature extraction and image mapping in several biomedical applications. In this study, we develop a learning-based approach for fast and accurate estimation of the dielectric properties and density of tissues directly from magnetic resonance images in a single shot. The smooth distribution of the dielectric properties in head models, which is realized using a process without tissue segmentation, improves the smoothness of the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution compared with that in the commonly used procedure. The estimated SAR distributions, as well as that averaged over 10 g of tissue in a cubic shape, are found to be highly consistent with those computed using the conventional methods that employ segmentation.","electromagnetic dosimetry,human safety,deep learning,specific absorption rate (SAR),radio frequency,CondNet",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS,HUMAN-BODY,SAR,VARIABILITY",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01220,

The GAN has been developed to fit the input sinogram with the model sinogram generated from the predicted reconstruction. Good quality reconstructions can be obtained during the minimization of the fitting errors. The reconstruction is a self-training procedure based on the physics model, instead of on training data. The algorithm showed significant improvements in the reconstruction accuracy, especially for missing-wedge tomography acquired at less than 180 degrees rotational range.

Yet, nearly all functional materials are still discovered by ""trial-and-error"", of which the lack of predictability affords a major materials bottleneck to technological innovation. The average ""molecule-to-market"" lead time for materials discovery is currently 20 years. This is far too long for industrial needs, as highlighted by the Materials Genome Initiative, which has ambitious targets of up to 4-fold reductions in average molecule-to-market lead times. Such a large step change in progress can only be realistically achieved if one adopts an entirely new approach to materials discovery. Fortunately, a fundamentally new approach to materials discovery has been emerging, whereby data science with artificial intelligence offers a prospective solution to speed up these average molecule-to-market lead times.
This approach is known as data-driven materials discovery. Its broad prospects have only recently become a reality, given the timely and major advances in ""big data"", artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC). Access to massive data sets has been stimulated by government-regulated open-access requirements for data and literature. Natural-language processing (NLP) and machine-learning (ML) tools that can mine data and find patterns therein are becoming mainstream. Exascale HPC capabilities that can aid data mining and pattern recognition and also generate their own data from calculations are now within our grasp. These timely advances present an ideal opportunity to develop data-driven materials-discovery strategies to systematically design and predict new chemicals for a given device application.
This Account shows how data science can afford materials discovery via a four-step ""design-to-device"" pipeline that entails (1) data extraction, (2) data enrichment, (3) material prediction, and (4) experimental validation. Massive databases of cognate chemical and property information are first forged from ""chemistry-aware"" natural-language-processing tools, such as ChemDataExtractor, and enriched using machine-learning methods and high-throughput quantum-chemical calculations. New materials for a bespoke application can then be predicted by mining these databases with algorithmic encodings of relationships between chemical structures and physical properties that are known to deliver functional materials. These may take the form of classification, enumeration, or machine-learning algorithms. A data-mining workflow short-lists these predictions to a handful of lead candidate materials that go forward to experimental validation. This design-to-device approach is being developed to offer a roadmap for the accelerated discovery of new chemicals for functional applications.

This study aimed to utilize the impaired gait patterns preceding FoG to build a machine-learning-based model for FoG prediction. Acceleration signals were collected using an accelerometer attached to the lower back of 12 PD patients with FoG while they were performing designed FoG-provoking walking tasks. Step-based impaired gait features and conventional FoG detection features were extracted from the signals, based on which two FoG prediction models were built using AdaBoost to validate if the use of the impaired gait features can better predict FoG. For the correct labeling of the gait prior to FoG (pre-FoG), the personalized pre-FoG phase was defined according to the slope of the impaired gait pattern. The impaired gait features were relabeled based on the pre-FoG phase upon which the personalized labeled FoG prediction model was built. This was compared with the model built using unified labeling. Results showed that impaired gait features could better predict FoG than conventional FoG detection features with low time latency, and personalized labeling could further improve the FoG prediction accuracy. Using impaired gait features and personalized labeling, we built a FoG prediction model with 0.93 sec of latency. Compared to using conventional features and unified labeling, our model achieved 5.7% higher accuracy (82.7%) in patient-dependent test and 9.8% higher accuracy (77.9%) in patient-independent test. Therefore, using the impaired gait patterns is a promising approach to accurately predict FoG with low latency.","Feature extraction,Legged locomotion,Accelerometers,Predictive models,Labeling,Acceleration,Task analysis,Accelerometer,freezing of gait prediction,gait impairment,machine learning,Parkinson's disease",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Rehabilitation",,4.735,"ACCELERATION,PATTERNS,CLASSIFICATION,DISORDERS,EPISODES,WALKING,PELVIS,ONSET,HEAD",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,,

This work presents a Graphics User Interface that applies two automated learning models based on machine-procured independent variables to assist ophthalmology professionals in keratoconus disease diagnosis and classification.
Abstract This work pursues two objectives: defining a new concept of risk probability associated with suffering early-stage keratoconus, classifying disease severity according to the RETICS (Thematic Network for Co-Operative Research in Health) scale. It recruited 169 individuals, 62 healthy and 107 keratoconus diseased, grouped according to the RETICS classification: 44 grade I; 18 grade II; 15 grade III; 15 grade IV; 15 grade V. Different demographic, optical, pachymetric and eometrical parameters were measured. The collected data were used for training two machine-learning models: a multivariate logistic regression model for early keratoconus detection and an ordinal logistic regression model for RETICS grade assessments. The early keratoconus detection model showed very good sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve, with around 95% for training and 85% for validation. The variables that made the most significant contributions were gender, coma-like, central thickness, high-order aberrations and temporal thickness. The RETICS grade assessment also showed high-performance figures, albeit lower, with a global accuracy of 0.698 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.623-0.766. The most significant variables were CDVA, central thickness and temporal thickness. The developed web application allows the fast, objective and quantitative assessment of keratoconus in early diagnosis and RETICS grading terms.","Scheimpflug,3D cornea model,early keratoconus,Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA)",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"SUBCLINICAL,KERATOCONUS,DETECTION,RISK-ASSESSMENT,SCORING,SYSTEM,FELLOW,EYES,CORNEAL,SCHEIMPFLUG,ECTASIA,TOMOGRAPHY,DIAGNOSIS,LASIK",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/5/1874/pdf,

It is non-radiative, non-invasive, harmless, simple, and low cost screening. The American College of Radiology (ACR) proposed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) to evaluate far more breast lesion severities compared to traditional diagnoses according to five-criterion categories of masses composition described as follows: shape, orientation, margin, echo pattern, and posterior features. However, there exist some problems, such as intensity differences and different resolutions in image acquisition among different types of ultrasound imaging modalities so that clinicians cannot always identify accurately the BI-RADS categories or disease severities. To this end, this article adopted three different brands of ultrasound scanners to fetch breast images for our experimental samples. The breast lesion was detected on the original image using preprocessing, image segmentation, etc. The breast tumor's severity was evaluated on the features of the breast lesion via our proposed classifiers according to the BI-RADS standard rather than traditional assessment on the severity; i.e., merely using benign or malignant. In this work, we mainly focused on the BI-RADS categories 2-5 after the stage of segmentation as a result of the clinical practice. Moreover, several features related to lesion severities based on the selected BI-RADS categories were introduced into three machine learning classifiers, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) combined with feature selection to develop a multi-class assessment of breast tumor severity based on BI-RADS. Experimental results show that the proposed CAD system based on BI-RADS can obtain the identification accuracies with SVM, RF, and CNN reaching 80.00%, 77.78%, and 85.42%, respectively. We also validated the performance and adaptability of the classification using different ultrasound scanners. Results also indicate that the evaluations of F-score based on CNN can obtain measures higher than 75% (i.e., prominent adaptability) when samples were tested on various BI-RADS categories.","Breast Ultrasound Images,CAD system,BI-RADS,SVM,RF,CNN",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"FEATURES,MACHINE",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/5/1830/pdf,

The use of data fusion techniques by CAD systems has proven to be useful, they allow for the merging of information relating to the brain and its tissues from MRI, with that of other types of modalities. This multimodal fusion refines the quality of brain images by reducing redundancy and randomness, which contributes to improving the clinical reliability of the diagnosis compared to the use of a single modality. The purpose of this article is first to determine the main steps of the CAD system for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then to bring together some research work related to the diagnosis of brain disorders, emphasizing AD. Thus the most used methods in the stages of classification and brain regions segmentation are described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, on the basis of the raised problem, we propose a solution within the framework of multimodal fusion. In this context, based on quantitative measurement parameters, a performance study of multimodal CAD systems is proposed by comparing their effectiveness with those exploiting a single MRI modality.

Abstract Skull stripping in brain magnetic resonance volume has recently been attracting attention due to an increased demand to develop an efficient, accurate, and general algorithm for diverse datasets of the brain. Accurate skull stripping is a critical step for neuroimaging diagnostic systems because neither the inclusion of non-brain tissues nor removal of brain parts can be corrected in subsequent steps, which results in unfixed error through subsequent analysis. The objective of this review article is to give a comprehensive overview of skull stripping approaches, including recent deep learning-based approaches. In this paper, the current methods of skull stripping have been divided into two distinct groups-conventional or classical approaches, and convolutional neural networks or deep learning approaches.

To evaluate the mechanical properties of the created coal-grout composite, its unconfined compressive strength (UCS) needed to be tested. A mathematical model is required to elucidate the unknown nonlinear relationship between the UCS and the influencing variables. In this study, six computational intelligence techniques using machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop the mathematical models, which includes back-propagation neural network (BPNN), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression (LR). In addition, the hyper-parameters in these typical algorithms (e.g., the hidden layers in BPNN, the gamma in SVM, and the number of neighbor samples in KNN) were tuned by the recently developed beetle antennae search algorithm (BAS). To prepare the dataset for these ML models, three types of cementitious grout and three types of chemical grout were mixed with coal powders extracted from the Guobei coalmine, Anhui Province, China to create coal-grout composites. In total, 405 coal-grout specimens in total were extracted and tested. Several variables such as grout types, coal-grout ratio, and curing time were chosen as input parameters, while UCS was the output of these models. The results show that coal-chemical grout composites had higher strength in the short-term, while the coal-cementitious grout composites could achieve stable and high strength in the long term.

This method based on deep learning may be useful in the computer-aided detection of multiple lesions on chest X-ray images.
Abstract Automated detection of lung lesions on Chest X-ray images shows good performance to reduce lung cancer mortality. However, it is difficult to detect multiple lesions of single image well and truly, and additional efforts are needed to improve diagnostic efficiency and quality. In this paper, a multi-label classification model combining attention-based neural networks and association-specific contexts is proposed for the detection of multiple lesions on chest X-ray images. A convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network are first aligned by an attention mechanism to take advantage of both image and text information for the detection, called CNN-ATTENTION-LSTM (CAL) network. In addition, a mining method of implicit association strength to obtain an association network of chest lesions (CLA) network is designed to guide the training of CAL network. The CLA network provides possible clinical relationships between lesions to help the CAL network obtain better predictions. Experimental results on ChestX-ray14 dataset show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art models under the metrics of area under curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F-score and achieves up to 85.4% in the case of atelectasis and infiltration.

The joint learning of multi-modal data can utilize intrinsic association, and thus can boost learning performance. Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by viewing feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore the structural information inherent across the modalities, which may play an important role in extracting discriminative features. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Specifically, the $l_{2,1}$-norm (i.e., group-sparsity) regularizer is enforced to jointly select a few common features across different modalities. A novelly designed manifold regularizer is further imposed as a crucial underpinning to preserve the structural information both within and between modalities. Such designed regularizers will make our model more adaptive to realistic neuroimaging data, which are usually of small sample size but high dimensional features. Results: Our model is validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset, where our modalities are regarded as two types of functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under two paradigms. We conduct experimental studies on fMRI-based FC network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction. The results show that our proposed model can not only achieve improved prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

Methods: Human stomach and abdominal models are extracted from computed tomography scans. Normal and abnormal slow waves are simulated along stomach surfaces. Current dipoles at the stomachs surface are propagated to virtual electrodes on the abdomen with a forward model. We establish a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to classify normal and abnormal slow waves from the multi-electrode waveforms. We investigate the effects of non-idealized measurements on performance, including shifted electrode array positioning, smaller array sizes, high body mass index (BMI), and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We compare the performance of our deep CNN to a linear discriminant classifier using wave propagation spatial features. Results: A deep CNN framework demonstrated robust classification, with accuracy above 90% for all SNR above 0 dB, horizontal shifts within 3 cm, vertical shifts within 6 cm, and abdominal tissue depth within 6 cm. The linear discriminant classifier was much more vulnerable to SNR, electrode placement, and BMI.

Similar to other real-time measurement modalities, especially in healthcare, the identification of high-quality signals is essential for clinical interpretation. Our goal is to identify poor quality beats and remove them prior to further analysis of the TCD signal. Methods: We selected objective features for this purpose including Euclidean distance between individual and average beat waveforms, cross-correlation between individual and average beat waveforms, ratio of the high-frequency power to the total beat power, beat length, and variance of the diastolic portion of the beat waveform. We developed an iterative outlier detection algorithm to identify and remove the beats that are different from others in a recording. Finally, we tested the algorithm on a dataset consisting of more than 15 h of TCD data recorded from 48 stroke and 34 in-hospital control subjects. Results: We assessed the performance of the algorithm in the improvement of estimation of clinically important TCD parameters by comparing them to that of manual beat annotation. The results show that there is a strong correlation between the two, that demonstrates the algorithm has successfully recovered the clinically important features. We obtained significant improvement in estimating the TCD parameters using the algorithm accepted beats compared to using all beats. Significance: Our algorithm provides a valuable tool to clinicians for automated detection of the reliable portion of the data. Moreover, it can be used as a pre-processing tool to improve the data quality for automated diagnosis of pathologic beat waveforms using machine learning.","Signal processing algorithms,Euclidean distance,Arteries,Iterative algorithms,Correlation,Morphology,Biomedical signal processing,ultrasonography,signal processing algorithms,change detection algorihms,heuristic algorithms,algorithm design and analysis",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,PRESSURE,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/02/19/554568.full.pdf,

However, if participants only engage with the material from the perspective of having one role, they will ignore comprehensive information on said issue. Therefore, the roles students play during multirole situational learning lead to diversity biases in learning results. To help participants enhance their competencies related to issues and eliminate learning gaps, we developed an issue-based board game named Water Ark based on the following four design ideas: multirole simulation, reflective goal, systemic situation, and interactions of society. The results indicated that after playing the game, participants' knowledge and responsibility regarding water resource adaptation improved significantly. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the gap between the learning outcomes of participants with different roles in the game was not statistically significant, except in terms of students' personal willingness to act. Thus, these design ideas could improve the utility of board games for learning about socio-scientific issues with multirole scenarios.","socio-scientific issue,issue-situation-based board game,multirole situational learning,reflective goal",Article; Proceedings Paper,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,3.473,"SOCIOSCIENTIFIC,ISSUES,ROLE-PLAY,WATER,EDUCATION,SIMULATIONS",SUSTAINABILITY,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/2139/pdf,

E-static considerably varies with the change in the lithology. Therefore, a robust model for E-static prediction is needed. In this study, the predictability of E-static for sandstone formation using four machine learning models was evaluated. The design parameters of the machine learning models were optimized to improve their predictability. The machine learning models were trained to estimate E-static based on bulk formation density, compressional transit time, and shear transit time. The machine learning models were trained and tested using 592 well log data points and their corresponding core-derived E-static values collected from one sandstone formation in well-A and then validated on 38 data points collected from a sandstone formation in well-B. Among the machine learning models developed in this work, Mamdani fuzzy interference system was the highly accurate model to predict E-static for the validation data with an average absolute percentage error of only 1.56% and R of 0.999. The developed static Young's modulus prediction models could help the new generation to characterize the formation rock with less cost and safe operation.","static Young's modulus,sandstone formations,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,3.473,"PREDICTION,MODEL",SUSTAINABILITY,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/1880/pdf,

In many cases, a woman who has reported her partner to police for gender-based violence needs to ensure her protection (either before the trial of the aggressor or after their freedom). Thus, it would be ideal if autonomous alarm systems could be developed in order to call the police if necessary. Up to now, many proposals have been presented in this regard, including solutions based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) but, unfortunately, these approaches usually rely on the active participation of the victims (survivors), who have to turn the system on by themselves if needed. Therefore, in order to overcome such limitations, in this work, a passive continuous monitoring system is proposed which uses biosensors attached to the survivor as well as machine learning techniques to infer if an abnormal situation related to gender-based violence is taking place, activating in this case an alarm. The monitoring structure of the system supervises a great deal of bio-signals according to the current status of technology of wearables and biomedical devices. The presented biosensors-based surveillance solution can also be manually disconnected for 30/60/90 min (on demand) in order to avoid false positives when a woman is, for example, practicing sports or carrying out other inoffensive activities that could incorrectly activate the alarm.","intimate partner violence,information and communication technologies,wearable sensors,internet of things,machine learning",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,2.612,"RECOGNITION,DEVICES,STRESS",SYMMETRY-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/3/460/pdf,

Many Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools have been developed to facilitate IS, but they predominantly focus on the as-is analysis of the IS system, and do not consider the development of a common desired target vision or corresponding possible future scenarios as well as conceivable transformation paths from the actual to the defined (sustainability) target state.

Through range analysis, BP (Back Propagation) neural network factor significance analysis and mapping the relationship between physical properties and factors according to the importance of each factor, the effect of densification variables on the physical characteristics of biomass pellets was studied, and the outcome of adding brown sugar water binder to raw material by spraying method in improving the densification quality of biomass was explored. Results showed the brown sugar water binder added to pine sawdust by spraying method could mix the binder and biomass raw material more evenly compared with the stirring method. The relaxation ratio of pellets obtained by spraying method was reduced by 13.47%.

However, there are different challenges when machining titanium alloys because of the high heat generated during cutting processes which adversely affects the product quality and process performance in general. Thus, optimization of the machining conditions while machining such alloys is necessary. In this work, an experimental investigation into the influence of different cutting parameters (i.e., depth of cut, cutting length, feed rate, and cutting speed) on surface roughness (Rz), flank wear (VB), power consumption as well as the material removal rate (MRR) during high-speed turning of Ti-6Al-4V alloy is presented and discussed. In addition, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) along with the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-fuzzy integrated approach was employed to model and optimize the overall cutting performance. It should be stated that the predicted values for all machining outputs demonstrated excellent agreement with the experimental values at the selected optimal solution.

In this paper, a new prediction model for compressive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC) was developed using a non-tuned machine learning technique, namely, a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). The RELM prediction model was developed using a comprehensive dataset obtained from previously published studies. The input variables of the model include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age of specimens. k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the prediction reliability of the developed RELM model. The prediction results of the RELM model were evaluated using various error measures and compared with that of the standard extreme learning machine (ELM) and other methods presented in the literature.

Nevertheless, the design of FC requires a large number of experiments to determine the appropriate Compressive Strength (CS). Employment of machine learning algorithms to take advantage of the existing experiments database has been attempted, but model performance can still be improved. In this study, the performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was fully analyzed to predict the 28 days CS of FC. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were used to statistically analyze the convergence of the modeled results under the effect of random sampling strategies and the network structures selected. Various statistical measures such as Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used for validation of model performance. The results show that ANN is a highly efficient predictor of the CS of FC, achieving a maximum R-2 value of 0.976 on the training part and an R-2 of 0.972 on the testing part, using the optimized C-ANN-[3-4-5-1] structure, which compares with previous published studies. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) over 1000 MCS was also performed to interpret the relationship between the input parameters and 28 days CS of FC. Dry density was found as the variable with the highest impact to predict the CS of FC. The results presented could facilitate and enhance the use of C-ANN in other civil engineering-related problems.","Compressive Strength,Foamed Concrete,Artificial Neural Network,Monte Carlo simulations",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"NEURAL-NETWORK,SUSCEPTIBILITY,ASSESSMENT,THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY,RESISTANCE,AGGREGATE,ENERGY,MODEL",MATERIALS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7084645?pdf=render,
