Many applications of deep learning in the field of medical image analysis face the problem of insufficient annotated data. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning method for chronic gastritis classification using gastric X-ray images. The proposed semi-supervised learning method based on tri-training can leverage unannotated data to boost the performance that is achieved with a small amount of annotated data. We utilize a novel learning method named Between-Class learning (BC learning) that can considerably enhance the performance of our semi-supervised learning method. As a result, our method can effectively learn from unannotated data and achieve high diagnostic accuracy for chronic gastritis.","Chronic gastritis,Computer-aided diagnosis,Medical image analysis,Convolutional neural network,Semi-supervised learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,2.61,,MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/81642/1/manuscript-1.pdf,

The different types of WBC abnormalities are related to different diseases so that the total number and classification of WBCs are critical for clinical diagnosis and therapy. However, the traditional method of white blood cell classification is to segment the cells, extract features, and then classify them. Such method depends on the good segmentation, and the accuracy is not high. Moreover, the insufficient data or unbalanced samples can cause the low classification accuracy of model by using deep learning in medical diagnosis. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new blood cell image classification framework which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) and a residual neural network (ResNet).

Laboratory results that are overlooked or incorrectly interpreted lead to adverse events and endanger patient safety. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) may facilitate appropriate interpretation of results and subsequent medical response.

Materials and methods A literature review of CDSSs describes the current state of research. The research project AMPEL is presented with its objectives, challenges, and first results. Furthermore, the development of a framework and reporting system is illustrated through the clinical example of severe hypokalemia. Results and conclusion Through interdisciplinary development and constant optimization, a specific CDSS with high acceptance among clinicians was developed. Initial results in the case of severe hypokalemia show a positive effect on patient care. Thereby, more complex frameworks such as sepsis diagnostics or acute coronary syndrome are implemented. The limited availability of standardized and digital clinical data is challenging. In addition to the application of classic decision trees in CDSS, the use of machine learning offers a promising perspective for future developments.","Clinical decision support,Reporting systems,Machine learning,Severe hypokalemia,Medical errors",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",General & Internal Medicine,,0.557,"INFORMATION,MANAGEMENT,RESOURCES,DIAGNOSIS",INTERNIST,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00108-020-00775-3.pdf,

Benign skin lesion types are not deadly; however, malignant types of skin lesions can be fatal. Lethal forms are known as skin cancer. These types require urgent clinical treatment. Fast detection and diagnosis of malignant types of skin lesions might prevent life-threatening scenarios. This work presents two methods for the automatic classification of malignant melanoma and seborrhoeic keratosis lesions. The first method builds on modelling skin images together with wavelet coefficients. Approximate, horizontal, and vertical wavelet coefficients are obtained using the wavelet transform, and then deep learning (DL) models are generated for each of the representations and skin images. The second method builds on modelling skin images together with three approximate coefficients. This method utilises a sequential wavelet transformation to produce approximation coefficients. Then DL models are generated for each of the representations and skin images. Transfer learning-based ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 DL models provide model images and wavelet coefficients. Then skin lesion detection is achieved by fusing model output probabilities.

Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (rho = 0.87 for ROP and rho = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging.","PLUS DISEASE,RETINOPATHY,CLASSIFICATION,PREMATURITY,DIAGNOSIS",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,,"PLUS,DISEASE,RETINOPATHY,CLASSIFICATION,PREMATURITY,DIAGNOSIS",NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/43200/7/s41746-020-0255-1.pdf,

For achieving optimal extrinsic properties, their microstructure needs to be controlled in a multi-parameter space, which usually requires too high a number of experiments to map. Here, we propose to master thin film processing microstructure complexity, and to reduce the cost of microstructure design by joining combinatorial experimentation with generative deep learning models to extract synthesis-composition-microstructure relations. A generative machine learning approach using a conditional generative adversarial network predicts structure zone diagrams. We demonstrate that generative models provide a so far unseen level of quality of generated structure zone diagrams that can be applied for the optimization of chemical composition and processing parameters to achieve a desired microstructure. Controlling the microstructure of thin films is vital for tuning their properties. Here, machine learning is applied to obtain synthesis-composition-microstructure relationships in the form of structure zone diagrams for thin films, enabling microstructure prediction.","PHYSICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION,MICROSTRUCTURE,COATINGS,GROWTH,METAL,MODEL,AL,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,TIN(001)",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,,"PHYSICAL,VAPOR-DEPOSITION,MICROSTRUCTURE,COATINGS,GROWTH,METAL,MODEL,AL,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,TIN%28001%29",COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-020-0017-2.pdf,

Multi-factor experiments, involving temperature, relative humidity, and dust concentration, were carried out for error analysis and correction based on 64 orthogonal tests. The BP neural network model was built and used for predicting detection errors. The results show that with the increase of relative humidity, the average error ratio of point cloud shows an S-shape curve increase, and the growth rate obviously accelerates as the relative humidity is between 75.0% and 85.0%. Furthermore, the error ratio also increases linearly with the increase of dust concentration. The growth rate is the largest when a dust concentration is between 40 mg/m~3 and 100 mg/m~3, the lowest rate occurs when the dust concentration is less than 40 mg/m~3 and the modest rate occurs with the dust concentration greater than 100 mg/m~3. However, the temperature has little effect on the average error ratio of point cloud. The average relative error is 1.80% and correction coefficient is 0.993.

12,Identifying Antifreeze Proteins Based on Key Evolutionary Information,8,,,"Sun Shanwen,Ding Hui,Wang Donghua,Han Shuguang","Sun SW,Ding H,Wang DH,Han SG",Han SG,10.3389/fbioe.2020.00244,University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Antifreeze proteins are important antifreeze materials that have been widely used in industry, including in cryopreservation, de-icing, and food storage applications. However, the quantity of some commercially produced antifreeze proteins is insufficient for large-scale industrial applications. Further, many antifreeze proteins have properties such as cytotoxicity, severely hindering their applications. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protein-ice interactions and identifying novel antifreeze proteins are, therefore, urgently needed. In this study, to uncover the mechanisms underlying protein-ice interactions and provide an efficient and accurate tool for identifying antifreeze proteins, we assessed various evolutionary features based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and evaluated their importance for discriminating of antifreeze and non-antifreeze proteins. We then parsimoniously selected seven key features with the highest importance. We found that the selected features showed opposite tendencies (regarding the conservation of certain amino acids) between antifreeze and non-antifreeze proteins. Five out of the seven features had relatively high contributions to the discrimination of antifreeze and non-antifreeze proteins, as revealed by a principal component analysis, i.e., the conservation of the replacement of Cys, Trp, and Gly in antifreeze proteins by Ala, Met, and Ala, respectively, in the related proteins, and the conservation of the replacement of Arg in non-antifreeze proteins by Ser and Arg in the related proteins. Based on the seven parsimoniously selected key features, we established a classifier using support vector machine, which outperformed the state-of-the-art tools. These results suggest that understanding evolutionary information is crucial to designing accurate automated methods for discriminating antifreeze and non-antifreeze proteins. Our classifier, therefore, is an efficient tool for annotating new proteins with antifreeze functions based on sequence information and can facilitate their application in industry.","antifreeze proteins,support vector machine,evolution,machine learning,position-specific scoring matrix",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,5.973,"EXTRACTION,MACHINE,LARVAE",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00244/pdf,

Radiologic screening of high-risk adults reduces lung-cancer-related mortality(1,2); however, a small minority of eligible individuals undergo such screening in the United States(3,4). The availability of blood-based tests could increase screening uptake. Here we introduce improvements to cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq)(5), a method for the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), to better facilitate screening applications. We show that, although levels are very low in early-stage lung cancers, ctDNA is present prior to treatment in most patients and its presence is strongly prognostic. We also find that the majority of somatic mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with lung cancer and of risk-matched controls reflect clonal haematopoiesis and are non-recurrent. Compared with tumour-derived mutations, clonal haematopoiesis mutations occur on longer cfDNA fragments and lack mutational signatures that are associated with tobacco smoking. Integrating these findings with other molecular features, we develop and prospectively validate a machine-learning method termed 'lung cancer likelihood in plasma' (Lung-CLiP), which can robustly discriminate early-stage lung cancer patients from risk-matched controls. This approach achieves performance similar to that of tumour-informed ctDNA detection and enables tuning of assay specificity in order to facilitate distinct clinical applications. Our findings establish the potential of cfDNA for lung cancer screening and highlight the importance of risk-matching cases and controls in cfDNA-based screening studies.","DNA,PLASMA,NUMBER",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,54.637,"DNA,PLASMA,NUMBER",NATURE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230734,

It is the major cause of serious injuries, disabilities, hospitalizations and even death especially for elderly people living alone. Timely detection could provide immediate medical service to the injured and avoid its harmful consequences. Great number of vision-based techniques has been proposed by installing cameras in several everyday environments. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized these techniques, mostly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose weighted multi-stream deep convolutional neural networks that exploit the rich multimodal data provided by RGB-D cameras. Our method detects automatically fall events and sends a help request to the caregivers. Our contribution is three-fold. We build a new architecture composed of four separate CNN streams, one for each modality. The first modality is based on a single combined RGB and depth image to encode static appearance information. RGB image is used to capture color and texture and depth image deals with illumination variations. In contrast of the first feature that lacks the contextual information about previous and next frames, the second modality characterizes the human shape variations. After background subtraction and person recognition, human silhouette is extracted and stacked to define history of binary motion HBMI. The last two modalities are used to more discriminate the motion information. Stacked amplitude and oriented flow are used in addition to stacked optical flow field to describe respectively the velocity, the direction and the motion displacements. The main motivation behind the use of these multimodal data is to combine complementary information such as motion, shape, RGB and depth appearance to achieve more accurate detection than using only one modality. Our second contribution is the combination of the four streams to generate the final decision for fall detection. We evaluate early and late fusion strategies and we have defined the weight of each modality based on its overall system performance. Weighted score fusion is finally adopted based on our experiments. In the third contribution, transfer learning and data augmentation are applied to increase the amount of training data, avoid over fitting and improve the accuracy.

Accurate assessment of cardiac function is crucial for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease(1), screening for cardiotoxicity(2) and decisions regarding the clinical management of patients with a critical illness(3). However, human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has considerable inter-observer variability despite years of training(4,5). Here, to overcome this challenge, we present a video-based deep learning algorithm-EchoNet-Dynamic-that surpasses the performance of human experts in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 4.1% and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (area under the curve of 0.97). In an external dataset from another healthcare system, EchoNet-Dynamic predicts the ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 6.0% and classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an area under the curve of 0.96. Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that the model has variance that is comparable to or less than that of human experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can rapidly identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in real time. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly available a large dataset of 10,030 annotated echocardiogram videos.","VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION,HEART-FAILURE,ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY,RISK,EPIDEMIOLOGY,ASSOCIATION,MANAGEMENT,CANCER",Article,"NATURE PORTFOLIO, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,54.637,"VENTRICULAR,EJECTION,FRACTION,HEART-FAILURE,ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY,RISK,EPIDEMIOLOGY,ASSOCIATION,MANAGEMENT,CANCER",NATURE,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2019/11/27/19012419.full.pdf,

A unique ordering effect has been observed in functional catalytic nanoscale materials. Instead of randomly arranged binding to the catalyst surface, metal nanoparticles show spatially ordered behavior resulting in formation of geometrical patterns. Understanding of such nanoscale materials and analysis of corresponding microscopy images will never be comprehensive without appropriate reference datasets. Here we describe the first dataset of electron microscopy images comprising individual nanoparticles which undergo ordering on a surface towards the formation of geometrical patterns.

The mortality rate due to cervical cancer is approximately 90% in low or middle income countries due to lack of suitable pre-screening procedures and experienced medical staff. Colposcopy images or cervigrams, are the images that capture the cervical region, are considered as the gold standard by the medical experts for the identification and evaluation of cervical cancer. The visual assessment of cervigrams for recognizing cancer suffers from high inter- or intra-variations especially among less or unskilled medical experts. However, this method is dependent on colposcopists' observation and it is more time consuming, tedious and laborious task which calls for development of computer-aided method for diagnosis of cervical cancer. With the technological advancements, deep learning has been commonly employed for providing automated solutions for disease diagnosis due to its self-learning capability. This paper presents a deep-learning-based method for cervix cancer classification using colposcopy images. The architecture of the proposed method namely, ColpoNet, has been motivated by the DenseNet model because it is computationally more efficient as compared to other models.

These attractive features hold great potential for construction of energy-efficient artificial neural networks. However, the memristors made from pristine 2D materials typically exhibit a small dynamic range and poor linearity of switching characteristics. The neural network simulated in the basis of such switching characteristics has a poor learning accuracy of similar to 43%. In this work, we find that Ar plasma treatment can greatly improve both the dynamic range and linearity of analogue switching characteristics of few-layer MoS2 memristors. The neural network consisting of such plasma-treated memristors is simulated to be able to result in a significantly improved learning accuracy of 94.3% for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Our additional Auger electron analysis in combination with electronic characterizations indicates that Ar plasma enhances the concentration of movable S vacancies in MoS2 channels, which leads to improvements in the analogue switching properties. Especially, the average dynamic range of MoS2 memristors are increased from 1.8 to 14.8 after plasma treatment. This work provides scientific insights for controlling the switching characteristics of 2D memristors and provides technical instruction for construction of practical neural networks based on 2D materials.","memristors,MoS2,nanoelectronics,2D materials,defects,MNIST,neural network",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Physics,,3.041,"TRANSISTORS,TRANSITION,EFFICIENT,BEHAVIOR,SYNAPSE,DEVICE",JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS,,

However, its high computational cost still prevents it from being used in high-throughput screening methodologies, where a cheaper estimate of the elastic properties of a material is required. In this work, we have investigated the accuracy of force field calculations for the prediction of mechanical properties and, in particular, for the characterization of the directional Poisson's ratio. We analyze the behavior of about 600 000 hypothetical zeolitic structures at the classical level (a scale 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous studies), to highlight generic trends between mechanical properties and energetic stability. By comparing these results with DFT calculations on 991 zeolitic frameworks, we highlight the limitations of force field predictions, in particular for predicting auxeticity. We then used this reference DFT data as a training set for a machine learning algorithm, showing that it offers a way to build fast and reliable predictive models for anisotropic properties. The accuracies obtained are, in particular, much better than the current ""cheap"" approach for screening, which is the use of force fields. These results are a significant improvement over the previous work, due to the more difficult nature of the properties studied, namely, the anisotropic elastic response.

Compositional engineering, such as mixing of two different halogen anions, has been explored as one strategy to enhance thermodynamic stabilities, with an extra benefit of band gap tuning. However, a thorough examination on how anion engineering affects the structural dynamics, which governs many physical behaviors of mixed halide perovskites, remains elusive. Here, by combining density functional theory calculations with statistical learning, we explore the critical correlation between composition-dependent structural and electronic dynamics of cubic CsPb(I1-xBrx)(3) across 24 different compositions, which encompasses multiple degrees of freedom (composition, time, and atomistic and electronic structures). We show that the anharmonic vibrations of halogen atoms are stronger (weaker) in I (Br)-rich phases. The dynamics of Pb-halogen octahedral coordination environments, as revealed from the machine-learned coordinates, follows largely the opposite composition-dependent trend of the vibrational anharmonicity of halogen atoms. Nevertheless, for all mixed halide perovskites, a much faster decoherence in electronic band gap at 300 K is observed, signifying a stronger electron-phonon coupling in these systems.

Ecological resource research is entering a new era driven by big data. Traditional statistical learning and machine learning algorithms have problems with saturation in dealing with big data.

The strategy leans on the transfer learning process that is implemented to perform learned-features extraction using six different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on natural images. To test the proposed strategy, the learned features were extracted from the NBI-InfFrames dataset. Support vector machines (SVMs) and CNN-based approach were then used to classify frames as informative (I) and uninformative ones such as blurred (B), with saliva or specular reflections (S), and underexposed (U). The best-performing learned-feature set was achieved with VGG 16 resulting in a recall of I of 0.97 when classifying frames with SVMs and 0.98 with the CNN-based classification.

However, the intricate pore structure complicates the prediction of permeability. Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach for predicting inherent correlations in large data sets. In this paper, a hybrid ML method is proposed to implicitly build a nonlinear relationship between pore structure parameters and permeability. For the dataset preparation, an improved quartet structure generation set algorithm was firstly developed to generate 1000 porous media. Then, the pore structure parameters were extracted as input parameters and the permeability was calculated as the output parameter. For the ML modelling, a hybrid ML method was proposed using a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The ANN was employed to learn the nonlinear relationships and GA was used to tune ANN architecture for the best performance. The prediction results show that the GA-ANN was robust in predicting permeability based on pore structure parameters. The ANN model with the optimum architecture could achieve an average R value of 0.998 on the training set and 0.999 on the testing set. Practically, the porous sample can be obtained through micro-computed tomography (CT) or nano-CT, and the proposed framework can be applied to real porous media.

To improve the efficiency, accuracy and adaptivity of the parameter inversion analysis method of a rockfill dam, this study aims to establish an adaptive model based on a harmony search algorithm (HS) and a mixed multi-output relevance vector machine (MMRVM).
Design/methodology/approach
By introducing the mixed kernel function, the MMRVM can accurately simulate the nonlinear relationship between the material parameters and dam settlement. Therefore, the finite element method with time consumption can be replaced by the MMRVM. Because of its excellent global search capability, the HS is used to optimize the kernel parameters of the MMRVM and the material parameters of a rockfill dam.
Findings
Because the parameters of the HS and the variation range of the MMRVM parameters are relatively fixed, the HS-MMRVM can imbue the inversion analysis with adaptivity; the number of observation points required and the robustness of the HS-MMRVM are analyzed. An application example involving a concrete-faced rockfill dam shows that the HS-MMRVM exhibits high accuracy and high speed in the parameter inversion analysis of static and creep constitutive models.
Originality/value
An adaptive inversion analysis model is established to avoid the parameters of traditional methods that need to be set by humans, which strongly affect the inversion analysis results. By introducing the mixed kernel function, the MMRVM can accurately simulate the nonlinear relationship between the material parameters and dam settlement. To reduce the data dimensions and verify the model's robustness, the number of observation points required for inversion analysis and the acceptable degree of noise are determined. The confidence interval is built to monitor dam settlement and provide the foundation for dam monitoring and reservoir operation management.","Rockfill dam,Parameter inversion analysis,Adaptivity,Mixed multi-output relevance vector machine,Harmony search",Article,"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD, HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematics,Mechanics",,1.442,"RESPONSE-SURFACE,BACK-ANALYSIS,OPTIMIZATION",ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS,,

Moreover, this study chooses EEG instrument to explore the relationship between trust and purchase intention in chatbots condition. We collect 204 questionnaires and invite 30 respondents to participate the survey. The results indicated that credibility, competence, anthropomorphism, social presence, and informativness have influence on consumer's trust in chatbots, in turn, have effect on purchase intention. Moreover, the findings show that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus are significantly associated with building a trust relationship by inferring chatbots to influence subsequent behaviour.","Trust,chatbots,neuroscience,electroencephalography (EEG),purchase intention",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Engineering",,3.156,"PRODUCT,RECOMMENDATION,AGENTS,SOCIAL,NETWORKING,SITES,CONVERSATIONAL,AGENT,E-COMMERCE,MEDIA,NEUROSCIENCE,MODEL,GRATIFICATIONS,CREDIBILITY,PERSPECTIVE",BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,,

Graphene-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely explored; however, either experiments or density functional theory (DFT) computations cannot screen catalysts at high speed. Herein, based on DFT computations of 104 graphene-supported SACs (M@C-3, M@C-4, M@pyridine-N-4, and M@pyrrole-N-4), we built machine learning (ML) models to describe the underlying pattern of easily obtainable physical properties and limiting potentials (mean square errors = 0.027/0.021/0.035 V for the ORR/OER/HER, respectively) and employed these models to predict the catalytic performance of 260 other graphene-supported SACs containing metal-NxCy active sites (M@NxCy). We recomputed the top catalysts recommended by ML towards the ORR/OER/HER by DFT, which confirmed the reliability of our ML model, and identified two OER catalysts (Ir@pyridine-N3C1 and Ir@pyridine-N2C2) outperforming noble metal oxides, RuO2 and IrO2. The ML models quantitatively unveiled the significance of various descriptors and quickly narrowed down the candidate list of graphene-supported single-atom catalysts. This approach can be easily used to screen and design other SACs and significantly accelerate the catalyst design for many other important reactions.","OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION,DOPED POROUS CARBON,RATIONAL DESIGN,CATALYSTS,TRENDS,NANOPARTICLES,ENERGY,SIZE",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Energy & Fuels,Materials Science",,11.995,"OXYGEN,REDUCTION,REACTION,DOPED,POROUS,CARBON,RATIONAL,DESIGN,CATALYSTS,TRENDS,NANOPARTICLES,ENERGY,SIZE",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A,,

In these works, adversarial learning is directly applied to the original supervised segmentation (synthesis) networks. The usage of adversarial learning is effective in improving visual perception performance since adversarial learning works as realistic regularization for supervised generators. However, the quantitative performance often cannot improve as much as the qualitative performance, and it can even become worse in some cases. In this paper, we explore how we can take better advantage of adversarial learning in supervised segmentation (synthesis) models and propose an adversarial confidence learning framework to better model these problems. We analyze the roles of discriminator in the classic GANs and compare them with those in supervised adversarial systems. Based on this analysis, we propose adversarial confidence learning, i.e., besides the adversarial learning for emphasizing visual perception, we use the confidence information provided by the adversarial network to enhance the design of supervised segmentation (synthesis) network. In particular, we propose using a fully convolutional adversarial network for confidence learning to provide voxel-wise and region-wise confidence information for the segmentation (synthesis) network. With these settings, we propose a difficulty-aware attention mechanism to properly handle hard samples or regions by taking structural information into consideration so that we can better deal with the irregular distribution of medical data. Furthermore, we investigate the loss functions of various GANs and propose using the binary cross entropy loss to train the proposed adversarial system so that we can retain the unlimited modeling capacity of the discriminator. Experimental results on clinical and challenge datasets show that our proposed network can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation (synthesis) accuracy. Further analysis also indicates that adversarial confidence learning can both improve the visual perception performance and the quantitative performance.","Adversarial confidence learning,Medical image analysis,Segmentation,Image synthesis",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,13.284,"CT,IMAGE,NETWORK,MRI",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211108,

Early-stage prevention becomes complex due to reasons unknown. However, some typical signatures like masses and micro-calcifications upon investigating mammograms can help diagnose women better. Manual diagnosis is a hard task the radiologists carry out frequently. For their assistance, many computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) approaches have been developed. To improve upon the state of the art, we proposed a deep ensemble transfer learning and neural network classifier for automatic feature extraction and classification. In computer-assisted mammography, deep learning-based architectures are generally not trained on mammogram images directly. Instead, the images are pre-processed beforehand, and then they are adopted to be given as input to the ensemble model proposed. The robust features extracted from the ensemble model are optimized into a feature vector which are further classified using the neural network (nntraintool). The network was trained and tested to separate out benign and malignant tumors, thus achieving an accuracy of 0.88 with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.88. The attained results show that the proposed methodology is a promising and robust CADx system for breast cancer classification.

However, given the complexity of the sintering process and the large number of manipulated variables, it is not practical for operators to identify appropriate set points for the manipulated variables to achieve these conflicting objectives. While significant amount of research is devoted to optimization of the on-strand sintering process, optimization of the integrated sintering process, viz. granulation and on-strand sintering together, has not received much attention. This is, however, necessary as the granulation process dictates the moisture content, mean size and voidage of the green mix bed, which in turn have a very strong influence on the sintering process and sinter quality. In this work, we have formulated and solved a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize both sinter productivity and quality for the integrated iron ore sintering process. Predictive models for productivity and quality parameters such as tumbler index (TI) and reduction degradation index (RDI) are built using machine learning algorithms. The optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Optimal settings for key manipulated variables such as moisture content of green mix, fuel content, bed height and strand speed are obtained for the Pareto solutions. The optimization results are useful for identifying the operational range of the sintering process and can be used by operators for running the sinter plant optimally for a given set of raw materials.","Sintering,Granulation,Multi-objective optimization,Data-based modeling",Article,"SPRINGER INDIA, 7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,,1.349,"GRANULATION,EFFICIENCY,STRENGTH,MODEL",TRANSACTIONS OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF METALS,,

The main photosynthetic parameters were measured with the LI-6400 photosynthesis system, fluorescence measurements were acquired via saturation pulse, and an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and low PH nano-HPLC-MS-MS-based proteomic techniques were used to assess photosynthesis-related proteome changes 14 days after inoculation with F. verticillioides between inoculated and control leaves of YT94-128 (R) and GT37 (S) plants. The net photosynthetic rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration rate (E) of sugarcane plants were significantly reduced as pathogen stress increased, and the intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) was significantly elevated compared to that in the control plants. In addition, 29 proteins involved in photosynthesis were found to be differentially expressed following pathogen inoculation, including six proteins that were differentially expressed in both sugarcane varieties.

The functional EVs hierarchically with blood-derived autohydrogel (AH) are then incorporated to form an osteoinductive biomimetic extracellular matrix (BECM). The alkaline phosphatase-rich EVs are released from the outer layers to induce osteoblast differentiation during early stages. Thereafter, as the degradation of AH occurred, calcium/phosphorus (Ca/P)-rich EVs are liberated to promote the nucleation of extracellular mineral crystals. Additionally, BECM contains considerable collagen fibrils that provide additional nucleation sites for crystallites deposition, thus reaching self-mineralization in situ.

However, despite the great progress achieved by such a broad and diversified scientific inquiry, we are still lacking a comprehensive theory that could explain how numerical concepts are learned by the human brain. In this perspective, I argue that computer simulation should have a primary role in filling this gap because it allows identifying the finer-grained computational mechanisms underlying complex behavior and cognition. Modeling efforts will be most effective if carried out at cross-disciplinary intersections, as attested by the recent success in simulating human cognition using techniques developed in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this respect, deep learning models have provided valuable insights into our most basic quantification abilities, showing how numerosity perception could emerge in multi-layered neural networks that learn the statistical structure of their visual environment. Nevertheless, this modeling approach has not yet scaled to more sophisticated cognitive skills that are foundational to higher-level mathematical thinking, such as those involving the use of symbolic numbers and arithmetic principles. I will discuss promising directions to push deep learning into this uncharted territory. If successful, such endeavor would allow simulating the acquisition of numerical concepts in its full complexity, guiding empirical investigation on the richest soil and possibly offering far-reaching implications for educational practice.","computational modeling,artificial neural networks,deep learning,number sense,symbol grounding,mathematical learning,embodied cognition",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","Neurosciences & Neurology,Psychology",,3.983,"NUMERICAL,COGNITION,NUMBER,SENSE,CHILDREN,EMERGENCE,ABILITIES,LANGUAGE,GESTURE,SYSTEMS,THOUGHT,ACUITY",FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7099599?pdf=render,

Materials and methods Seventy-one ccRCC patients (31 low grade and 40 high grade) were included in this study. Tumors were manually segmented on CT images followed by the application of three image preprocessing techniques (Laplacian of Gaussian, wavelet filter, and discretization of the intensity values) on delineated tumor volumes. Overall, 2530 radiomics features (tumor shape and size, intensity statistics, and texture) were extracted from each segmented tumor volume. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the association between each feature and the histological condition. Multivariate analysis involved the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the following three feature selection algorithms: the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, Student's t test, and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance. These selected features were then used to construct three classification models (SVM, random forest, and logistic regression) to discriminate high from low-grade ccRCC at nephrectomy. Lastly, multivariate model performance was evaluated on the bootstrapped validation cohort using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metric. Results The univariate analysis demonstrated that among the different image sets, 128 bin-discretized images have statistically significant different texture parameters with a mean AUC of 0.74 +/- 3 (q value < 0.05). The three ML-based classifiers showed proficient discrimination between high and low-grade ccRCC. The AUC was 0.78 for logistic regression, 0.62 for random forest, and 0.83 for the SVM model, respectively.

In the current studies, the use of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) allowed for the discovery of multiplexed biological information, specifically uncovering glycogen-like and lipid-like component bases. The corresponding scores of glycogen and previously unidentified lipids revealed the content variations of these two chemicals in the cellular data. The NMF decomposed glycogen and lipid-like bases were able to separate the cancer cell lines into radiosensitive and radioresistant groups. A further lipid phenotype investigation was also attempted by applying non-negative least squares (NNLS) to the lipid-like bases decomposed individually from three cell lines. Qualitative differences found in lipid weights for each lipid-like basis suggest the lipid phenotype differences in the three tested cancer cell lines. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the application of NMF and NNLS on RS data analysis to monitor ionizing radiation-induced cellular responses can yield multiplexed biological information on bio-response to RT not revealed by conventional chemometric approaches.","Raman spectroscopy,RS,radiation therapy,RT,radiation response,non-negative matrix factorization,NMF,data analysis",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","Instruments & Instrumentation,Spectroscopy",,2.296,"MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS,CANCER,METABOLISM,ALGORITHMS,SPECTRA,RADIOSENSITIZATION,GLYCOGEN,CELLS",APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY,,

In this study, structural magnetic resonance images (sMRIs) from SZ patients and NCs were used for discriminative analysis. This study proposed an ML framework based on coarse-to-fine feature selection. The proposed framework used two-sample t-tests to extract the differences between groups first, then further eliminated the nonrelevant and redundant features with recursive feature elimination (RFE), and finally utilized the support vector machine (SVM) to learn the decision models with selected gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) features. Previous studies have tended to report differences at the group level instead of at the individual level and cannot be widely applied. The method proposed in this study extends the diagnosis to the individual level and has a higher recognition rate than previous methods. The experimental results of this study demonstrate that the proposed framework distinguishes SZ patients from NCs, with the highest classification accuracy reaching over 85%. The identified biomarkers are also consistent with previous literature findings.

Recently, active preference learning has been applied in HRI to interactively shape a robot's behavior. We study a framework where users specify constraints on allowable robot movements on a graphical interface, yielding a robot task specification. However, users may not be able to accurately assess the impact of such constraints on the performance of a robot. Thus, we revise the specification by iteratively presenting users with alternative solutions where some constraints might be violated, and learn about the importance of the constraints from the users' choices between these alternatives. We demonstrate our framework in a user study with a material transport task in an industrial facility. We show that nearly all users accept alternative solutions and thus obtain a revised specification through the learning process, and that the revision leads to a substantial improvement in robot performance. Further, the learning process reduces the variances between the specifications from different users and, thus, makes the specifications more similar. As a result, the users whose initial specifications had the largest impact on performance benefit the most from the interactive learning.","Cognitive HRI,motion planning",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Robotics,,6.376,"PERFORMANCE,COMPLEXITY",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10412,

However, the fact that traditional methods of drug discovery are expensive and time-consuming has discouraged the pharmaceutical industry, leaving the burden of discovery to research institutions. This is where quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods become a key tool in fighting multidrug-resistant bacteria, seeing as they provide useful information for the rational design of new active molecules at a minimal cost. A variety of linear and nonlinear statistical methods are used to develop these models based on the 2D or 3D representations of the molecules. QSAR models have proven to be effective in rapidly providing lead compound candidates against resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus,Escherichia coli,Pseudomonasspp.,Bacillus subtilis, orMycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover, QSAR methods allow for a deeper analysis of a library of molecules, selecting those with not only the optimal activity, but also the most favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles. The information obtained from QSAR studies makes optimizing an existing drug simpler, which is a cost-effective approach to obtain new treatments against increasingly resistant bacteria.

Subsequently, an MIC matrix was constructed according to the electrode arrangement rules and represented by an MIC gray image. Finally, a deep learning model designed with two principal component analysis convolutional layers and a nonlinear transformation operation extracted the spatial characteristics and global interchannel synchronization features from the constructed feature images, which were then input to support vector machines to perform the emotion recognition tasks.

This study demonstrates that the applied machine learning strategy allows us to obtain the correlation coefficients, between predicted and reference values of (hyper)polarizabilities, exceeding 0.9 on training, validation, and test set. However, in order to achieve such satisfactory predictive power, one needs to choose the training set appropriately, as the machine learning methods are very sensitive to the linker-type diversity in the training set, yielding catastrophic predictions in certain cases.

This is a particular disorder causing luminal narrowing and stricture formation in the inflamed bowel wall of a patient denoting, possibly, need for surgery. Thus, the development of treatments reducing fibrosis is an urgent issue to be addressed in IBD. In this context, we require the finding and development of biomarkers of intestinal fibrosis. Potential candidates such as microRNAs, gene variants or fibrocytes have shown controversial results on heterogeneous sets of IBD patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been already successfully proven in the recognition of fibrosis. Nevertheless, while there are no numerical models capable of systematically reproducing experiments, the usage of MRI could not be considered a standard in the inflammatory domain. Hence, there is an importance of deploying new sequence combinations in MRI methods that enable learning reproducible models. In this work, we provide reproducible deep learning models of intestinal fibrosis severity scores based on MRI novel radiation-induced rat model of colitis that incorporates some unexplored sequences such as the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery or diffusion imaging. The results obtained return an 87.5% of success in the prediction of MRI scores with an associated mean-square error of 0.12.

In the field of photovoltaics, the bandgap (E-g) is a well-recognized figure of merit for screening solar cell absorbers subject to the Shockley-Queisser limit. In this paper, the bandgap as the figure of merit is challenged since an ideal solar cell absorber requires multiple criteria such as stability, optical absorption, and carrier lifetime. Multiple criteria make the quantitative description of material candidates difficult and computationally time-consuming. Taking halide perovskites as an example, we combine thermodynamic stability (Delta H-d) and E-g into a unified figure of merit and use Bayesian optimization (BO) to accelerate materials screening. We have found that, in comparison to an exhaustive search via multiple parameters, BO based on the unified figure of merit can screen optimal candidates (E-g,E-PBE between 0.6-1.2 eV, Delta H-d>-29 meV per atom) more efficiently.

Recently, CPP has become a hotspot avenue for life science research and paved a new way of disease treatment without harmful impact on cell viability due to nontoxic characteristic. Therefore, the correct identification of CPPs will provide hints for medical applications. Considering the shortcomings of traditional experimental CPPs identification, it is urgently needed to design intelligent predictor for accurate identification of CPPs for the large scale uncharacterized sequences. We develop a novel computational method, called TargetCPP, to discriminate CPPs from Non-CPPs with improved accuracy. In TargetCPP, first the peptide sequences are formulated with four distinct encoding methods i.e., composite protein sequence representation, composition transition and distribution, split amino acid composition, and information theory features. These dominant feature vectors were fused and applied intelligent minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy feature selection method to choose an optimal subset of features. Finally, the predictive model is learned through different classification algorithms on the optimized features. Among these classifiers, gradient boost decision tree algorithm achieved excellent performance throughout the experiments. Notably, the TargetCPP tool attained high prediction Accuracy of 93.54% and 88.28% using jackknife and independent test, respectively.

One proposed solution is the use of quantitative ultrasound (US) techniques, such as image texture analysis, which has demonstrated discriminatory capabilities with other chronic pain conditions. From this, we propose the use of image texture variables to construct and compare two machine learning models (support vector machine [SVM] and logistic regression) for differentiating between the trapezius muscle in healthy and FM patients. US videos of the right and left trapezius muscle were acquired from healthy (n = 51) participants and those with FM (n = 57). The videos were converted into 64,800 skeletal muscle regions of interest (ROIs) using MATLAB. The ROIs were filtered by an algorithm using the complex wavelet structural similarity index (CW-SSIM), which removed ROIs that were similar. Thirty-one texture variables were extracted from the ROIs, which were then used in nested cross-validation to construct SVM and elastic net regularized logistic regression models. The generalized performance accuracy of both models was estimated and confirmed with a final validation on a holdout test set. The predicted generalized performance accuracy of the SVM and logistic regression models was computed to be 83.9 +/- 2.6% and 65.8 +/- 1.7%, respectively.

Furthermore, control of biomass gasification is not studied in the literature despite its importance for industrial applications. We conducted this study in two parts. Firstly, we developed a time-dependent identification model to describe and predict outcomes of biomass gasification using non-linear autoregressive with exogenous neural networks (NARXNN) and experimentally collected data set. The developed model showed exceptional success by reaching R-2 > 0.98 for all output variables. Secondly, we designed a model predictive controller (MPC) in order to control a certain output variable at the desired state. For this purpose, we created polynomial regression models and online optimization routines. Moreover, the designed controller is challenged in practical scenarios such as maximum hydrogen production to test its usability in practical applications. MPC showed satisfactory performance for all scenarios and also showed high compliance with the experimental data which further strengthened its practical usability potential. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the training of deep learning models requires not only a large number of samples, but also the need to set too many hyper-parameters, which is time consuming and laborious for researchers. This study used hyperspectral imaging technology combined with a deep learning model suitable for small-scale sample data sets, deep forests (DF) model, to classify rice seeds with different degrees of frost damage. During the period, three spectral preprocessing methods (Savitzky-Golay first derivative (SG1), standard normal variate (SNV), and multivariate scatter correction (MSC)) were used to process the original spectral data, and three feature extraction algorithms (principal component analysis (PCA), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and neighborhood component analysis (NCA)) were used to extract the characteristic wavelengths. Moreover, DF model and three traditional machine learning models (decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)) were built based on different numbers of sample sets. After multivariate data analysis, it showed that the pretreatment effect of MSC was the most excellent, and the characteristic wavelength extracted by NCA algorithm was the most useful. In addition, the performance of DF model was better than these three traditional classifier models, and it still performed well in small-scale sample set data. Therefore, DF model was chosen as the best classification model. The results of this study show that the DF model maintains good classification performance in small-scale sample set data, and it has a good application prospect in hyperspectral imaging technology.

In this paper, we propose a new data representation of electroencephalogram (EEG), which transforms 1D chain-like EEG vector sequences into 2D mesh-like matrix sequences. The mesh structure of the matrix at each time point corresponds to the electrodes' location of EEG headset, which could better represent the spatial correlation of EEG signals among multiple physically adjacent electrodes. Then, the sliding window is used to divide the 2D matrix sequences into segments containing equal time points, and each segment is seen as an EEG sample integrating the temporal and spatial correlation of raw EEG recordings. We also propose both cascaded and parallel hybrid convolution recurrent neural networks to accurately predict the emotional category of each EEG sample. Extensive binary emotion classification experiments in valence and arousal are carried out on a large scale DEAP dataset (32 subjects, 9,830,400 EEG recordings). The experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracies of both proposed hybrid networks on our spatial-temporal EEG representation achieve over 93%, which outperform the most recent baseline methods and other deep learning models in within-subject validation scenario. Our proposed methods and hybrid models effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of EEG emotion classification, which can be applied to develop affective BCI applications using consumer multi-electrode EEG headset.","EEG,Emotion recognition,Spatiotemporal feature,Convolutional recurrent neural network,Wearable multi-electrode headset,Affective BCI",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,2.935,,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,,

The mainstream human motion calculation method predicts human motion through offline machine learning techniques. Personalized monitoring poses new challenges to the original learning model. Aiming at the detection of R peak value of motion load signal and the location of QRS complex, an improved R-peak detection algorithm based on adaptive threshold is proposed. The feature extraction method of motion load signal is introduced from multiple dimensions. The characteristics of time domain features and frequency domain features are analyzed. The time domain features and the eigenvalues of frequency domain features are defined and extracted. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has higher detection accuracy. A multi-threshold-peak step algorithm is proposed and a motion state machine model is established. According to the periodic changes of the trunk movement and the arm swing acceleration in motion, the feature values are extracted, the step detection and the gait discrimination are performed, and the influence of external acceleration interference is excluded. The state machine adopts a nested structure, which is divided into two layers, a parent state and a child state, and calibrates the state transition condition. A verification method for the validity of feature parameters is proposed. The selected feature parameters are taken as an example to analyze and simulate the method.

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study conducted between November 2008 and July 2017, we included 73 patients diagnosed with GB (n = 73) and METs (n = 53) who underwent contrast-enhanced 3 T brain MRI. Twelve histogram and texture parameters were assessed on T2-weighted images (T2WIs), apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADCs), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WIs). A prediction model was developed for a machine learning method, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was calculated through 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, machine learning method's performance was compared with three board-certified radiologists' judgments.
Results: Univariate logistic regression model showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was highest with the standard value of T2WIs (0.78), followed by the maximum value of T2WIs (0.764), minimum value of T2WIs (0.738), minimum values of CE-T1WIs and contrast of T2WIs (0.733), and mean value of T2WIs (0.724). AUC calculated using the support vector machine was comparable to that calculated by the three radiologists (0.92 vs. 0.72, p <.01; 0.92 vs. 0.73, p <.01; and 0.92 vs. 0.86, p =.096).

From these, a feature set is computed analyzing the values of percentiles of distances of the foot from the floor, and passed to a modified version of Random Forest classifier, called Sigma-z Random Forest. The classifier considers the uncertainties associated to each feature set and provides both the classification of the gait phase (stance or swing) and an associated confidence value.

Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been widely used to build BCIs. However, currently developed algorithms do not predict the modulation of SSVEP amplitude, which is known to change as a function of stimulus luminance contrast. In this study, we aim to develop an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate the frequency and contrast-related amplitude modulations of the SSVEP signal. To achieve that, we developed a behavioral task in which human participants focused on a visual flicking target which the luminance contrast can change through time in several ways. SSVEP signals from 16 subjects were then recorded from electrodes placed at the central occipital site using a low-cost, consumer-grade EEG. Our results demonstrate that the filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) performed well in SSVEP frequency recognition, while the support vector regression (SVR) outperformed the other supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting the contrast-dependent amplitude modulations of the SSVEPs. These findings indicate the applicability and strong performance of our integrated method at simultaneously predicting both frequency and amplitude of visually evoked signals, and have proven to be useful for advancing SSVEP-based applications.","Electroencephalography,Frequency modulation,Amplitude modulation,Visualization,Computers,Signal to noise ratio,Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs),steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs),modulation of SSVEP amplitude,consumer-grade EEG,OpenBCI",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"CANONICAL,CORRELATION-ANALYSIS,STATE,ATTENTION,BCI,SYNCHRONIZATION,COMMUNICATION,MOVEMENT,SCHEME,GAIN,MEG",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07356.pdf,

For the safety control modeling problem, this paper develops a new Bayesian network (BN) transfer learning strategy for the thickening process of gold hydrometallurgy. First of all, the safety control modeling problem in this process is analyzed deeply. When the data information of abnormality is insufficient, the safety control modeling problem is transformed into the BN transfer learning problem. Furthermore, the new BN transfer learning strategy is proposed, which includes the structure and parameters transfer learning methods. For the structure transfer learning, by integrating the common structural information of multiple sources and the useful information of target, the final structure of target is determined. For the parameters transfer learning, by distinguishing the similarity of multiple sources, the parameters of target are obtained by the fusion algorithm.

This shift will put pressure on existing infrastructure and utility companies to meet a demand that was not accounted for in the initial design of the systems. Furthermore, the traditional linear models typically used to predict energy demand focus on isolating either the electricity or natural gas demand, even though the two demands are highly interconnected. This practice often leads to less accurate predictions for both demand profiles. Here, we propose a multivariate, multi-sector (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial) framework to model the climate sensitivity of the coupled electricity and natural gas demand simultaneously, leveraging advanced statistical learning algorithms. Our results indicate that the season-to-date heating and cooling degree-days, as well as the dew point temperature are the key predictors for both the electricity and natural gas demand. We also found that the energy sector is most sensitive to climate during the autumn and spring (intermediate) seasons, followed by the summer and winter seasons. Moreover, the proposed model outperforms a similar univariate model in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating the importance of accounting for the interdependence within the energy sectors. By providing accurate predictions of the electricity and natural gas demand, the proposed framework can help infrastructure planners and operators make informed decisions towards ensuring balanced energy delivery and minimizing supply inadequacy risks under future climate variability and change.","Coupled electricity-natural gas demand,Climate-energy nexus,Season-specific climate sensitivity,Multi-sector approach,Multivariate analysis,Predictive modeling",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,9.953,"REGIONAL,ENERGY,DEMAND,METHODOLOGY,IMPACT,STATE,CONSUMPTION,SECTOR,LEVEL",APPLIED ENERGY,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0306261919321063,

Based on the clustering analysis, matrix cracking and shear failure of the adhesive layer are demonstrated to be fundamental and characteristic damage modes, respectively. Meanwhile, similarities of AE signals for various damage modes in the subspace of AE features are explored in detail. The interface debonding (fiber/matrix interface debonding and adhesive failure) and the cracking of polymer (matrix cracking and cohesive failure) behave similarly in the subspace of selected AE features.

The benchmarking effort in the present work quantifies the performance of SL algorithms with respect to a breadth of research goals: discovery of any ""good"" material, discovery of all ""good"" materials, and discovery of a model that accurately predicts the performance of new materials. To benchmark the effectiveness of different machine learning models against these goals, we use datasets in which the performance of all materials in the search space is known from high-throughput synthesis and electrochemistry experiments.

The sera of 499 people infected with the hepatitis B virus and 435 healthy controls were measured in this experiment. The data were subjected to a dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis. Then, the features of multiple scales were preserved and fused by a multiscale fusion convolution operation. The gated recurrent unit network was added to extract time series features and finally output the result of the classification through a softmax layer. A diagnostic model based on a gated recurrent unit and multiscale fusion convolutional neural network was constructed and evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation method. Compared to existing analysis methods for serum Raman spectroscopy, the proposed model achieved the best performance. The combination of Raman spectroscopy and deep learning models is expected to be applied well in the early screening of hepatitis B and is a promising screening method.","Gated recursive unit,hepatitis B virus,principal component analysis,Raman spectroscopy",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Spectroscopy,,1.176,"CANCER,CHOLESTEROL,SERUM",SPECTROSCOPY LETTERS,,

Magnetic and superconducting materials exhibit a number of unique properties that make them useful in a wide variety of applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, solid-state refrigerants, photon detectors and metrology devices. In all these applications, phase transitions play an important role in determining the feasibility of the materials in question. Here, we present a pipeline for fully integrating data extracted from the scientific literature into machine-learning tools for property prediction and materials discovery. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning techniques, we successfully reconstruct the phase diagrams of well-known magnetic and superconducting compounds, and demonstrate that it is possible to predict the phase-transition temperatures of compounds not present in the database. We provide the tool as an online open-source platform, forming the basis for further research into magnetic and superconducting materials discovery for potential device applications.","CRYSTALLOGRAPHY OPEN DATABASE,OPEN-ACCESS COLLECTION,MATERIALS DISCOVERY,DESIGN,MAGNDATA",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science",,13.993,"CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,OPEN,DATABASE,OPEN-ACCESS,COLLECTION,MATERIALS,DISCOVERY,DESIGN,MAGNDATA",NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-0287-8.pdf,

A key problem is the lack of informative representations of parameters that translate directly into biological function. Here we present a platform to relate the effects of cell morphology to gene expression induced by nanotopography. This platform utilizes the 'morphome', a multivariate dataset of cell morphology parameters. We create a Bayesian linear regression model that uses the morphome to robustly predict changes in bone, cartilage, muscle and fibrous gene expression induced by nanotopography. Furthermore, through this model we effectively predict nanotopography-induced gene expression from a complex co-culture microenvironment. The information from the morphome uncovers previously unknown effects of nanotopography on altering cell-cell interaction and osteogenic gene expression at the single cell level. The predictive relationship between morphology and gene expression arising from cell-material interaction shows promise for exploration of new topographies.","MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS,MC3T3-E1 CELLS,DIFFERENTIATION,ADHESION,TOPOGRAPHY,NANOSTRUCTURES,FIBROBLASTS,MYOBLASTS,DYNAMICS,CULTURE",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"MESENCHYMAL,STEM-CELLS,MC3T3-E1,CELLS,DIFFERENTIATION,ADHESION,TOPOGRAPHY,NANOSTRUCTURES,FIBROBLASTS,MYOBLASTS,DYNAMICS,CULTURE",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/04/16/495879.full.pdf,

Inspired by biological somatosensory systems, we report an optoelectronic spiking afferent nerve with neural coding, perceptual learning and memorizing capabilities to mimic tactile sensing and processing. Our system senses pressure by MXene-based sensors, converts pressure information to light pulses by coupling light-emitting diodes to analog-to-digital circuits, then integrates light pulses using a synaptic photomemristor. With neural coding, our spiking nerve is capable of not only detecting simultaneous pressure inputs, but also recognizing Morse code, braille, and object movement. Furthermore, with dimensionality-reduced feature extraction and learning, our system can recognize and memorize handwritten alphabets and words, providing a promising approach towards e-skin, neurorobotics and human-machine interaction technologies.",,Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7070032,

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,"Purpose To generate fully automated and fast 4D-flow MRI-based 3D segmentations of the aorta using deep learning for reproducible quantification of aortic flow, peak velocity, and dimensions. Methods A total of 1018 subjects with aortic 4D-flow MRI (528 with bicuspid aortic valve, 376 with tricuspid aortic valve and aortic dilation, 114 healthy controls) comprised the data set. A convolutional neural network was trained to generate 3D aortic segmentations from 4D-flow data. Manual segmentations served as the ground truth (N= 499 training,N= 101 validation,N= 418 testing). Dice scores, Hausdorff distance, and average symmetrical surface distance were calculated to assess performance. Aortic flow, peak velocity, and lumen dimensions were quantified at the ascending, arch, and descending aorta and compared using Bland-Altman analysis. Interobserver variability of manual analysis was assessed on a subset of 40. Results Convolutional neural network segmentation required 0.438 +/- 0.355 seconds versus 630 +/- 254 seconds for manual analysis and demonstrated excellent performance with a median Dice score of 0.951 (0.930-0.966), Hausdorff distance of 2.80 (2.13-4.35), and average symmetrical surface distance of 0.176 (0.119-0.290). Excellent agreement was found for flow, peak velocity, and dimensions with low bias and limits of agreement less than 10% difference versus manual analysis. For aortic volume, limits of agreement were moderate within 16.3%. Interobserver variability (median Dice score: 0.950; Hausdorff distance: 2.45; and average symmetrical surface distance: 0.145) and convolutional neural network-based analysis (median Dice score: 0.953-0.959; Hausdorff distance: 2.24-2.91; and average symmetrical surface distance: 0.145-1.98 to observers) demonstrated similar reproducibility. Conclusions Deep learning enabled fast and automated 3D aortic segmentation from 4D-flow MRI, demonstrating its potential for efficient clinical workflows. Future studies should investigate its utility for other vasculature and multivendor applications.","4D flow MRI,hemodynamics,machine learning,MRI,thoracic aorta",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"PHASE-CONTRAST,MRI,VELOCITY",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724647,

Here, we explore the evolution of material-level optoelectronic properties as MAPbI(3) degrades and discover universal behaviors where the carrier diffusion length (L-D) decays before quasi-Fermi-level splitting (Delta E-F), regardless of the specific stress protocol (oxygen, humidity, thermal stress, or a combination). We employ a machine learning greedy feature selection model that uses initially measured properties to predict the time it takes L-D to decrease to 85% of its initial value with a prediction accuracy of 12.8%. This model reveals a strong correlation between the initial rate of transmittance change and the time until loss of transport. We translate this material-level finding to photovoltaic device-level forecasting by demonstrating that the rate of change of transmittance is equivalent to the rate of change of the spatial standard deviation of dark-field image intensity (i.e., scattered light intensity) collected in reflection mode (and thus applicable to devices with opaque contacts). This work demonstrates that transmittance and scattering methods are highly effective for accelerated material (and device) stability evaluation and forecasting.","SOLAR-CELLS,INDUCED DEGRADATION,THIN-FILMS,STABILITY,EFFICIENCY,PHOTOVOLTAICS,MAPBI(3),VOLTAGE,LIGHT,STATE",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Electrochemistry,Energy & Fuels,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,22.423,"SOLAR-CELLS,INDUCED,DEGRADATION,THIN-FILMS,STABILITY,EFFICIENCY,PHOTOVOLTAICS,MAPBI%283%29,VOLTAGE,LIGHT,STATE",ACS ENERGY LETTERS,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1675158,

Molecular-level thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural data extracted from the resulting trajectories provide valuable information for the understanding, engineering, and design of biological and molecular materials. The cost of simulating many-body atomic systems makes simulations of large molecules prohibitively expensive, and the high-dimensionality of the resulting trajectories presents a challenge for analysis. Driven by advances in algorithms, hardware, and data availability, there has been a flare of interest in recent years in the applications of machine learning - especially deep learning - to molecular simulation. These techniques have demonstrated great power and flexibility in both extracting mechanistic understanding of the important nonlinear collective variables governing the dynamics of a molecular system, and in furnishing good low-dimensional system representations with which to perform enhanced sampling or develop long-timescale dynamical models. It is the purpose of this article to introduce the key machine learning approaches, describe how they are married with statistical mechanical theory into domain-specific tools, and detail applications of these approaches in understanding and accelerating biomolecular simulation.","machine learning,molecular simulation,deep learning,enhanced sampling,collective variables",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Physics",,1.988,"DYNAMIC-MODE,DECOMPOSITION,FREE-ENERGY,LANDSCAPES,MARKOV,STATE,MODELS,NONLINEAR,DIMENSIONALITY,REDUCTION,WORLDS,FASTEST,COMPUTER,ONE,BILLION,ATOMS,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,VARIATIONAL,APPROACH,MATERIALS,FAILURE,ORDER,PARAMETERS",MOLECULAR PHYSICS,,
