1,A data-driven surrogate to image-based flow simulations in porous media,201,,,"Takbiri-Borujeni Ali,Kazemi Hadi,Nasrabadi Nasser","Takbiri-Borujeni A,Kazemi H,Nasrabadi N",Takbiri-Borujeni A,10.1016/j.compfluid.2020.104475,West Virginia University,"The objective for this work is to develop a data-driven surrogate to high-fidelity numerical flow simulations using digital images of porous media. The proposed model can capture the pixel-scale velocity vectors in a large verity of digital porous media created by random two-dimensional (2D) circle packs. To develop the model, images of the 2D media (binary images of solid grains and void spaces) along with their corresponding velocity vectors at the pixel level computed using lattice Boltzmann simulation runs are used to train and to predict the solutions with a high accuracy in much less computational time. The velocity vector predictions made by the surrogate models are used to compute the permeability tensor for samples that have not been used in the training. The results show high accuracy in the prediction of both velocity vectors and permeability tensors. The proposed methodology harness the enormous amount of generated data from high-fidelity flow simulations to decode the often under-utilized patterns in simulations and to accurately predict solutions to new cases. The developed model can truly capture the physics of the problem and enhance the prediction capabilities of the simulations at a much lower cost. These predictive models, in essence, do not spatially reduce the order of the problem. They, however, possess the same numerical resolutions as their Lattice Boltzmann simulations equivalents do with the great advantage that their solutions can be achieved by a significant reduction in computational costs (speed and memory).

Uncertainties derived from geometry, material and models are elaborately quantified based on the data from measurements and experiments. A Bayesian approach is used for uncertainty quantification, where Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to estimate posterior distributions. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is introduced to describe the propagation of uncertainties and improve the efficiency in high-dimensional analysis. With the integrated methodology, uncertainties are embodied in life prediction results of a whole turbine disc. A full-scale spin test is carried out under low cycle fatigue loading, where three effective crack samples are generated and monitored. Compared with the experimental results, the mean values of the predictions are bounded within a factor of +/- 2.0, validating the potential usage of the proposed method in the probabilistic FCG life assessment.","Bayesian method,Uncertainty quantification,Fatigue crack growth,Full-scale experiment,Gaussian process regression",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Mechanics,,4.243,"INITIAL,FLAW,SIZE,LIFE,PREDICTION,UNCERTAINTY,FRACTURE,SUPERALLOY,INFERENCE,GH4169",ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS,,

Experiments conducted with non-optimal processing procedures cause waste of the materials and may lead to inaccurate conclusions. Moreover, classifying the fuel material becomes harder when the material is already processed or collected from an environment that makes it difficult to discern. Thus, with the constantly developing and diversifying energy applications, the need for a framework that can classify solid fuels is increased. In this study, we used machine learning based approach to classify fuels with the use of proximate analysis results, i.e., fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash contents. We collected a data set from the literature and group them into four classes, i.e., coals, woods, agricultural residue and manufactured biomass. Then, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and random forest machine learning classifiers are employed to develop prediction models. Furthermore, hierarchical classification approach is taken to combine each classifier's advantages with integration of expert opinion to create a complete and highly accurate classifier framework which can classify an unknown fuel into one of the four categories. K-fold cross validation is used to evaluate classifiers' performances in unbiased manner. With hierarchical classifier, % 96 and %92 classification accuracy is achieved for training and testing phases, respectively.

Cracks resulted from manufacturing processes or previous loading will seriously undermine the safety of the engineering structures and even lead to catastrophic industrial accidents. Accurate and quantitative characterization the cracks in ferromagnetic steels are therefore of vital importance. In this paper, the cracks in ferromagnetic steels are detected by the pulsed eddy current (PEC) technique. Firstly, the physical mechanism of the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic steel on the detection signal of PEC is interpreted from a microscopic level of magnetic domain wall movement. The relationship of the crack width/depth and the detection signal of PEC is then investigated and verified by numerical simulations and experimental study. Finally, the cracks are inversely characterized by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Back-Propagation (BP) neural network (NN) considering the nonlinearity of the crack geometric parameters with the detection signal of PEC. The prediction results indicated that the proposed algorithm can characterize the crack depth and width within the relative error of 10%. The proposed approach combining PEC and GA based BPNN has been verified to quantitatively detect cracks in ferromagnetic steel.","Ferromagnetic steels,Pulsed eddy current (PEC) technique,Crack,GA based BP neural network,Magnetic domain wall",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Materials Science,Physics",,2.836,"SENSOR,SIGNAL",JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS,,

Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs), which are designed to use multiple vehicles to transfer materials, are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Traffic control is a significant challenge with AVSs because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time, to cope with uncertainties such as congestion. However, existing traffic control systems, which are primarily designed and controlled by human experts, are insufficient to prevent heavy congestion that impedes production. In this study, we developed a traffic control system based on machine learning predictions, and a routing method that dynamically determines AVS routes with reduced congestion rates. We predicted congestion for critical bottleneck areas, and utilized the predictions for adaptive routing control of all vehicles to avoid congestion. We conducted an experimental evaluation to compare the predictive performance of four popular algorithms. We performed a simulation study based on data from semiconductor fabrication to demonstrate the utility and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that AVSs with the proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of delivery time, transfer time, and queuing time. We found that adopting machine learning-based traffic control can enhance the performance of existing AVSs and reduce the burden on the human experts who monitor and control AVSs.

Taking ethane-ethylene separation as a case study, we demonstrated that machine learning could provide data-driven insight into how the defects control the performance of UiO-66-Ds in adsorption, separation, and mechanical stability. We found that the missing-linker ratio in real materials could be predicted from the gravimetric surface area and pore volume, making it a useful complement for the challenges of directly measuring the defect concentration. We further identified the ""privileged"" UiO-66-Ds that were optimal in overall properties and provided decision trees as guidance to access and design these top performers.

The starting double-cation perovskite resulting from the incorporation of 15% dimethylammonium (DMA) in methyl-ammonium lead triiodide suffers from significant deviation from the perovskite structure. By analyzing the X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, we confirmed that it is possible to recover the perovskite structure with the cubic phase at room temperature (RT) while minimizing the iterations of trial-and-error by adding <10 mol % of cesium cation additives, as guided by the machine learning predictor. Our conclusions highly support the cubic-phase stabilization at RT by controlling the stoichiometric ratio of various sized cations.

In recent years, data sets have been created to train artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize patterns of pain intensity. The multimodal recognition of pain with machine learning could provide a way to reduce an over- or undersupply of analgesics, explicitly in patients with limited communication skills. Objectives This study investigated the methodology of automated multimodal recognition of pain intensity and modality using machine-learning techniques of artificial intelligence. Multimodal recognition rates of experimentally induced phasic electrical and heat pain stimuli were compared with uni- and bimodal recognition rates. Material and methods On the basis of the X-ITE Pain Database, healthy subjects were stimulated with phasic electro-induced pain and heat pain, and their corresponding pain responses were recorded with multimodal sensors (acoustic, video-based, physiological). After complex signal processing, machine-learning methods were used to calculate recognition rates with respect to pain intensity (baseline vs. pain threshold, pain tolerance, mean value of pain threshold and tolerance) and pain modality (electrical vs. heat). Finally, a statistical comparison of uni- vs. multimodal and bi- vs. multimodal detection rates was performed. Results With few exceptions, multimodal recognition of pain intensity rates was statistically superior to unimodal recognition rates, regardless of the pain modality. Multimodal pain recognition distinguished significantly better between heat and electro-induced pain. Further, multimodal recognition rates were predominantly superior to bimodal recognition rates. Conclusion Priority should be given to the multimodal approach to the recognition of pain intensity and modality compared with unimodality. Further clinical studies should clarify whether multimodal automated recognition of pain intensity and modality is in fact superior to bimodal recognition.","Automated pain recognition,Machine learning,Artificial intelligence,Multimodality,Fusion algorithms",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Anesthesiology,Neurosciences & Neurology",,1.382,,SCHMERZ,,

In this perspective, we discuss recent advances in inverse methods for design of soft materials that address two challenges: (1) methodological limitations that prevent such approaches from satisfying design constraints and (2) computational challenges that limit the size and complexity of systems that can be addressed. Strategies that leverage machine learning have proven particularly effective, including methods to discover order parameters that characterize complex structural motifs and schemes to efficiently compute macroscopic properties from the underlying structure. We also highlight promising opportunities to improve the experimental realizability of materials designed computationally, including discovery of materials with functionality at multiple thermodynamic states, design of externally directed assembly protocols that are simple to implement in experiments, and strategies to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of experimentally relevant models.","STRUCTURE-PROPERTY LINKAGES,SELF-ASSEMBLY PATHWAYS,TOPOGRAPHICAL TEMPLATES,CAPILLARY MIGRATION,BLOCK-COPOLYMERS,LOCAL-STRUCTURE,ORDER,OPTIMIZATION,IDENTIFICATION,FABRICATION",Article,"AMER INST PHYSICS, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"STRUCTURE-PROPERTY,LINKAGES,SELF-ASSEMBLY,PATHWAYS,TOPOGRAPHICAL,TEMPLATES,CAPILLARY,MIGRATION,BLOCK-COPOLYMERS,LOCAL-STRUCTURE,ORDER,OPTIMIZATION,IDENTIFICATION,FABRICATION",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5145177,

In many cases, DFTB can provide comparable accuracy to DFT at a fraction of the cost, enabling simulations on length and time scales that are unfeasible with first-principles DFT. At the same time (and in contrast to empirical interatomic potentials and force fields), DFTB still offers direct access to electronic properties such as the band structure. These advantages come at the cost of introducing empirical parameters to the method, leading to a reduced transferability compared to true first-principle approaches. Consequently, it would be very useful if the parameter sets could be routinely adjusted for a given project. While fairly robust and transferable parametrization workflows exist for the electronic structure part of DFTB, the so-called repulsive potential V(rep )poses a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning (ML) approach to fitting V-rep, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct V-rep with DFT- DFTB force residues as training data. The use of GPR circumvents the need for nonlinear or global parameter optimization, while at the same time offering arbitrary flexibility in terms of the functional form. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to multiple elements at once, by fitting repulsive potentials for organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Overall, the new approach removes focus from the choice of functional form and parametrization procedure, in favor of a data-driven philosophy.","ENERGY SURFACES,COMPLEX MATERIALS,DFTB PARAMETERS,PERIODIC-TABLE,MOLECULES,HYDROGEN,APPROXIMATIONS,OPTIMIZATION,SIMULATIONS,CHEMISTRY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,6.652,"ENERGY,SURFACES,COMPLEX,MATERIALS,DFTB,PARAMETERS,PERIODIC-TABLE,MOLECULES,HYDROGEN,APPROXIMATIONS,OPTIMIZATION,SIMULATIONS,CHEMISTRY",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION,,

Unfortunately, the intrinsic heterogeneity and enhanced disorder characteristic of catalytic materials experiencing structural transformations under reaction conditions, as well as the low signal-to-noise ratio that is common for in situ EXAFS spectra hinder the application of conventional data analysis approaches. Here we address this problem by employing machine learning methods (artificial neural networks) to establish the relationship between EXAFS features and structural motifs in metals as well as oxide materials.

While structure-property relationships can be accurately determined using quantum mechanical methods, these first-principles calculations are computationally demanding, limiting their use in screening a large set of candidate structures. Herein, we use convolutional neural networks to develop a predictive model for the electronic properties of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) that have a billions-range materials design space. We show that a well-designed hierarchical ML approach has a higher fidelity in predicting properties of the MHPs compared to straight-forward methods.

Using the hierarchical ML scheme, the obtained root-mean-square errors for the lattice constants, octahedral angle and bandgap for the MHPs are 0.01 angstrom, 5 degrees, and 0.02 eV, respectively.

It is a self-contained explosive device placed in water to destroy ships or submarines. Due to various factors like variations in operating and target shapes, environmental conditions, presence of spatially varying clutter, compositions and orientation, detection and classification of sonar imagery with respect to underwater objects is a complicated problem. It is well known that many post processing techniques in image processing have done to receive high resolution images to distinguish the objects. However the mentioned technique needs a special method to detect the metal from the usual sub bottom materials mainly rocks. Hence the data collection made in simulated environment locating metals in rock bed and collected with the sonar and the distinguished features of metals from rock have been identified with the totally different approach called intruder detection technique using data mining/machine learning. This paper proposes a novel approach for discriminating and detection of objects in underwater environment with accuracy of 90% (full feature set) and 86% (selected feature set). Hence, it is quite revealing that the new technique is better in classification of mine like objects in underwater, justified with samples of sonar data sets.","Uwcns,UWSNs,Mine detection,Machine learning,Data mining,KNN classifier,Gradient booster,Decision tree,SVM",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,6.163,,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,

Depending on the degree of geometrical complexity, inversion techniques are often used to estimate layer-by-layer electrical properties from measurements. When used for well geosteering purposes, it becomes essential to invert the measurements into layer-by-layer values of electrical resistivity in real time. We explore the possibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform rapid inversion of borehole resistivity measurements. Accordingly, we construct a DNN that approximates the following inverse problem: given a set of borehole resistivity measurements, the DNN is designed to deliver a physically reliable and data-consistent piecewise one-dimensional layered model of the surrounding subsurface. Once the DNN is constructed, we can invert borehole measurements in real time. We illustrate the performance of the DNN for inverting logging-while-drilling (LWD) measurements acquired in high-angle wells via synthetic examples.

Research on magnetocaloric lanthanum manganites with a large maximum magnetic entropy change near room temperature shows promising results for further developments of magnetic refrigeration devices. By incorporating chemical substitutions, oxygen content modifications, and various synthesis methods, these manganites experience lattice distortions from perovskite cubic structures to pseudocubic, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral structures. Further changes in lattice parameters can also be achieved by the introduction of strain due to lattice mismatches. Empirical results and previous models through thermodynamics and first principles show that changes in lattice parameters correlate with those in MMCE, but correlations are merely general tendencies and obviously not universal. In this work, the Gaussian process regression model is developed as a machine learning tool to find statistical correlations between the MMCE and lattice parameters among lanthanum manganites. More than 100 lattices, cubic, pseudocubic, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral, with the MMCE ranging from 0.65 to 8.00Jkg(-1)K(-1) under a field change of 5 T are explored for this purpose. The modeling approach demonstrates a high degree of accuracy and stability, contributing to efficient and low-cost estimations of the magnetocaloric effect. Furthermore, the machine learning algorithm predicts close MMCE results on epitaxial films with strained lattices against experimental results, which can provide guidance on thin film structure design and help understandings of magnetic phase transformations and magnetocaloric effects.","Magnetic entropy,Gaussian process regression,Lattice parameters,Magnetocalorics,Manganite",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Materials Science,Physics",,2.111,"MAGNETIC,ENTROPY,CHANGE,CRITICAL-BEHAVIOR,ROOM-TEMPERATURE,FE,NI,SUBSTITUTION,CR,CO",APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING,,

Methods We optimized a set of STFR scans to minimize the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound of MWF estimates. We evaluated the RMSE of MWF estimates from the optimized scans in simulation. We compared STFR-based MWF estimates (both modeling exchange and not modeling exchange) to multi-echo spin echo (MESE)-based estimates. We used the optimized scans to acquire in vivo data from which a MWF map was estimated. We computed the STFR-based MWF estimates using PERK, a recently developed kernel regression technique, and the MESE-based MWF estimates using both regularized non-negative least squares (NNLS) and PERK.
Results In simulation, the optimized STFR scans led to estimates of MWF with low RMSE across a range of tissue parameters and across white matter and gray matter. The STFR-based MWF estimates that modeled exchange compared well to MESE-based MWF estimates in simulation. When the optimized scans were tested in vivo, the MWF map that was estimated using a 3-compartment model with exchange was closer to the MESE-based MWF map.
Conclusions The optimized STFR scans appear to be well suited for estimating MWF in simulation and in vivo when we model exchange in training. In this case, the STFR-based MWF estimates are close to the MESE-based estimates.","kernel ridge regression,machine learning,myelin water fraction (MWF),scan optimization,small-tip fast recovery (STFR)",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"BRAIN,T-1",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7478173,

Particularly, the discrete constrained objective function in the hash code learning is optimized iteratively, where the binary code can be directly solved with no need for relaxation. In the meantime, the semantic similarity is maintained by fully exploring supervision information during the discrete optimization, where the neighborhood structure of training data is preserved by applying a graph regularization term. Additionally, to gain the fine-grained ranking of the returned medical images sharing the same Hamming distance, a novel image re-ranking scheme is proposed to refine the similarity measurement by jointly considering Euclidean distance between the real-valued feature descriptors and their category information between those images.

The influence mechanism of metastable austenite on fatigue property by relevant scholars under different service conditions such as low cycle fatigue and high cycle fatigue was reviewed.

Recently, deep CNNs were individually applied to solve the specific problems. But, pretrained CNN models with transfer learning can utilize the previous knowledge to solve the other related problems. In the proposed approach, initially data preprocessing is performed for standardization of exudate patches. Furthermore, region of interest (ROI) localization is used to localize the features of exudates, and then transfer learning is performed for feature extraction using pretrained CNN models (Inception-v3, Residual Network-50, and Visual Geometry Group Network-19). Moreover, the fused features from fully connected (FC) layers are fed into the softmax classifier for exudate classification.

Nowadays it is the most widely used non-invasive technique for the continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and the uterine contraction pressure (UCP). Though its introduction limited the birth related problems, the accuracy of interpretation was hindered by quite a few factors. Different guidelines that are provided for the interpretation are based on crisp logic which fails to capture the inherent uncertainty present in the medical diagnosis. Misinterpretations had led to inaccurate diagnosis which resulted in many medico-legal litigations. The vagueness present in the physician's evaluation is best modeled using soft-computing based techniques.

The stochastic backpropagation was utilized to calculate the descent gradient in the process of maximum a posterior, and a projected subgradient method was used to impose the equality constraint. In contrast to the other deep learning reconstruction methods, the proposed one used the likelihood of prior as the training loss and the objective function in reconstruction to improve the image quality. Results The proposed method showed an improved performance in preserving image details and reducing aliasing artifacts, compared with GRAPPA,l1-ESPRiT, model-based deep learning architecture for inverse problems (MODL), and variational network (VN), last two were state-of-the-art deep learning reconstruction methods. The proposed method generally achieved more than 3 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement for compressed sensing and parallel imaging reconstructions compared with the other methods. Conclusions The Bayesian estimation significantly improved the reconstruction performance, compared with the conventionall1-sparsity prior in compressed sensing reconstruction tasks. More importantly, the proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most MRI reconstruction scenarios.","Bayesian estimation,compressed sensing,deep learning reconstruction,generative network,parallel imaging",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01127,

To tackle this issue,a regional-content-aware weighted NNM algorithm was proposed for LDCT image denoising. Firstly,a Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)based method was proposed to estimate the local noise intensity in LDCT image. Then,the target image block matching was performed based on the local statistical characteristics. Finally,the weights of the nuclear norms were adaptively set based on both the local noise intensity of the image and the different singular value levels,and the weighted NNM based LDCT image denoising was realized. The simulation results illustrated that the proposed algorithm decreased the Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)index by 30.11%,14.38% and 8.75% respectively compared with the traditional NNM,total variation minimization and transform learning algorithms,and improved the Structural SIMilarity(SSIM)index by 34.24%,23.06% and 11.52% respectively compared with the above three algorithms. The experimental results on real clinical data illustrated that the mean value of the radiologists'scores of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm was 8.94,which is only 0.21 lower than that of the corresponding full dose CT images,and was significantly higher than those of the traditional NNM,total variation minimization and transform learning algorithms.

However, when developing tools for these purposes, it is important to design applications that will effectively transfer to the real world. Therefore, it is essential to understand whether motor skills transfer between HMD-VR and conventional screen-based environments and what factors predict transfer. Methods We randomized 70 healthy participants into two groups. Both groups trained on a well-established measure of motor skill acquisition, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), either in HMD-VR or in a conventional environment (i.e., computer screen). We then tested whether the motor skills transferred from HMD-VR to the computer screen, and vice versa. After the completion of the experiment, participants responded to questions relating to their presence in their respective training environment, age, gender, video game use, and previous HMD-VR experience. Using multivariate and univariate linear regression, we then examined whether any personal factors from the questionnaires predicted individual differences in motor skill transfer between environments. Results Our results suggest that motor skill acquisition of this task occurs at the same rate in both HMD-VR and conventional screen environments. However, the motor skills acquired in HMD-VR did not transfer to the screen environment. While this decrease in motor skill performance when moving to the screen environment was not significantly predicted by self-reported factors, there were trends for correlations with presence and previous HMD-VR experience. Conversely, motor skills acquired in a conventional screen environment not only transferred but improved in HMD-VR, and this increase in motor skill performance could be predicted by self-reported factors of presence, gender, age and video game use. Conclusions These findings suggest that personal factors may predict who is likely to have better transfer of motor skill to and from HMD-VR. Future work should examine whether these and other predictors (i.e., additional personal factors such as immersive tendencies and task-specific factors such as fidelity or feedback) also apply to motor skill transfer from HMD-VR to more dynamic physical environments.","Virtual reality,Head-mounted display,Motor skill acquisition,Transfer,Presence",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Engineering,Neurosciences & Neurology,Rehabilitation",,5.218,"ACQUISITION,SELECTION,CONTEXT,STROKE,2D",JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149857,

However, it has a number of shortcomings, particularly in predicting key properties, such as band gap and optical spectra, which are dependent on excited states. To treat such properties, more accurate approaches such as GW or DFT with hybrid functionals (including HSE, PBE0, and B3LYP, to name a few) can be employed; however, these approaches are unfeasible for many large and/or complex systems due to their high computational cost and large memory requirements. In this work, we investigate the ability to train neural networks of the traditional DFT charge density computed with a standard PBE functional to accurately predict HSE band gaps. We show that a single network PBE charge density functional can predict the HSE band gap of seven different materials-silicon, gallium arsenide, molybdenum disulfide, germanium, tin phosphate, titanium phosphate, and zirconium phosphate-under a wide variety of conditions with an RSME of 172.6 meV, which is 34% better accuracy than standard regression between the PBE and HSE band gaps.

Polymeric materials are a very important class of soft materials and widely used nowadays. Polymers have unique strain localization behavior such as crazing during tensile deformation. How to understand the mechanism at the molecular level of strain localization in polymeric materials has become an important topic in material science. In this work, tensile deformation process of polymers both under a melt state and a glassy state are investigated in MD simulations using a generic coarse-grained model. We use a machine learning technique, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, to understand the local molecular structure and the dynamical properties during tensile deformation. By defining ""softness"" from the SVM model, we investigate the stress-strain behavior of both ductile polymer above glass transition temperature and brittle polymer glass during tensile deformation. We demonstrated that the softness can be used to predict physical properties efficiently; the softness provides deep physical insights into the non-equilibrium stress-strain process.

Using chronic wide-field calcium imaging, we reveal two phases of spatiotemporal refinement of layer 2/3 cortical activity in mice learning whisker-based texture discrimination in the dark. Even before mice reach learning threshold, association cortex-including rostro-lateral (RL), posteromedial (PM), and retrosplenial dorsal (RD) areas-is generally suppressed early during trials (between auditory start cue and whisker-texture touch). As learning proceeds, a spatiotemporal activation sequence builds up, spreading from auditory areas to RL immediately before texture touch (whereas PM and RD remain suppressed) and continuing into barrel cortex, which eventually efficiently discriminates between textures. Additional correlation analysis substantiates this diverging learning-related refinement within association cortex. Our results indicate that a pre-learning phase of general suppression in association cortex precedes a learning-related phase of task-specific signal flow enhancement. Learning is a dynamic process involving many cortical areas. Here, using cortex-wide imaging, the authors show that in mice learning to discriminate between two textures a distinct task related signal flow is enhanced involving a specific association area whereas other association areas are suppressed.","LONG-RANGE,PARIETAL CORTEX,PROJECTION NEURONS,GABAERGIC NEURONS,PREFRONTAL CORTEX,TRANSGENIC MICE,VISUAL-CORTEX,DECISION,MEMORY,CIRCUIT",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,15.805,"LONG-RANGE,PARIETAL,CORTEX,PROJECTION,NEURONS,GABAERGIC,NEURONS,PREFRONTAL,CORTEX,TRANSGENIC,MICE,VISUAL-CORTEX,DECISION,MEMORY,CIRCUIT",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142160,

Using these images effectively typically requires the physician to manually segment the prostate to define the margins used for accurate registration, targeting, and other guidance techniques. However, manual prostate segmentation is a time-consuming and difficult intraoperative process, often occurring while the patient is under sedation (biopsy) or anesthetic (brachytherapy). Minimizing procedure time with a 3D TRUS prostate segmentation method could provide physicians with a quick and accurate prostate segmentation, and allow for an efficient workflow with improved patient throughput to enable faster patient access to care. The purpose of this study was to develop a supervised deep learning-based method to segment the prostate in 3D TRUS images from different facilities, generated using multiple acquisition methods and commercial ultrasound machine models to create a generalizable algorithm for needle-based prostate cancer procedures. Methods Our proposed method for 3D segmentation involved prediction on two-dimensional (2D) slices sampled radially around the approximate central axis of the prostate, followed by reconstruction into a 3D surface. A 2D U-Net was modified, trained, and validated using images from 84 end-fire and 122 side-fire 3D TRUS images acquired during clinical biopsies and brachytherapy procedures. Modifications to the expansion section of the standard U-Net included the addition of 50% dropouts and the use of transpose convolutions instead of standard upsampling followed by convolution to reduce overfitting and improve performance, respectively. Manual contours provided the annotations needed for the training, validation, and testing datasets, with the testing dataset consisting of 20 end-fire and 20 side-fire unseen 3D TRUS images. Since predicting with 2D images has the potential to lose spatial and structural information, comparisons to 3D reconstruction and optimized 3D networks including 3D V-Net, Dense V-Net, and High-resolution 3D-Net were performed following an investigation into different loss functions. An extended selection of absolute and signed error metrics were computed, including pixel map comparisons [dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision], volume percent differences (VPD), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), to assess 3D segmentation accuracy. Results Overall, our proposed reconstructed modified U-Net performed with a median [first quartile, third quartile] absolute DSC, recall, precision, VPD, MSD, and HD of 94.1 [92.6, 94.9]%, 96.0 [93.1, 98.5]%, 93.2 [88.8, 95.4]%, 5.78 [2.49, 11.50]%, 0.89 [0.73, 1.09] mm, and 2.89 [2.37, 4.35] mm, respectively. When compared to the best-performing optimized 3D network (i.e., 3D V-Net with a Dice plus cross-entropy loss function), our proposed method performed with a significant improvement across nearly all metrics. A computation time <0.7 s per prostate was observed, which is a sufficiently short segmentation time for intraoperative implementation. Conclusions Our proposed algorithm was able to provide a fast and accurate 3D segmentation across variable 3D TRUS prostate images, enabling a generalizable intraoperative solution for needle-based prostate cancer procedures.
This method has the potential to decrease procedure times, supporting the increasing interest in needle-based 3D TRUS approaches.","3D ultrasound prostate segmentation,biopsy,brachytherapy,deep learning,prostate cancer",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"INTEROBSERVER,VARIABILITY,CONVEX-OPTIMIZATION,VOLUME,MEASUREMENT,TRUS",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.14134,

However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape of these tumors, segmentation of the sub-regions is challenging. Recent developments using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in various semantic and medical image segmentation tasks, many of which are based on the U-Net network structure with symmetric encoding and decoding paths for end-to-end segmentation due to its high efficiency and good performance. In brain tumor segmentation, the 3D nature of multimodal MRI poses challenges such as memory and computation limitations and class imbalance when directly adopting the U-Net structure. In this study we aim to develop a deep learning model using a 3D U-Net with adaptations in the training and testing strategies, network structures, and model parameters for brain tumor segmentation.

Here, we report comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on single crystals of Sr1-xMn1-ySb2, which have been well characterized by magnetization and magnetotransport measurements, both of which demonstrate that the material is a topologically nontrivial semimetal. The INS spectra clearly show a spin gap of similar to 6 meV. The dispersion in the magnetic Mn layer extends up to about 76 meV, while that between the layers has a narrow band width of 6 meV. We find that the linear spin-wave theory using a Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian can reproduce the experimental spectra with the following parameters: a nearest-neighbor (SJ(1) similar to 28.0 meV) and next-nearest-neighbor in-plane exchange interaction (SJ(2) similar to 9.3 meV), interlayer exchange coupling (SJ(c) similar to -0.1 meV), and spin anisotropy constant (SD similar to -0.07 meV). Despite the coexistence of Weyl fermions and magnons, we find no clear evidence that the magnetic dynamics are influenced by the Weyl fermions in Sr1-xMn1-ySb2, possibly because that the Weyl fermions and magnons reside in the Sb and Mn layers separately, and the interlayer coupling is weak due to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the material, as also evident from the small SJ(c) of -0.1 meV.","BERRYS PHASE,ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES,ULTRAHIGH MOBILITY,MAGNETORESISTANCE,DISCOVERY,NODES",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","Materials Science,Physics",,3.86,"BERRYS,PHASE,ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES,ULTRAHIGH,MOBILITY,MAGNETORESISTANCE,DISCOVERY,NODES",PHYSICAL REVIEW B,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03893,

A total of 482 materials were found to meet the 95% CO2 purity and 90% CO2 recovery targets (95/90-PRTs)-365 of which have parasitic energies below that of solvent-based capture (similar to 290 kWh(e)/MT CO2) with a low value of 217 kWh(e)/MT CO2. Machine learning models were developed using common adsorption metrics to predict a material's ability to meet the 95/90-PRT with an overall prediction accuracy of 91%. It was found that accurate parasitic energy and productivity estimates of a VSA process require full process simulations.","METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS,CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE,FLUE-GAS,ADSORBENT,EQUILIBRIUM,SEPARATIONS,NITROGEN,ENERGY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Engineering,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,9.922,"METAL-ORGANIC,FRAMEWORKS,CARBON-DIOXIDE,CAPTURE,FLUE-GAS,ADSORBENT,EQUILIBRIUM,SEPARATIONS,NITROGEN,ENERGY",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,

Our goal is to compare the handcrafted (explicitly designed) and deep learning (DL)-based radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DWIs) for predicting neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (nCRT) response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). 43 Patients receiving nCRT were included. All patients underwent DWIs before nCRT and total mesorectal excision surgery 6-12 weeks after completion of nCRT. Gross tumor volume (GTV) contours were drawn by an experienced radiation oncologist on DWIs. The patient-cohort was split into the responder group (n = 22) and the non-responder group (n = 21) based on the post-nCRT response assessed by postoperative pathology, MRI or colonoscopy. Handcrafted and DL-based features were extracted from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of the DWI using conventional computer-aided diagnosis methods and a pre-trained convolution neural network, respectively. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-logistic regression models were constructed using extracted features for predicting treatment response. The model performance was evaluated with repeated 20 times stratified 4-fold cross-validation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared using the corrected paired t-test. The model built with handcrafted features achieved the mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.64, while the one built with DL-based features yielded the mean AUC of 0.73. The corrected paired t-test on AUC showed P-value < 0.05. DL-based features extracted from pre-treatment DWIs achieved significantly better classification performance compared with handcrafted features for predicting nCRT response in patients with LARC.","deep learning,radiomics,diffusion-weighted MR imaging,locally advanced rectal cancer,treatment response prediction",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04012,

Given a patient anatomy and linear-accelerator IMRT multi-leaf-collimator shape or segment, a novel set of physics-based inputs is calculated that encode the linac machine parameters into the underlying anatomy. These inputs are then used to train a deep convolutional network to derive the dose distribution of individual MLC shapes on a given patient anatomy.
In this work we demonstrate the proof-of-concept application of DeepDose on 101 prostate patients treated in our clinic with fixed-beam IMRT. The ground-truth data used for training, validation and testing of the prediction were calculated with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo dose engine at 1% statistical uncertainty per segment. A deep convolution network was trained using the data of 80 patients at the clinically used 3 mm(3) grid spacing while 10 patients were used for validation.
For another 11 independent test patients, the network was able to accurately estimate the segment doses from the clinical plans of each patient passing the clinical QA when compared with the Monte Carlo calculations, yielding on average 99.9%+/- 0.3% for the forward calculated patient plans at 3%/3 mm gamma tests. Dose prediction using the trained network was very fast at approximately 0.9 seconds for the input generation and 0.6 seconds for single GPU inference per segment and 1 minute per patient in total.
The overall performance of this dose calculation framework in terms of both accuracy and inference speed, makes it compelling for online adaptive workflows where fast segment dose calculations are needed.","dose engine,IMRT,deep learning,AI,treatment planning,plan adaptation,MR-linac",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.554,"PLATFORM,IMPACT",PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab7630,

In this study we investigated the performance of a well-trained DCNN model from a public dataset for thoracic OAR segmentation on a local dataset and explored the systematic differences between the datasets. We observed that a subtle shift of organs inside patient body due to the abdominal compression technique during image acquisition caused significantly worse performance on the local dataset. Furthermore, we developed an optimal strategy via incorporating different numbers of new cases from the local institution and using transfer learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of the trained DCNN model. We found that by adding as few as 10 cases from the local institution, the performance can reach the same level as in the original dataset.

However, segmentation of medical images is challenging due to many image modalities, such as, CT, X-ray, MRI, microscopy among others. An additional challenge to this is the high variability, inconsistent regions with missing edges, absence of texture contrast, and high noise in the background of biomedical images. Thus, many segmentation approaches have been investigated to address these issues and to transform medical images into meaningful information. During the past decade, finite mixture models have been revealed to be one of the most flexible and popular approaches in data clustering. In this article, we propose a statistical framework for online variational learning of finite inverted Beta-Liouville mixture model for clustering medical images. The online variational learning framework is used to estimate the parameters and the number of mixture components simultaneously, thus decreasing the computational complexity of the model. To this end, we evaluated our proposed algorithm on five different biomedical image data sets including optic disc detection and localization in diabetic retinopathy, digital imaging in melanoma lesion detection and segmentation, brain tumor detection, colon cancer detection and computer aid detection (CAD) of Malaria. Furthermore, we compared the proposed algorithm with three other popular algorithms. In our results, we analyze that the proposed online variational learning of finite IBL mixture model algorithm performs accurately on multiple modalities of medical images. It detects the disease patterns with high confidence. Computational and statistical approaches like the one presented in this article hold a significant impact on medical image analysis and interpretation in both clinical applications and scientific research. We believe that the proposed algorithm has the capacity to address multi modal biomedical image data sets and can be further applied by researchers to analyze correct disease patterns.","biomedical images,brain tumor detection,CAD of malaria,colon cancer,diabetic retinopathy,feature extraction,finite inverted Beta-Liouville,image segmentation,mixture model,optic disc localization and detection,skin melanoma",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,2.03,"BRAIN-TUMOR,MIXTURE,DIAGNOSIS,SELECTION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,,

The dental problems can cause cavity and bacterial infection. The dental and speech problems mostly can be related to the Alzheimer disease, and cognitive changes. Therefore, the dental information is collected from patients and analyzed by applying intelligent machine learning techniques. The gathered dental information is normalized by standardized min max approach. Further, different statistical parameters are derived which are huge in dimension. The optimal features are selected using grey wolf optimized approach. The method effectively selects the optimum dental features and the selected features are processed using bacterial optimized associative deep neural network. The network collects the Alzheimer disease features and compare them with the collected dental features to establish the brain related issues with dental features. The efficiency of the system is evaluated using experimental results and discussion. Thus, the introduced intelligent bacterial optimized associative deep neural network recognizes the relationship up to 98.98% of accuracy which is the maximum accuracy compared to other methods.

Although valuable for radiology education, the use of teaching file repositories has been hindered by the ability to perform advanced searches on these repositories given the unstructured format of the data and the sparseness of the different repositories. Our term coverage analysis of two major medical ontologies, Radiology Lexicon (RadLex) and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), and two teaching file repositories, Medical Imaging Resource Community (MIRC) and MyPacs, showed that both ontologies combined cover 56.3% of terms in the MIRC and only 17.9% of terms in MyPacs. Furthermore, the overlap between the two ontologies (i.e., terms included by both the RadLex and UMLS SNOMED CT) was a mere 5.6% for the MIRC and 2% for the RadLex. Clustering the content of the teaching file repositories showed that they focus on different diagnostic areas within radiology. The MIRC teaching file covers mostly pediatric cases; a few cases are female patients with heart-, chest-, and bone-related diseases. The MyPacs contains a range of different diseases with no focus on a particular disease category, gender, or age group. MyPacs also provides a wide variety of cases related to the neck, face, heart, chest, and breast. These findings provide valuable insights on what new cases should be added or how existent cases may be integrated to provide more comprehensive data repositories. Similarly, the low-term coverage by the ontologies shows the need to expand ontologies with new terminology such as new terms learned from these teaching file repositories and validated by experts. While our methodology to organize and index data using clustering approaches and medical ontologies is applied to teaching file repositories, it can be applied to any other medical clinical data.","Cluster analysis,Radiology teaching files,Medical ontologies,Coverage analysis,Data integration",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,RADLEX,JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256159,

Theory and Methods Pooled imaging data from multiple sources are subject to variation between the sources. Correcting for these biases has become very important as imaging studies increase in size and multi-site cases become more common. We propose learning an intermediate representation invariant to site/protocol variables, a technique adapted from information theory-based algorithmic fairness; by leveraging the data processing inequality, such a representation can then be used to create an image reconstruction that is uninformative of its original source, yet still faithful to underlying structures. To implement this, we use a deep learning method based on variational auto-encoders (VAE) to construct scanner invariant encodings of the imaging data. Results To evaluate our method, we use training data from the 2018 MICCAI Computational Diffusion MRI (CDMRI) Challenge Harmonization dataset. Our proposed method shows improvements on independent test data relative to a recently published baseline method on each subtask, mapping data from three different scanning contexts to and from one separate target scanning context. Conclusions As imaging studies continue to grow, the use of pooled multi-site imaging will similarly increase. Invariant representation presents a strong candidate for the harmonization of these data.","diffusion MRI,harmonization,invariant representation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,"BRAIN,ACQUISITION,RELIABILITY",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05375,

Many methods have been developed to identify AF, including both the hand-picked features by experts and the recent emerging artificial intelligent (AI) methods. As the traditional hand-picked features have almost reached the boundary of their capability, the AI methods have shown their great potentials to achieve high accuracy for the AF identification. However, some common AI methods, especially deep learning methods, do not provide good properties of interpretability, making it difficult to explore the internal relationship between input and prediction results. In addition, most of the reported methods are only for the intra-patient test of AF and Non-AF. In this study, we try to develop an AF detector based on a twin-attentional convolutional long short-term memory neural network (TAC-LSTM), which can not only generate results with high accuracy but also enable a human-friendly function to provide the possible explanations of the automated extracted features by AI. TAC-LSTM was applied to extract multi-domain features of ECG signals for AF detection and to mine the influence of different input segments on the final prediction results. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (AFDB) with intra-patient test and inter-patient test and the results also have shown that multi-domain features extracted by TAC-LSTM can provide more useful information.

A minimum amount of water is typically required to dissolve biomass-derived materials, while adding an organic cosolvent can enhance the rates and selectivities of the desirable, catalytic reaction steps. Understanding the molecular-level bases underlying these solvent effects would provide a powerful measure of control over the reaction environment for biomass conversion processes, whereby the rates of desired reaction steps could be preferentially enhanced over the undesirable ones by modulating the composition of the solvent system. However, a quantitative basis to anticipate these solvent effects is currently lacking, and optimizing the composition of the liquid phase for new biomass conversion reactions typically requires laborious screening of the continuous space of possible mixed solvent systems. Herein, we summarize our efforts to estimate solvent effects on the rates and selectivities of liquid-phase, acid-catalyzed biomass conversions reactions using experiments, classical molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning tools. We then synthesize these insights into a workflow that allows for the rational design of mixed solvent systems for acid-catalyzed biomass conversion processes using computationally efficient methods and minimal experiments.

Methods A bone segmentation model was trained on 25 manually annotated 3D MRI volumes to segment the femur, tibia, and patella from 47 078 3D MRI volumes. Each bone segmentation was converted to a 3D point cloud and transformed into spherical coordinates. Different fusion strategies were performed to merge spherical maps obtained by each bone.

Several OA Diagnosis models were tested and the weights for each trained model were transferred to the OA Incidence models. The OA incidence task consisted of predicting OA from a healthy scan within a range of eight time points, from 1 y to 8 y.

In order to develop such methods, especially ones utilizing machine learning approaches, descriptors which encode the structural features of the candidate configurations are required. In this paper, we propose the use of time-dependent electron diffraction simulations to create descriptors for the configurations of surface materials. Our proposal utilizes the fact that the sub-femtosecond time-dependence of electron diffraction patterns are highly sensitive to the arrangement of atoms in the surface region of the material, allowing one to distinguish configurations which possess identical symmetry but differ in the locations of the atoms in the unit cell.

Biopsy - the gold standard - is used only as a last resort due to its invasiveness, high cost, adverse events (e.g., bleeding, infection, etc.), and the time for reporting. To overcome these limitations, a renal computer-assisted diagnostic (Renal-CAD) system was developed to assess kidney transplant function.
Methods The developed Renal-CAD system integrates data collected from two image-based sources and two clinical-based sources to assess renal transplant function. The imaging sources were the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) extracted from 47 diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) scans at 11 different b-values (b0, b50, b100, ..., b1000 s/mm2), and the transverse relaxation rate (R2*) extracted from 30 blood oxygen level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) scans at 5 different echo times (TEs = 2, 7, 12, 17, and 22 ms). Serum creatinine (SCr) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were the clinical sources for kidney function evaluation. The Renal-CAD system initially performed kidney segmentation using the level-set method, followed by estimation of the ADCs from DW-MRIs and the R2* from BOLD-MRIs. ADCs and R2* estimates from 30 subjects that have both types of scans were integrated with their associated SCr and CrCl. The integrated biomarkers were then used as our discriminatory features to train and test a deep learning-based classifier, namely stacked autoencoders (SAEs) to differentiate non-rejection (NR) from acute rejection (AR) renal transplants.
Results Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach along with SAEs, the Renal-CAD system demonstrated 93.3% accuracy, 90.0% sensitivity, and 95.0% specificity in differentiating AR from NR. Robustness of the Renal-CAD system was also confirmed by the area under the curve value of 0.92. Using a stratified tenfold cross-validation approach, the Renal-CAD system demonstrated its reproducibility and robustness by a diagnostic accuracy of 86.7%, sensitivity of 80.0%, specificity of 90.0%, and AUC of 0.88.

When previous CT images are available for the same body region of the patient, the ability to obtain patient-specific organ doses for CT - in a similar manner as radiation therapy treatment planning - will open the door to personalized and prospective CT scan protocols. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of combining deep-learning algorithms for automatic segmentation of multiple radiosensitive organs from CT images with the GPU-based Monte Carlo rapid organ dose calculation.
Methods A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net for organ segmentation is developed and trained to automatically delineate multiple radiosensitive organs from CT images. Two databases are used: The lung CT segmentation challenge 2017 (LCTSC) dataset that contains 60 thoracic CT scan patients, each consisting of five segmented organs, and the Pancreas-CT (PCT) dataset, which contains 43 abdominal CT scan patients each consisting of eight segmented organs. A fivefold cross-validation method is performed on both sets of data. Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) are used to evaluate the segmentation performance against the ground truth. A GPU-based Monte Carlo dose code, ARCHER, is used to calculate patient-specific CT organ doses. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of relative dose errors (RDEs). To demonstrate the potential improvement of the new method, organ dose results are compared against those obtained for population-average patient phantoms used in an off-line dose reporting software, VirtualDose, at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Results The median DSCs are found to be 0.97 (right lung), 0.96 (left lung), 0.92 (heart), 0.86 (spinal cord), 0.76 (esophagus) for the LCTSC dataset, along with 0.96 (spleen), 0.96 (liver), 0.95 (left kidney), 0.90 (stomach), 0.87 (gall bladder), 0.80 (pancreas), 0.75 (esophagus), and 0.61 (duodenum) for the PCT dataset. Comparing with organ dose results from population-averaged phantoms, the new patient-specific method achieved smaller absolute RDEs (mean +/- standard deviation) for all organs: 1.8% +/- 1.4% (vs 16.0% +/- 11.8%) for the lung, 0.8% +/- 0.7% (vs 34.0% +/- 31.1%) for the heart, 1.6% +/- 1.7% (vs 45.7% +/- 29.3%) for the esophagus, 0.6% +/- 1.2% (vs 15.8% +/- 12.7%) for the spleen, 1.2% +/- 1.0% (vs 18.1% +/- 15.7%) for the pancreas, 0.9% +/- 0.6% (vs 20.0% +/- 15.2%) for the left kidney, 1.7% +/- 3.1% (vs 19.1% +/- 9.8%) for the gallbladder, 0.3% +/- 0.3% (vs 24.2% +/- 18.7%) for the liver, and 1.6% +/- 1.7% (vs 19.3% +/- 13.6%) for the stomach.

J.,Wang Tonghe,Wang Hesheng,Jani Ashesh B.,Curran Walter J.,Patel Pretesh,Liu Tian,Yang Xiaofeng","Zhang YP,Lei Y,Qiu RLJ,Wang TH,Wang HS,Jani AB,Curran WJ,Patel P,Liu T,Yang XF",Zhang YP,10.1002/mp.14128,Emory University,"Purpose Ultrasound (US)-guided high dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy requests the clinicians to place HDR needles (catheters) into the prostate gland under transrectal US (TRUS) guidance in the operating room. The quality of the subsequent radiation treatment plan is largely dictated by the needle placements, which varies upon the experience level of the clinicians and the procedure protocols. Real-time plan dose distribution, if available, could be a vital tool to provide more subjective assessment of the needle placements, hence potentially improving the radiation plan quality and the treatment outcome. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in US imaging, real-time multi-needle segmentation in 3D TRUS, which is the major obstacle for real-time dose mapping, has not been realized to date. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method that enables accurate and real-time digitization of the multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy.
Methods A deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture was developed to segment multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images. Attention gates were considered in our model to improve the prediction on the small needle points. Furthermore, the spatial continuity of needles was encoded into our model with total variation (TV) regularization. The combined network was trained on 3D TRUS patches with the deep supervision strategy, where the binary needle annotation images were provided as ground truth. The trained network was then used to localize and segment the HDR needles for a new patient's TRUS images. We evaluated our proposed method based on the needle shaft and tip errors against manually defined ground truth and compared our method with other state-of-art methods (U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net).
Results Our method detected 96% needles of 339 needles from 23 HDR prostate brachytherapy patients with 0.290 +/- 0.236 mm at shaft error and 0.442 +/- 0.831 mm at tip error. For shaft localization, our method resulted in 96% localizations with less than 0.8 mm error (needle diameter is 1.67 mm), while for tip localization, our method resulted in 75% needles with 0 mm error and 21% needles with 2 mm error (TRUS image slice thickness is 2 mm). No significant difference is observed (P = 0.83) on tip localization between our results with the ground truth. Compared with U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net, the proposed method delivers a significant improvement on both shaft error and tip error (P < 0.05).
Conclusions We proposed a new segmentation method to precisely localize the tips and shafts of multiple needles in 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy. The 3D rendering of the needles could help clinicians to evaluate the needle placements. It paves the way for the development of real-time plan dose assessment tools that can further elevate the quality and outcome of HDR prostate brachytherapy.","deep learning,multi-needle localization,prostate brachytherapy,total variation regularization,ultrasound images",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"ULTRASOUND,RATIONALE,TRACKING,RANSAC",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7759387,

However, imaging MS data is polluted with off-sample ions caused by sample preparation, particularly by the MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) matrix application. Off-sample ion images confound and hinder statistical analysis, metabolite identification and downstream analysis with no automated solutions available. Results We developed an artificial intelligence approach to recognize off-sample ion images. First, we created a high-quality gold standard of 23,238 expert-tagged ion images from 87 public datasets from the METASPACE knowledge base.

Thus, use of stochastic methods for producing plausible realizations of materials' morphology based on one or very few images has become an increasingly common practice in their modeling. The accuracy of the realizations is often evaluated using two-point microstructural descriptors or physics-based modeling of certain phenomena in the materials, such as transport processes or fluid flow. In many cases, however, two-point correlation functions do not provide accurate evaluation of the realizations, as they are usually unable to distinguish between high- and low-quality reconstructed models. Calculating flow and transport properties of the realization is an accurate way of checking the quality of the realizations, but it is computationally expensive. In this paper a method based on machine learning is proposed for evaluating stochastic approaches for reconstruction of materials, which is applicable to any of such methods. The method reduces the dimensionality of the realizations using an unsupervised deep-learning algorithm by compressing images and realizations of materials. Two criteria for evaluating the accuracy of a reconstruction algorithm are then introduced. One, referred to as the internal uncertainty space, is based on the recognition that for a reconstruction method to be effective, the differences between the realizations that it produces must be reasonably wide, so that they faithfully represent all the possible spatial variations in the materials' microstructure. The second criterion recognizes that the realizations must be close to the original I and, thus, it quantifies the similarity based on an external uncertainty space. Finally, the ratio of two uncertainty indices associated with the two criteria is considered as the final score of the accuracy of a stochastic algorithm, which provides a quantitative basis for comparing various realizations and the approaches that produce them. The proposed method is tested with images of three types of heterogeneous materials in order to evaluate four stochastic reconstruction algorithms.","CONDITIONAL SIMULATION,POROUS-MEDIA,MICROSTRUCTURE,COALESCENCE,TOMOGRAPHY,EVOLUTION,TRANSPORT,POROSITY,GROWTH",Article,"AMER PHYSICAL SOC, ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",Physics,,2.414,"CONDITIONAL,SIMULATION,POROUS-MEDIA,MICROSTRUCTURE,COALESCENCE,TOMOGRAPHY,EVOLUTION,TRANSPORT,POROSITY,GROWTH",PHYSICAL REVIEW E,,

A major short-term decision in a mining complex is to determine the flow of materials that first includes deciding which handling facilities to send the extracted materials and then determining how to utilize the processing facilities. The flow of materials through the mining complex is significantly dependent on the performance of and interaction between its different components. New digital technologies, including the development of advanced sensors and monitoring devices, have enabled a mining complex to acquire new information about the performance of its different components.

While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients' mobile usage patterns.
Materials and Methods: 412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory-2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score >= 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified.
Results: Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants' age and gender were included.
Discussions/Conclusion: The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments. Moreover, the input variables used in this study were aggregated mobile usage metadata attributes, which has low privacy sensitivity making it more likely for patients to grant required application permissions.","depression,mobile usage,mobile health,machine learning",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,5.178,"PSYCHOMETRIC,PROPERTIES,INVENTORY-II,BDI-II,VALIDITY,DEVICES,ADULTS",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647279,

New domain adaptation and transfer learning methods can potentially address this issue.
Objective: We examine neural unsupervised domain adaptation methods, introducing a novel combination of domain adaptation with transformer-based transfer learning methods to improve negation detection. We also want to better understand the interaction between the widely used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) system and domain adaptation methods.
Materials and Methods: We use 4 clinical text datasets that are annotated with negation status. We evaluate a neural unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm and BERT, a transformer-based model that is pretrained on massive general text datasets. We develop an extension to BERT that uses domain adversarial training, a neural domain adaptation method that adds an objective to the negation task, that the classifier should not be able to distinguish between instances from 2 different domains.
Results: The domain adaptation methods we describe show positive results, but, on average, the best performance is obtained by plain BERT (without the extension). We provide evidence that the gains from BERT are likely not additive with the gains from domain adaptation.
Discussion: Our results suggest that, at least for the task of clinical negation detection, BERT subsumes domain adaptation, implying that BERT is already learning very general representations of negation phenomena such that fine-tuning even on a specific corpus does not lead to much overfitting.

The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association.
Results: The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P<.001), between physician understanding and trust (P<.001), and between explainability and trust (P<.001). ML outputs that used modelagnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular ML explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior.
Conclusions: Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in ML risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred ML outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior.","artificial intelligence,explainability,interpretability,decision support,medicine",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,5.178,"ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,PULMONARY-EMBOLISM,MODEL,CLASSIFICATION,ACCEPTANCE,PREDICTION,EMERGENCY",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647292,

The knowledge of the relation between brine composition and concentration for a given oil may lead to the ionic tuning of the injected solution on geochemical and enhanced oil recovery processes. Thus, it is worth examining the parameters influencing the interfacial properties. In this context, we have combined machine learning (ML) techniques with classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to predict oil/brine interfacial tensions (IFT) effectively and compared this process to a linear regression (LR) method. To diversify our data set, we have introduced a new atomistic crude oil model (medium) with 36 different types of hydrocarbon molecules. The MD simulations were performed for mono- and multicomponent (toluene, heptane, Heptol, light, and medium) oil systems interfaced with sulfate and chloride brines with varying cations (Na2+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) and salinity concentration. Thus, a consistent IFT data set was built for the ML training and LR fitting at room temperature and pressure conditions, over the feature space considering oil density, oil composition, salinity, and ionic concentrations. On the basis of gradient boosted (GB) algorithms, we have observed that the dominant quantities affecting the IFT are related to the oil attributes and the salinity concentration, and no specific ion dominates the IFT changes. When the obtained LR model was validated against MD and experimental data from the literature, the error varied up to 2% and 9%, respectively, showing a robust and consistent transferability. The combination of MD simulations and ML techniques may provide a fast and cost-effective IFT determination over multiple and complex fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces.","machine learning,molecular dynamics simulations,oil/brine interface,medium oil model,linear regression model,feature importance analysis",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"FORCE-FIELD,SIMULATIONS,SALINITY,RECOVERY,TEMPERATURE,SYSTEMS,NACL",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,,

During drying process, the moisture content changed dramatically with notable migration and conversion of different water phases. Partial least squares (PLS), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) models were applied to develop quantitative models. Among all, BPNN model showed considerably better performance of prediction with coefficient of determination R(2)c = 0.9829, R(2)p = 0.9639.

A gait-based age and gender estimation challenge was launched in the 12th IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), 2019. In this competition, 18 teams initially registered from 14 countries. The goal of this challenge was to find some smart approaches to deal with age and gender estimation from sensor-based gait data. For this purpose, we employed a large wearable sensor-based gait dataset, which has 745 subjects (357 females and 388 males), from 2 to 78 years old in the training dataset; and 58 subjects (19 females and 39 males) in the test dataset. It has several walking patterns. The gait data sequences were collected from three IMUZ sensors, which were placed on waist-belt or at the top of a backpack. There were 67 solutions from ten teams-for age and gender estimation. This paper extensively analyzes the methods and achieved-results from various approaches.

Faults on critical components, such as large pumping systems, can lead to material damage and opportunity losses. Pumps plays an essential role in various industries and as such clever maintenance can ensure cost reductions and high availability. Prognostics and Health Management, PHM, is the study utilizing data to estimate the current and future conditions of a system. Within the field of PHM, Predictive Maintenance, PdM, has been gaining increased attention. Data-driven models can be built to estimate the remaining-useful-lifetime of complex systems that would be difficult to identify by man. With the increased attention that the Predictive Maintenance field is receiving, review papers become increasingly important to understand what research has been conducted and what challenges need to be addressed. This paper does so by initially conceptualising the PdM field. A structured overview of literature in regard to application within PdM is presented, before delving into the domain of thermal power plants and pump systems. Finally, related challenges and trends will be outlined. This paper finds that a large number of experimental data-driven models have been successfully deployed, but the PdM field would benefit from more industrial case studies. Furthermore, investigations into the scale-ability of models would benefit industries that are looking into large-scale implementations. Here, examining a method for automatic maintenance of the developed model will be of interest.

FHB is a short cycle disease and is highly destructive under conducive environments. To provide technical support for the rapid detection of the FHB disease, we proposed to develop a new Fusarium disease index (FDI) based on the spectral data of 374-1050 nm. This study was conducted through the analysis of reflectance spectral data of healthy and diseased wheat ears at the flowering and filling stages by hyperspectral imaging technology and the random forest method. The characteristic wavelengths selected were 570 nm and 678 nm for the late flowering stage, 565 nm and 661 nm for the early filling stage, 560 nm and 663 nm for the combined stage (combining both flowering and filling stages) by random forest. FDI at each stage was derived from the wavebands of each corresponding stage. Compared with other 16 existing spectral indices, FDI demonstrated a stronger ability to determine the severity of the FHB disease. Its determination coefficients (R-2) values exceeded 0.90 and the RMSEs were less than 0.08 in the models for each stage. Furthermore, the model for the combined stage performed better when used at single growth stage, but its effect was weaker than that of the models for the two individual growth stages. Therefore, using FDI can provide a new tool to detect the FHB disease at different growth stages in wheat.","hyperspectral imaging,spectral indices,random forest,growth stage,Fusarium head blight",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"REFLECTANCE,INDEXES,CHLOROPHYLL,CONTENT,VEGETATION,INDEXES,CANOPY,LEAF,GREEN,PREDICTION,LEAVES",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7219049?pdf=render,

Improvements in both therapeutic and follow-up strategies are urgently needed. In previous work we described an oscillatory pattern of response to Temozolomide (TMZ) using a standard administration protocol, detected through MRSI-based machine learning approaches. In the present work, we have introduced the Immune-Enhancing Metronomic Schedule (IMS) with an every 6-d TMZ administration at 60 mg/kg and investigated the consistence of such oscillatory behaviour. A total of n = 17 GL261 GB tumour-bearing C57BL/6j mice were studied with MRI/MRSI every 2 d, and the oscillatory behaviour (6.2 +/- 1.5 d period from the TMZ administration day) was confirmed during response. Furthermore, IMS-TMZ produced significant improvement in mice survival (22.5 +/- 3.0 d for controls vs 135.8 +/- 78.2 for TMZ-treated), outperforming standard TMZ treatment. Histopathological correlation was investigated in selected tumour samples (n = 6) analyzing control and responding fields. Significant differences were found for CD3+ cells (lymphocytes, 3.3 +/- 2.5 vs 4.8 +/- 2.9, respectively) and Iba-1 immunostained area (microglia/macrophages, 16.8% +/- 9.7% and 21.9% +/- 11.4%, respectively). Unexpectedly, during IMS-TMZ treatment, tumours from some mice (n = 6) fully regressed and remained undetectable without further treatment for 1 mo. These animals were considered ""cured"" and a GL261 re-challenge experiment performed, with no tumour reappearance in five out of six cases. Heterogeneous therapy response outcomes were detected in tumour-bearing mice, and a selected group was investigated (n = 3 non-responders, n = 6 relapsing tumours, n = 3 controls). PD-L1 content was found ca. 3-fold increased in the relapsing group when comparing with control and non-responding groups, suggesting that increased lymphocyte inhibition could be associated to IMS-TMZ failure. Overall, data suggest that host immune response has a relevant role in therapy response/escape in GL261 tumours under IMS-TMZ therapy. This is associated to changes in the metabolomics pattern, oscillating every 6 d, in agreement with immune cycle length, which is being sampled by MRSI-derived nosological images.","glioma,immune memory,TMZ,immune response,metronomic therapy,orthotopic tumours,PD-L1",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Biophysics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Spectroscopy",,3.988,"RANDOMIZED,PHASE-III,MOUSE,GLIOMA,BRAIN-TUMORS,CANCER,PERTURBATION,PATTERN,PD-L1,EXPRESSION,SURVIVAL,MODEL",NMR IN BIOMEDICINE,https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/11715/7/Anti-tumour%20immune%20response%20in%20GL261%20glioblastoma%20generated%20by%20Temozolomide%20Immune-Enhancing%20Metronomic%20Schedule%20monitored%20with%20MRSI-based%20nosological%20images.pdf,

The aim is to achieve an effective solution by using real-time compression, efficient signal processing, and data transmission. The system utilizes level-crossing-based ECG signal sampling, adaptive-rate denoising, and wavelet-based sub-band decomposition. Statistical features are extracted from the sub-bands and used for automated arrhythmia classification. The performance of the system was studied by using five classes of arrhythmia, obtained from the MIT-BIH dataset. Experimental results showed a three-fold decrease in the number of collected samples compared to conventional counterparts. This resulted in a significant reduction of the computational cost of the post denoising, features extraction, and classification. Moreover, a seven-fold reduction was achieved in the amount of data that needed to be transmitted to the cloud. This resulted in a notable reduction in the transmitter power consumption, bandwidth usage, and cloud application processing load.

Motion blur has been reported to reduce lesion detection performance and mask small abnormalities, resulting in failure to detect them until they reach more advanced stages. Automatic detection of blur could support the clinical decision-making process during the mammography exam by allowing for an immediate retake, thereby preventing unnecessary expense, time, and patient anxiety.
Methods: Blur was simulated mathematically to mimic the real blur seen in clinical practice. The blur point-spread-function (PSF) mask is generated by distributing pixel intensity of an image pixel moving under random motion within the range of blur effect (the maximum amount of tissue motion allowed). The random motion trajectory vector is generated on a super-sampled image frame to accommodate smaller substeps; the vector was then sampled on a regular pixel grid using subpixel linear interpolation to generate the blur PSF mask. This randomly generated motion trajectory is constrained by several factors: the effects of variations in tissue elasticity, imaging exposure time, and size of blur effect (motion boundary in millimeters) were examined. The blur mask is convolved with a mammogram to create blur. Five motion blur magnitudes (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm) were simulated on 244 and 434 mammograms from the INbreast and DDSM databases, respectively. Blur was quantified using nine BM operators for each mammogram and at each blur level. The mammograms were assigned to training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets to train three machine-learning classifiers: Ensemble Bagged Trees, fine Gaussian SVM, and weighted KNN, to distinguish five levels of blurred from unblurred mammograms, using six-way classification.
Results: For the INbreast mammograms, the average classification accuracies were 87.7%, 85.7%, and 85.7% for Ensemble Bagged Trees, fine Gaussian SVM, and weighted KNN, respectively, and the average classification accuracies for DDSM were 93.5%, 93.6%, and 92.7% for Ensemble Bagged Trees, fine Gaussian SVM, and weighted KNN, respectively.
Conclusions: Preliminary results show the potential to detect simulated blur automatically using those methods. Although limited work has been done to quantify the effects of motion blur on radiologists' performance, there is evidence that motion blur might not be detected visually by a human observer and could negatively affect radiologists' lesion detection performance. As of this date, no other study has investigated the ability of machine-learning classifiers and BM operators to detect motion blur in mammograms.

Material phases are identified by machine learning on hyperspectral data from electron spectroscopic imaging. We observe a specific polymorph of ITIC after thermal annealing. During annealing, enhanced by the presence of additives, PBDB-T acts as nucleation site for ITIC due to strong pi-pi-interactions of the electron withdrawing groups of both molecules.

Methods: Magnetic resonance images and CT scans of human and canine pelvic regions were acquired and paired using nonrigid registration. Magnitude MR images and Dixon reconstructed water, fat, in-phase and opposed-phase images were obtained from a single T1-weighted multi-echo gradient-echo acquisition. From this set, 6 input configurations were defined, each containing 1 to 4 MR images regarded as input channels. For each configuration, a UNet-derived deep learning model was trained for synthetic CT generation. Reconstructed Hounsfield unit maps were evaluated with peak SNR, mean absolute error, and mean error. Dice similarity coefficient and surface distance maps assessed the geometric fidelity of bones. Repeatability was estimated by replicating the training up to 10 times.
Results: Seventeen canines and 23 human subjects were included in the study. Performance and repeatability of single-channel models were dependent on the TE-related water-fat interference with variations of up to 17% in mean absolute error, and variations of up to 28% specifically in bones. Repeatability, Dice similarity coefficient, and mean absolute error were statistically significantly better in multichannel models with mean absolute error ranging from 33 to 40 Hounsfield units in humans and from 35 to 47 Hounsfield units in canines.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN) were employed for classification. Precision, recall, F1 score, as well as a discussion based on statistical analysis, were shown. The paper also contains code utilized in preprocessing and the main part of experiments.","electroencephalography (EEG),brain-computer interface (BCI),feature extraction,automatic classification,deep learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"INDEPENDENT,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,EEG,SIGNAL,CLASSIFICATION,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,STATISTICAL,COMPARISONS,NEURAL-NETWORKS,CLASSIFIERS,DYNAMICS,MODEL",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/8/2403/pdf,
99,NeuroVAD: Real-Time Voice Activity Detection from Non-Invasive Neuromagnetic Signals,20,8,,"Dash Debadatta,Ferrari Paul,Dutta Satwik,Wang Jun","Dash D,Ferrari P,Dutta S,Wang J",Wang J,10.3390/s20082248,University of Texas System,"Neural speech decoding-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) or speech-BCI is a novel paradigm for exploring communication restoration for locked-in (fully paralyzed but aware) patients. Speech-BCIs aim to map a direct transformation from neural signals to text or speech, which has the potential for a higher communication rate than the current BCIs. Although recent progress has demonstrated the potential of speech-BCIs from either invasive or non-invasive neural signals, the majority of the systems developed so far still assume knowing the onset and offset of the speech utterances within the continuous neural recordings. This lack of real-time voice/speech activity detection (VAD) is a current obstacle for future applications of neural speech decoding wherein BCI users can have a continuous conversation with other speakers. To address this issue, in this study, we attempted to automatically detect the voice/speech activity directly from the neural signals recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). First, we classified the whole segments of pre-speech, speech, and post-speech in the neural signals using a support vector machine (SVM). Second, for continuous prediction, we used a long short-term memory-recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) to efficiently decode the voice activity at each time point via its sequential pattern-learning mechanism. Experimental results demonstrated the possibility of real-time VAD directly from the non-invasive neural signals with about 88% accuracy.","brain-computer interface,MEG,wavelet,LSTM-RNN,SVM,VAD,speech-BCI",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"SPEECH,BRAIN,MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY,TASKS",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7218843?pdf=render,
100,Semantic Segmentation of Natural Materials on a Point Cloud Using Spatial and Multispectral Features,20,8,,"Jurado J. M.,Cardenas J. L.,Ogayar C. J.,Ortega L.,Feito F. R.","Jurado JM,Cardenas JL,Ogayar CJ,Ortega L,Feito FR",Jurado JM,10.3390/s20082244,Universidad de Jaen,"The characterization of natural spaces by the precise observation of their material properties is highly demanded in remote sensing and computer vision. The production of novel sensors enables the collection of heterogeneous data to get a comprehensive knowledge of the living and non-living entities in the ecosystem. The high resolution of consumer-grade RGB cameras is frequently used for the geometric reconstruction of many types of environments. Nevertheless, the understanding of natural spaces is still challenging. The automatic segmentation of homogeneous materials in nature is a complex task because there are many overlapping structures and an indirect illumination, so the object recognition is difficult. In this paper, we propose a method based on fusing spatial and multispectral characteristics for the unsupervised classification of natural materials in a point cloud. A high-resolution camera and a multispectral sensor are mounted on a custom camera rig in order to simultaneously capture RGB and multispectral images. Our method is tested in a controlled scenario, where different natural objects coexist. Initially, the input RGB images are processed to generate a point cloud by applying the structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithm. Then, the multispectral images are mapped on the three-dimensional model to characterize the geometry with the reflectance captured from four narrow bands (green, red, red-edge and near-infrared). The reflectance, the visible colour and the spatial component are combined to extract key differences among all existing materials. For this purpose, a hierarchical cluster analysis is applied to pool the point cloud and identify the feature pattern for every material. As a result, the tree trunk, the leaves, different species of low plants, the ground and rocks can be clearly recognized in the scene. These results demonstrate the feasibility to perform a semantic segmentation by considering multispectral and spatial features with an unknown number of clusters to be detected on the point cloud. Moreover, our solution is compared to other method based on supervised learning in order to test the improvement of the proposed approach.","multispectral imaging,heterogeneous data fusion,point cloud segmentation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"EXTRACTION,IMAGERY",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/8/2244/pdf,
