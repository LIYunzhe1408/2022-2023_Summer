1,"Machine learning aided first-principles studies of structure stability of Co-3(Al, X) doped with transition metal elements",200,,,"Guo Jing,Xiao Bin,Li Yihang,Zhai Dong,Tang Yuchao,Du Wan,Liu Yi","Guo J,Xiao B,Li YH,Zhai D,Tang YC,Du W,Liu Y",Liu Y,10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110787,Shanghai University,"To understand the alloying effects on the stability of Co3Al precipitate phase in Co-based superalloy, the energetic stability and structure of ternary alloy Co-3(Al, X) doped with the thirty 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal (TM) elements were studied in this work using first-principles (FP) computation and machine learning (ML) methods. Our FP computation indicated that Hf, Ta, and Ti doping were thermodynamically most stable. Based on the FP computation data, the ML models with three types of chemical composition (CC) and Center-Environment (CE) features, were developed to predict the formation energies and lattice constants of Co-3(Al, X) (X = 3d, 4d, and 5d TM elements). The results show that these ML models all had good prediction accuracy with averaged mean absolute errors (<MAE>) similar to 0.02 eV/atom for formation energies and -0.01 angstrom for lattice constants. Then, the effects of important features were discussed on the energy and geometry properties. To study the alloying effects on the stability of Co-3(Al, W) precipitate phase, the ML models of Co-3(Al, X) were found to be equally accurate to predict the untrained structures of Co-3(Al, WX3) where X = 3d, 4d, and 5d TM elements excluding Co and W. We found that the Co-3(Al, WX3) structures became most stable when X are IVB and VB group TM elements. This work show that machine learning methods can efficiently extend the capabilities of first-principles predictions on the structure stabilities in multi-component alloy design.","First-principles calculations,Center-Environment feature model,Co-based superalloys,Co-3(Al, W)",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.222,"CO-AL-W,HIGH-STRENGTH,BASE,SUPERALLOYS,DESIGN,TA,MO,TI",COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,,
2,Accelerated discovery of single-phase refractory high entropy alloys assisted by machine learning,199,,,"Yan Yonggang,Lu Dan,Wang Kun","Yan YG,Lu D,Wang K",Wang K,10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110723,State University of New York (SUNY) System,"Herein, we proposed a strategy to design single-phase refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) with the assistance of machine learning algorithms. Based on an extensive dataset (1807 entries) built in this work, we applied multiple machine learning algorithms to train the dataset. After the blind test, we found that the Gradient boosting (GB) model can distinguish the single-phase-solid solution and non-single-phase-solid solution alloys with a test accuracy of 96.41%. Given the GB model, we predicted over 100 equiatomic oxidation-resistance RHEAs from the composition space of eight metallic elements. After that, we synthesized ten of these predicted single-phase RHEAs by mechanical alloying. The XRD patterns show that all of them are single-phase BCC solid solution. The experimental results agree well with the prediction results, indicating the excellent performance of the machine learning model in single-phase RHEAs prediction. With the aid of the machine learning method, single-phase oxidation-resistant RHEAs were successfully designed. Our work presents a novel strategy with outstanding performance and evident effectiveness on the accelerated discovery of novel metallic materials used for extreme environments.","Refractor y h i g h entropy alloys,Experimental validation",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.222,"TEMPERATURE,OXIDATION,BEHAVIOR,SOLID-SOLUTION,PHASE,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,HIGH-STRENGTH,DESIGN,MICROSTRUCTURE,RESISTANCE,THERMODYNAMICS,EXPLORATION,SUPERALLOY",COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,,
3,Automatic Identification and Quantitative Characterization of Primary Dendrite Microstructure Based on Machine Learning,11,9,,"Wan Weihao,Li Dongling,Wang Haizhou,Zhao Lei,Shen Xuejing,Sun Dandan,Chen Jingyang,Xiao Chengbo","Wan WH,Li DL,Wang HZ,Zhao L,Shen XJ,Sun DD,Chen JY,Xiao CB",Wang HZ,10.3390/cryst11091060,Central Iron & Steel Research Institute,"Dendrites are important microstructures in single-crystal superalloys. The distribution of dendrites is closely related to the heat treatment process and mechanical properties of single-crystal superalloys. The primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) is an important length scale to describe the distribution of dendrites. In this work, the second-generation single crystal superalloy HT901 with a diameter of 15 mm was imaged under a metallurgical microscope. An automatic dendrite core identification and full-field quantitative statistical analysis method is proposed to automatically detect the dendrite core and calculate the local PDAS. The Faster R-CNN algorithm combined with test time augmentation (TTA) technology is used to automatically identify the dendrite cores. The local multi-directional algorithm combined with Voronoi tessellation is used to determine the local nearest neighbor dendrite and calculate the local PDAS and coordination number. The accuracy of using Faster R-CNN combined with TTA to detect the dendrite core of HT901 reaches 98.4%, which is 15.9% higher than using Faster R-CNN alone. The algorithm calculates the local PDAS of all dendrites in H901 and captures the Gaussian distribution of the local PDAS. The average PDAS determined by the Gaussian distribution is 415 mu m, which is only a small difference from the average spacing lambda over bar (420 mu m) calculated by the traditional method. The technology analyzes the relationship between the local PDAS and the distance from the center of the sample. The local PDAS near the center of HT901 are larger than those near the edge. The results suggests that the method enables the rapid, accurate and quantitative dendritic distribution characterization.","TTA Faster R-CNN,PDAS,local multi-direction,Voronoi tessellation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Crystallography,Materials Science",,2.615,"DIRECTIONAL-SOLIDIFICATION,SPACINGS",CRYSTALS,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/11/9/1060/pdf,
