1,Using convolutional neural networks to identify patient safety incident reports by type and severity,26,12,1600-1608,"Wang Ying,Coiera Enrico,Magrabi Farah","Wang Y,Coiera E,Magrabi F",Wang Y,10.1093/jamia/ocz146,Macquarie University,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with word embedding to identify the type and severity of patient safety incident reports.
Materials and Methods: A CNN with word embedding was applied to identify 10 incident types and 4 severity levels. Model training and validation used data sets (n_type = 2860, n_severity = 1160) collected from a state-wide incident reporting system. Generalizability was evaluated using an independent hospital-level reporting system. CNN architectures were examined by varying layer size and hyperparameters. Performance was evaluated by F score, precision, recall, and compared to binary support vector machine (SVM) ensembles on 3 testing data sets (type/severity: n_benchmark = 286/116, n_original = 444/4837, n_independent = 6000/5950).
Results: A CNN with 6 layers was the most effective architecture, outperforming SVMs with better generalizability to identify incidents by type and severity. The CNN achieved high F scores (> 85%) across all test data sets when identifying common incident types including falls, medications, pressure injury, and aggression. When identifying common severity levels (medium/low), CNN outperformed SVMs, improving F scores by 11.9%-45.1% across all 3 test data sets.
Discussion: Automated identification of incident reports using machine learning is challenging because of a lack of large labelled training data sets and the unbalanced distribution of incident classes. The standard classification strategy is to build multiple binary classifiers and pool their predictions. CNNs can extract hierarchical features and assist in addressing class imbalance, which may explain their success in identifying incident report types.
Conclusion: A CNN with word embedding was effective in identifying incidents by type and severity, providing better generalizability than SVMs.","neural networks,word embedding,multiple classification,text classification,clinical incident reports,patient safety",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Computer Science,Health Care Sciences & Services,Information Science & Library Science,Medical Informatics",,,"MEDICAL-RECORDS,CLASSIFICATION,INFORMATION,QUALITY,CNN",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647259,

However, little attention has been paid to the physical environment where learning takes place. The present study takes a step to address this gap by studying the impact of the presence of others during learning on cognitive load. In a between-subject design, participants (N = 115) were randomly arranged in groups of different group sizes to study computer-based multimedia materials (group size range: 1-13, continuous variable). Further, participants' working memory capacity, topic interest, and their prior knowledge were measured to reveal relevant learner characteristics. Dependent variables were learning performance, perceived task difficulty (mental load), and invested mental effort. We tested the predictions from cognitive load theory with alternative path models to identify the best model fit. Our results show that group size predicted learners' perceived task difficulty: the larger the group of co-actors in the learning situation was, the higher the perceived task difficulty. Moreover, higher topic interest led to lower perceived task difficulty, and more mental effort, although that effect became non-significant after multiple testing adjustment. Perceived task difficulty mediated the effect of group size and topic interest on mental effort.","WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY,SOCIAL FACILITATION,PERFORMANCE,DESIGN,ATTENTION,MODEL,FIT",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",Psychology,,8.302,"WORKING-MEMORY,CAPACITY,SOCIAL,FACILITATION,PERFORMANCE,DESIGN,ATTENTION,MODEL,FIT",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,,

It has been popularly used in both medical and industrial x-ray imaging applications. DTS provides the tomographic benefits of computed tomography with reduced dose and time. However, conventional DTS reconstruction based on the computationally cheap filtered back-projection (FBP) method typically produces poor image quality due to limited angular samplings. To overcome these difficulties, iterative reconstruction methods are often used in DTS reconstruction as they have the potential to provide multiplanar images of higher quality than conventional FBP-based methods. However, they require enormous computational cost in the iterative process, which remains an obstacle to practical applications. In this study, we propose a method for effectively reducing limitedangle artifacts in conventional FBP reconstruction, using a state-of-the-art deep learning scheme with a convolutional neural network. Our results indicate that the proposed DTS reconstruction method effectively minimized limited-angle artifacts, thus improving image performance in DTS, and that further it provided good image quality in both sagittal and coronal views (as in computed tomography) as well as in axial view.","Computerized Tomography (CT) and Computed Radiography (CR),Medical-image reconstruction methods and algorithms , computer-aided software",Article; Proceedings Paper,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Instruments & Instrumentation,,1.328,"CT,RECONSTRUCTION",JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION,,

Damage characterization in cellular materials is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying and registering cracks from the complicated 3D network structure. In this paper, we develop a pipeline of computer vision algorithms to extract crack patterns from a large volumetric dataset of in situ X-ray tomography measurement obtained during a compression test. Based on a hybrid approach using both model-based feature filtering and data-driven machine learning, the proposed method shows high efficiency and accuracy in identifying the crack pattern from the complex cellular structures and tomography reconstruction artifacts. The identified cracks are registered as 3D tilted planes, where 3D morphology descriptors including crack location, crack opening width, and crack plane orientation are registered to provide quantitative data for future mechanical analysis. This method is applied to two different biological materials with different levels of porosity, i.e., sea urchin (Heterocentrotus mamillatus) spines and emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) eggshells.

They allow to deal with quantum transport phenomena and are an advanced tool for constructing novel quantum algorithms. Quantum walks on graphs are fundamentally different from classical random walks analogs, in particular, they walk faster than classical ones on certain graphs, enabling in these cases quantum algorithmic applications and quantum-enhanced energy transfer. However, little is known about the possible advantages on arbitrary graphs not having explicit symmetries. For these graphs one would need to perform simulations of classical and quantum walk dynamics to check if the speedup occurs, which could take a long computational time. Here we present a new approach for the solution of the quantum speedup problem, which is based on a machine learning algorithm that predicts the quantum advantage by just 'looking' at a graph. The convolutional neural network, which we designed specifically to learn from graphs, observes simulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum advantage, allowing to identify graphs that exhibit quantum advantage without performing any quantum walk or random walk simulations. The performance of our approach is evaluated for line and random graphs, where classification was always better than random guess even for the most challenging cases. Our findings pave the way to an automated elaboration of novel large-scale quantum circuits utilizing quantum walk based algorithms, and to simulating high-efficiency energy transfer in biophotonics and material science.","quantum walks,machine learning,convolutional neural networks,quantum transport,quantum speedup",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Physics,,3.741,"ALGORITHM,SEARCH,TIME",NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10632,

The changes in the tongue indicate the changes of the human state. One of the features of the tongue, which can be used to inspect the blood circulation of human, is the shape information of the sublingual vein. Therefore, this paper aims to segment the sublingual vein from the RGB images of the tongue. In traditional segmentation network training based on deep learning, the resolution of the input image is generally resized to save training costs. However, the size of the sublingual vein is much smaller than the size of the tongue relative to the entire image. The resized inputs are likely to cause the network to fail to capture target information for the smaller segmentation and produce an ""all black"" output. This study first pointed out that the training of the segmentation of the sublingual vein compared to the tongue segmentation is much more difficult through a small dataset. At the same time, we also compared the effects of different input sizes on small sublingual segmentation. In response to the problems that arise, we propose a synergistic attention network. By dismembering the entire encoder decoder framework and updating the parameters synergistically, the proposed network can not only improve the convergence speed of training process, but also avoid the problem of falling into the optimal local solution and maintains the stability of training without increasing the training cost and additional regional auxiliary labels.","Tongue,Sublingual veins,Segmentation,Synergistic,Attention,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Robotics,,,,ARTIFICIAL LIFE AND ROBOTICS,,

Some of the existing machine learning models still suffers from limited predication ability, and the chosen analysis approaches are not suitable. As well, it was noticed that the existing approaches pay more attention to building high accuracy models, while overlooking the ability to interpret and understand the recommendations of these models. In this research, different renowned machine learning techniques: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random Forests have been investigated to help in building, understanding and interpreting different heart disease diagnosing models. The Artificial Neural Networks model showed the best accuracy of 84.25% compared to the other models. In addition, it was found that despite some designed models have higher accuracies than others, it may be safer to choose a lower accuracy model as a final design of this study. This sacrifice was essential to make sure that a more transparent and trusted model is being used in the heart disease diagnosis process. This transparency validation was conducted using a newly suggested metric: the Feature Ranking Cost index. The use of that index showed promising results by making it clear as which machine learning model has a balance between accuracy and transparency.

A Multi-scale Receptive Field Convolutional Neural Network (MRF-CNN) for the segmentation of the liver portal areas in hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs) is proposed in this paper. The MRF-CNN adopts the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) with multiple atrous rates and symmetric encoder-decoder with feature concatenation architecture. The atrous rates in ASPP are devised of receptive fields to extract features of meaningful tissue components in parallel in portal areas. Along with the MRF-CNN, a small object sensitive loss function is also proposed to have the network focus on small portal areas and slim fibrosis. The results show that the proposed model achieves Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.87 and sensitivity of 0.92.

Extreme learning machine (ELM) provides an effective solution to achieve the goal of low-complexity CL. However, single ELM model has limited accuracy and is sensitive to the quality of data. Furthermore, hardware non-idealities in CS sensors result in learning performance degradation. In this work, we propose the ensemble of sub-eigenspace-ELM (SE-ELM), including two novel approaches: 1) We develop the eigenspace transformation for compressed noisy data, and further utilize a subspace-based dictionary to remove the interferences, and 2) Hardware-friendly design for ensemble of ELM provides high accuracy while maintaining low complexity.

In a surface mount technology (SMT) assembly line, stencil printing is a major process that affects the yield of printed circuit boards (PCBs). During printing, environmental changes may induce the PCB's printing results to deviate from initial optimal outcomes. To consistently improve the system performance, a real-time adaptation of the printer settings is an effective and cost-efficient approach. This research proposes a hybrid online optimization model by using online learning to predict real-time SPP volumes and an evolutionary search (ES) technique to determine the optimal settings. The prediction model investigates the printing volumes' transfer efficiency (TE) in averages and standard deviations (SDs) with relevant features. From the model selection of the online-based learning, the multi-layer online sequential extreme learning machine (MOSELM) shows outstanding prediction performance with R-2 values of 97% for volume averages and 81% for SDs. From the real implicational results, the system achieves a C-pk = 2.8, outperforming other advanced models.

Recognizing emotions is a challenging task due to the non-linear property of the EEG signal. This paper presents an advanced signal processing method using the deep neural network (DNN) for emotion recognition based on EEG signals. The spectral and temporal components of the raw EEG signal are first retained in the 2D Spectrogram before the extraction of features. The pre-trained AlexNet model is used to extract the raw features from the 2D Spectrogram for each channel. To reduce the feature dimensionality, spatial, and temporal based, bag of deep features (BoDF) model is proposed. A series of vocabularies consisting of 10 cluster centers of each class is calculated using the k-means cluster algorithm. Lastly, the emotion of each subject is represented using the histogram of the vocabulary set collected from the raw-feature of a single channel. Features extracted from the proposed BoDF model have considerably smaller dimensions. The proposed model achieves better classification accuracy compared to the recently reported work when validated on SJTU SEED and DEAP data sets. For optimal classification performance, we use a support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) to classify the extracted features for the different emotional states of the two data sets. The BoDF model achieves 93.8% accuracy in the SEED data set and 77.4% accuracy in the DEAP data set, which is more accurate compared to other state-of-the-art methods of human emotion recognition.","emotion recognition,brain computer interface,bag of deep features,continuous wavelet transform",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"CLASSIFICATION,CLASSIFIERS,ENTROPY",SENSORS,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/23/5218/pdf,

Forty-eight MS patients without symptoms of optic neuritis and forty-eight healthy control subjects were selected. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was performed using a DRI (deep-range imaging) Triton OCT device (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Mean values (right and left eye) for macular thickness (retinal and choroidal layers) and peripapillary area (retinal nerve fibre layer, retinal, ganglion cell layer-GCL, and choroidal layers) were compared between both groups. Based on the analysis of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), the 3 variables with the greatest discriminant capacity were selected to form the feature vector. A SVM was used as an automatic classifier, obtaining the confusion matrix using leave-one-out cross-validation. Classification performance was assessed with Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) and the AUC(CLASSIFIER). The most discriminant variables were found to be the total GCL++ thickness (between inner limiting membrane to inner nuclear layer boundaries), evaluated in the peripapillary area and macular retina thickness in the nasal quadrant of the outer and inner rings. Using the SVM classifier, we obtained the following values: MCC = 0.81, sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.92, accuracy = 0.91, and AUC(CLASSIFIER) = 0.97. Our findings suggest that it is possible to classify control subjects and MS patients without previous optic neuritis by applying machine-learning techniques to study the structural neurodegeneration in the retina.","multiple sclerosis,optical coherence tomography,support vector machine,confusion matrix",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"FOURIER-DOMAIN,OCT,NERVE-FIBER,LAYER,SPECTRAL-DOMAIN,SWEPT-SOURCE,CHOROIDAL,THICKNESS,SEGMENTATION,NEURITIS",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6928765?pdf=render,

This work explores a way of addressing these concerns, achieving the reduction of unnecessary radiation without compromising the diagnosis. We contribute with a novel methodology in the CT area to predict the precise radiation that a patient should be given to accomplish this goal. Specifically, from a real dataset composed of the dose data of over fifty thousand patients that have been classified into standardized protocols (skull, abdomen, thorax, pelvis, etc.), we eliminate atypical information (outliers), to later generate regression curves employing diverse well-known Machine Learning techniques.

In this work, we investigated the super-resolution (SR) technique using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with simulated EEG data with white Gaussian and real brain noises, and experimental EEG data obtained during an auditory evoked potential task. SR EEG simulated data with white Gaussian noise or brain noise demonstrated a lower mean squared error and higher correlations with sensor information, and detected sources even more clearly than did low resolution (LR) EEG. In addition, experimental SR data also demonstrated far smaller errors for N1 and P2 components, and yielded reasonable localized sources, while LR data did not.

In this scenario, those surgical procedures performed with an additional tool require the aid of an assistant. Furthermore, in the case of a human-robot assistant pairing a fluid communication is mandatory. This human-machine interaction must combine both explicit orders and implicit information from the surgical gestures. In this context, this paper focuses on the development of a hand gesture recognition system for HALS.

We obtained 3300 reflectance spectra from pears acquired from different lots, producers and with diverse storage times and ripening stages. The macroscopic properties of the pears, such as size, temperature and SSC were measured under controlled laboratory conditions. For the spectral analysis, we implemented a computational pipeline that incorporates multiple pre-processing techniques including a feature selection procedure, various multivariate regression models and three different validation strategies. This benchmark allowed us to find the best model/preproccesing procedure for SSC prediction from our data. From the several calibration models tested, we have found that Support Vector Machines provides the best predictions metrics with an RMSEP of around 0.82 degrees Brix and 1.09 degrees Brix for internal and external validation strategies respectively. The latter validation was implemented to assess the prediction accuracy of this calibration method under more 'real world-like' conditions. We also show that incorporating information about the fruit temperature and size to the calibration models improves SSC predictability.

A new clamping force estimation method is proposed based on a joint torque disturbance observer (JTDO) for a cable-driven surgical robot end-effector. The JTDO essentially considers the variations in cable tension between the actual cable tension and the estimated cable tension using a Particle Swarm Optimization Back Propagation Neural Network (PSO-BPNN) under free motion.

For most yoga amateurs, they could only learn yoga by self-study, like mechanically imitating from yoga video. They could not know whether they performed standardly without feedback and guidance. In this paper, we proposed a full-body posture modeling and quantitative evaluation method to recognize and evaluate yoga postures to provide guidance to the learner. Back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) was adopted as the first classifier to divide yoga postures into different categories, and fuzzy C-means (FCM) was utilized as the second classifier to classify the postures in a category. The posture data on each body part was regarded as a multidimensional Gaussian variable to build a Bayesian network. The conditional probability of the Gaussian variable corresponding to each body part relative to the Gaussian variable corresponding to the connected body part was used as criterion to quantitatively evaluate the standard degree of body parts. The angular differences between nonstandard parts and the standard model could be calculated to provide guidance with an easily-accepted language, such as ""lift up your left arm"", ""straighten your right forearm"". To evaluate our method, a wearable device with 11 inertial measurement units (IMUs) fixed onto the body was designed to measure yoga posture data with quaternion format, and the posture database with a total of 211,643 data frames and 1831 posture instances was collected from 11 subjects. Both the posture recognition test and evaluation test were conducted. In the recognition test, 30% data was randomly picked from the database to train BP-ANN and FCM classifiers, and the recognition accuracy of the remaining 70% data was 95.39%, which is highly competitive with previous posture recognition approaches. In the evaluation test, 30% data were picked randomly from subject three, subject four, and subject six, to train the Bayesian network. The probabilities of nonstandard parts were almost all smaller than 0.3, while the probabilities of standard parts were almost all greater than 0.5, and thus the nonstandard parts of body posture could be effectively separated and picked for guidance. We also tested separately the trainers' yoga posture performance in the condition of without and with guidance provided by our proposed method.

Unfortunately, audits on residences to identify potential savings, generally based on detailed energy models, tend to over-estimate anticipated savings. This leads to wariness on the part of potential investors. We address this issue by taking an integrated data- and physics-based approach, using residential building geometrical and energy system characteristics (e.g., envelope, appliances, and HVAC systems), as well as historical energy consumption for each residence and weather data, to predict monthly natural gas energy consumption and savings from the adoption of individual energy saving measures. This approach requires only those geometrical and energy system characteristics associated with the greatest potential for realized savings which are also easy to obtain. We construct a dataset from a collection of houses with a wide range of energy effectiveness, and train a single statistical model that accurately predicts natural gas energy consumption in any of the individual residences. The model is then used to estimate the savings from most impactful energy efficiency investments for individual residences, as well as the collective grouping. The specific case considered here involves hundreds of university-owned student residences in the U.S. Midwest. The resulting machine-learning derived model is used to predict monthly natural gas consumption with a mean squared error of 0.00023 for unitary scaled cross-validation data. We use a nearest neighbor approach to validate savings estimates for virtually improved residences, identifying the surrogate residence most like an improved residence. This validation demonstrates a savings prediction accuracy to within 3.5% for most of the measures considered. The validated models are shown capable of prioritizing investments among the collective of residences considered. Sequential adoption of the most cost-effective energy efficiency measure among a group of residences renders a total energy reduction of 36%. The practical implications of this research are significant. This integrated machine-learning and physics-based approach to estimate savings could be used in any utility district and throughout all of the USA to enable district-wide residential energy reduction based upon sequential adoption of the most cost-effective energy measures.","Machine learning,Data-based energy models,Residential,Energy savings,Prioritized reduction",Review,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Energy & Fuels,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,2.447,"NONLINEAR-REGRESSION,CONSUMPTION,PREDICTION,DEMAND",ENERGY EFFICIENCY,,

Dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DTDWT) can overcome those drawbacks but may increase information redundancy. For classification tasks with small dataset sizes, such redundancy can greatly reduce learning efficiency and model performance. In this work, we proposed a novel redundancy removed DTDWT (RR-DTDWT) framework for automated seizure detection. Energy and modified multi-scale entropy (MMSE) features in a dual tree wavelet domain were extracted to construct a complete picture of mental states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ MMSE as an indicator of epileptic seizures. Moreover, a compact EEG representation can be obtained after removing useless information redundancy (redundancy between wavelet trees, adjacent channels and entropy scales) by a general auto-weighted feature selection framework via global redundancy minimization (AGRM). Through validation on Bonn and CHB-MIT databases, the proposed RR-DTDWT method can achieve better performance than previous studies.","EEG monitoring,DWT,DTDWT,automated seizure detection,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"EPILEPTIC,SEIZURE,APPROXIMATE,ENTROPY,CLASSIFICATION,SIGNAL,NETWORKS,FEATURES,SYSTEM",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/23/5215/pdf,

Electronic medical records (EMR) and cancer registries contain complementary information on cancer diagnosis, treatment and outcome, yet are rarely used synergistically. To construct a cohort of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, we applied natural language processing techniques within a semisupervised machine learning framework to linked EMR-California Cancer Registry (CCR) data.
Materials and Methods: We studied all female patients treated at Stanford Health Care with an incident breast cancer diagnosis from 2000 to 2014. Our database consisted of structured fields and unstructured free-text clinical notes from EMR, linked to CCR, a component of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER). We identified de novo MBC patients from CCR and extracted information on distant recurrences from patient notes in EMR. Furthermore, we trained a regularized logistic regression model for recurrent MBC classification and evaluated its performance on a gold standard set of 146 patients.
Results: There were 11 459 breast cancer patients in total and the median follow-up time was 96.3 months. We identified 1886 MBC patients, 512 (27.1%) of whom were de novo MBC patients and 1374 (72.9%) were recurrent MBC patients. Our final MBC classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.917, with sensitivity 0.861, specificity 0.878, and accuracy 0.870.
Discussion and Conclusion: To enable population-based research on MBC, we developed a framework for retrospective case detection combining EMR and CCR data.

The problem with this method lies in determining the relationship between the shape of the soil spectral response and soil physical or chemical properties. The LUCAS soil database collected by the EU's ESDAC research centre is good material to analyse the relationship between the soil properties and the near infrared (NIR) spectral response. The modelling described in the paper is based on these data. The analysis of the impact of soil properties configuration on absorbance levels in various NIR spectrum ranges was conducted using the stepwise regression models with the properties, properties squared and products of properties being explanatory variables. The analysis of partial correlation of soil properties values with absorbance values and absorbance derivative in the entire spectral range was conducted in order to evaluate the impact of the absorbance transformation (the first derivative of absorbance vector) on the change of significance of relationship with properties values. The Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models were used to estimate the absorbance relationship with single soil features. Soil property modelling based on the selection and transformation algorithm of raw values and first and second absorbance derivatives was also conducted along with the suitability evaluation of such models in building digital soil maps. The absorbance is affected by a limited number of tested soil features like pH, texture, content of carbonates, SOC, N, and CEC; P and K contents have, in case of this research, a negligible impact. The NIR methodology can be suitable in conditions of limited soil variation and particularly in development of thematic soil maps.","LUCAS database,near-infrared spectroscopy,soil properties prediction",Article,"POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO GLEBOZNAWC, POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO GLEBOZNAWC, WARSAW, 00000, POLAND",Agriculture,,,SPECTROSCOPY,SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL,https://doi.org/10.2478/ssa-2019-0027,

Multiscale models of cardiac growth can provide a patient-specific window into the progression of heart failure and guide personalized treatment planning. Yet, the predictive potential of cardiac growth models remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify predictive power of a stretch-driven growth model using a chronic porcine heart failure model, subject-specific multiscale simulation, and machine learning techniques. We combine hierarchical modeling, Bayesian inference, and Gaussian process regression to quantify the uncertainty of our experimental measurements during an 8-week long study of volume overload in six pigs. We then propagate the experimental uncertainties from the organ scale through our computational growth model and quantify the agreement between experimentally measured and computationally predicted alterations on the cellular scale. Our study suggests that stretch is the major stimulus for myocyte lengthening and demonstrates that a stretch-driven growth model alone can explain 52.7% of the observed changes in myocyte morphology. We anticipate that our approach will allow us to design, calibrate, and validate a new generation of multiscale cardiac growth models to explore the interplay of various subcellular-, cellular-, and organ-level contributors to heart failure.

The problem of detecting building footprints in optical, multispectral satellite data is not easy to solve in a general way due to the extreme variability of material, shape, spatial, and spectral patterns that may come with disparate environmental conditions and construction practices rooted in different places across the globe. This difficult problem has been tackled in many different ways since multispectral satellite data at a sufficient spatial resolution started making its appearance on the public scene at the turn of the century. Whereas a typical approach, until recently, hinged on various combinations of spectral-spatial analysis and image processing techniques, in more recent times, the role of machine learning has undergone a progressive expansion. This is also testified by the appearance of online challenges like SpaceNet, which invite scholars to submit their own artificial intelligence (AI)-based, tailored solutions for building footprint detection in satellite data, and automatically compare and rank by accuracy the proposed maps. In this framework, after reviewing the state-of-the-art on this subject, we came to the conclusion that some improvement could be contributed to the so-called U-Net architecture, which has shown to be promising in this respect. In this work, we focused on the architecture of the U-Net to develop a suitable version for this task, capable of competing with the accuracy levels of past SpaceNet competition winners using only one model and one type of data. This achievement could pave the way for achieving better performances than the current state-of-the-art. All these results, indeed, have yet to be augmented through the integration of techniques that in the past have demonstrated a capability of improving the detection accuracy of U-net-based footprint detectors. The most notable cases are represented by an ensemble of different U-Net architectures, the integration of distance transform to improve boundary detection accuracy, and the incorporation of ancillary geospatial data on buildings.

An early-stage diagnosis is of crucial importance to lower patient mortality and preserve both the laryngeal anatomy and vocal-fold function. However, this may be challenging as the initial larynx modifications, mainly concerning the mucosa vascular tree and the epithelium texture and color, are small and can pass unnoticed to the human eye. The primary goal of this paper was to investigate a learning-based approach to early-stage SCC diagnosis, and compare the use of (i) texture-based global descriptors, such as local binary patterns, and (ii) deep-learning-based descriptors. These features, extracted from endoscopic narrow-band images of the larynx, were classified with support vector machines as to discriminate healthy, precancerous, and early-stage SCC tissues. When tested on a benchmark dataset, a median classification recall of 98% was obtained with the best feature combination, outperforming the state of the art (recall = 95%). Despite further investigation is needed (e.g., testing on a larger dataset), the achieved results support the use of the developed methodology in the actual clinical practice to provide accurate early-stage SCC diagnosis.

Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)-a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. Approach: The training data set was composed of 78278 30s long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed-a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30s PPG signals from 13 stroke patients. Main results: ResNet18 showed a higher performance (0.985 accuracy, 0.979 specificity, and 0.988 sensitivity) than SVM and other deep learning approaches. 2D-based models were generally more accurate than 1D-based models. Significance: 2D representation of PPG signal enhances the accuracy of PPG signal quality assessment.","photoplethysmography,atrial fibrillation,signal quality assessment,deep learning,convolutional neural networks",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,2.866,"TIME,NETWORKS,STROKE",PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198064,
51,Temperature and Rainfall Are Separate Agents of Selection Shaping Population Differentiation in a Forest Tree,10,12,,"Costa e Silva Joao,Potts Brad,Harrison Peter A.,Bailey Tanya","Silva JCE,Potts B,Harrison PA,Bailey T",Silva JCE,10.3390/f10121145,Universidade de Lisboa,"Research highlights: We present evidence indicating that covariation of functional traits among populations of a forest tree is not due to genetic constraints, but rather selective covariance arising from local adaptation to different facets of the climate, namely rainfall and temperature. Background and Aims: Traits frequently covary among natural populations. Such covariation can be caused by pleiotropy and/or linkage disequilibrium, but also may arise when the traits are genetically independent as a direct consequence of natural selection, drift, mutation and/or gene flow. Of particular interest are cases of selective covariance, where natural selection directly generates among-population covariance in a set of genetically independent traits. We here studied the causes of population-level covariation in two key traits in the Australian tree Eucalyptus pauciflora. Materials and Methods: We studied covariation in seedling lignotuber size and vegetative juvenility using 37 populations sampled from throughout the geographic and ecological ranges of E. pauciflora on the island of Tasmania. We integrated evidence from multiple sources: (i) comparison of patterns of trait covariation within and among populations; (ii) climate-trait modelling using machine-learning algorithms; and (iii) selection analysis linking trait variation to field growth in an arid environment. Results: We showed strong covariation among populations compared with the weak genetic correlation within populations for the focal traits. Population differentiation in these genetically independent traits was correlated with different home-site climate variables (lignotuber size with temperature; vegetative juvenility with rainfall), which spatially covaried. The role of selection in shaping the population differentiation in lignotuber size was supported by its relationship with fitness measured in the field. Conclusions: Our study highlights the multi-trait nature of adaptation likely to occur as tree species respond to spatial and temporal changes in climate.","provenance differentiation,among-population covariance,genetic correlation,adaptation to aridity,lignotuber,leaf ontogeny,Eucalyptus pauciflora",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Forestry,,2.804,"VEGETATIVE,PHASE-CHANGE,EUCALYPTUS-GLOBULUS,NATURAL-SELECTION,GENETIC-CONTROL,CLIMATE-CHANGE,QUANTITATIVE,TRAITS,WATER,AVAILABILITY,EVOLUTIONARY,ADAPTATION,LIGNOTUBER",FORESTS,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/12/1145/pdf,

Existing wireless systems often require intracranial wires to connect implanted electrodes to an external head stage or/and deploy an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is battery-powered or externally power-transferred, raising safety concerns such as infection, electronics failure, or heat-induced tissue damage. This work presents a biocompatible, flexible, implantable neural recorder capable of wireless acquisition of neuropotentials without wires, batteries, energy harvesting units, or active electronics. The recorder, fabricated on a thin polyimide substrate, features a small footprint of 9 mm x 8 mm x 0.3 mm and is composed of passive electronic components. The absence of active electronics on the device leads to near zero power consumption, inherently avoiding the catastrophic failure of active electronics. We performed both in vitro validation in a tissue-simulating phantom and in vivo validation in an epileptic rat. The fully passive wireless recorder was implanted under rat scalp to measure neuropotentials from its contact electrodes. The implanted wireless recorder demonstrated its capability to capture low voltage neuropotentials, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Wirelessly recorded SSEP and IED signals were directly compared to those from wired electrodes to demonstrate the efficacy of the wireless data. In addition, a convoluted neural network-based machine learning algorithm successfully achieved IED signal recognition accuracy as high as 100 and 91% in wired and wireless IED data, respectively. These results strongly support the fully passive wireless neural recorder's capability to measure neuropotentials as low as tens of microvolts. With further improvement, the recorder system presented in this work may find wide applications in future brain machine interface systems.","neural recorder,implantable,wireless,flexible,fully passive",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,8.162,"EXTRAOPERATIVE,ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY,EEG,SYSTEM,ECOG,COMPLICATIONS,MICROSYSTEM,INTERFACE,IMPLANT,FIELDS",ACS SENSORS,,

One of the effects of stroke is foot drop. Foot drop (FD) is a weakness that occurs in specific muscles in the ankle and foot such as the anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus muscles. Foot flexion and extension are normally generated by lower motor neurons (LMN). The affected muscles impact the ankle and foot in both downward and upward motions. One possible solution for FD is to investigate the movement based on the bio signal (myoelectric signal) of the muscles. Bio signal control systems like electromyography (EMG) are used for rehabilitation devices that include foot drop. One of these systems is function electrical stimulation (FES). This paper proposes new methods and algorithms to develop the performance of myoelectric pattern recognition (M-PR), to improve automated rehabilitation devices, to test these methodologies in offline and real-time experimental datasets. Label classifying is a predictive data mining application with multiple applications in the world, including automatic labeling of resources such as videos, music, images and texts. We combine the label classification method with the self-advised support vector machine (SA-SVM) to create an adapted and altered label classification method, named the label self-advised support vector machine (LSA-SVM). For the experimental data, we collected data from foot drop patients using the sEMG device, in the Metro Rehabilitation Hospital in Sydney, Australia using Ethical Approval (UTS HREC NO. ETH15-0152). The experimental results for the EMG dataset and benchmark datasets exhibit its benefits. Furthermore, the experimental results on UCI datasets indicate that LSA-SVM achieves the best performance when working together with SA-SVM and SVM.

55,A Machine-Learning-Based Prediction Method for Hypertension Outcomes Based on Medical Data,9,4,,"Chang Wenbing,Liu Yinglai,Xiao Yiyong,Yuan Xinglong,Xu Xingxing,Zhang Siyue,Zhou Shenghan","Chang WB,Liu YL,Xiao YY,Yuan XL,Xu XX,Zhang SY,Zhou SH",Zhou SH,10.3390/diagnostics9040178,Beihang University,"The outcomes of hypertension refer to the death or serious complications (such as myocardial infarction or stroke) that may occur in patients with hypertension. The outcomes of hypertension are very concerning for patients and doctors, and are ideally avoided. However, there is no satisfactory method for predicting the outcomes of hypertension. Therefore, this paper proposes a prediction method for outcomes based on physical examination indicators of hypertension patients. In this work, we divide the patients' outcome prediction into two steps. The first step is to extract the key features from the patients' many physical examination indicators. The second step is to use the key features extracted from the first step to predict the patients' outcomes. To this end, we propose a model combining recursive feature elimination with a cross-validation method and classification algorithm. In the first step, we use the recursive feature elimination algorithm to rank the importance of all features, and then extract the optimal features subset using cross-validation. In the second step, we use four classification algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) to accurately predict patient outcomes by using their optimal features subset. The selected model prediction performance evaluation metrics are accuracy, F1 measure, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve. The 10-fold cross-validation shows that C4.5, RF, and XGBoost can achieve very good prediction results with a small number of features, and the classifier after recursive feature elimination with cross-validation feature selection has better prediction performance. Among the four classifiers, XGBoost has the best prediction performance, and its accuracy, F1, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values are 94.36%, 0.875, and 0.927, respectively, using the optimal features subset.

The Gleason score is a pathological grading system to examine the potential aggressiveness of the disease in the prostate tissue. Advancements in computing and next-generation sequencing technology now allow us to study the genomic profiles of patients in association with their different Gleason scores more accurately and effectively. (2) Methods: In this study, we used a novel machine learning method to analyse gene expression of prostate tumours with different Gleason scores, and identify potential genetic biomarkers for each Gleason group. We obtained a publicly-available RNA-Seq dataset of a cohort of 104 prostate cancer patients from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, and categorised patients based on their Gleason scores to create a hierarchy of disease progression. A hierarchical model with standard classifiers in different Gleason groups, also known as nodes, was developed to identify and predict nodes based on their mRNA or gene expression. In each node, patient samples were analysed via class imbalance and hybrid feature selection techniques to build the prediction model. The outcome from analysis of each node was a set of genes that could differentiate each Gleason group from the remaining groups. To validate the proposed method, the set of identified genes were used to classify a second dataset of 499 prostate cancer patients collected from cBioportal. (3) Results: The overall accuracy of applying this novel method to the first dataset was 93.3%; the method was further validated to have 87% accuracy using the second dataset. This method also identified genes that were not previously reported as potential biomarkers for specific Gleason groups. In particular, PIAS3 was identified as a potential biomarker for Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7, and UBE2V2 for Gleason score 6. (4) Insight: Previous reports show that the genes predicted by this newly proposed method strongly correlate with prostate cancer development and progression. Furthermore, pathway analysis shows that both PIAS3 and UBE2V2 share similar protein interaction pathways, the JAK/STAT signaling process.","supervised learning,next generation sequencing,classification,transcriptomics,Gleason score detection,prostate cancer",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",General & Internal Medicine,,3.674,"SIGNAL,TRANSDUCER,ACTIVATOR,TRANSCRIPTION-5,EXPRESSION,INHIBITOR,MIGRATION,PROTEINS,CELLS",DIAGNOSTICS,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/9/4/219/pdf,

Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain becomes damaged, whereas DR is a complication of diabetes caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye. In order to produce an accurate and early diagnosis, an extremely high number of retinal images needs to be processed.

This paper presents various preprocessing methods to analyse fundus images, which can serve as a diagnostic tool for detection of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. In the proposed adaptive thresholding-based preprocessing method, features were selected by calculating the area of the segmented optic disk, which was further classified using a feedforward neural network (NN). The analysis was carried out using feature extraction through existing methodologies such as adaptive thresholding, histogram and wavelet transform.

The 160 regions of interest (ROIs) in the human brain determined by the Dosenbach's template have been divided into six functional networks with different functions. In the present paper, the complexity of the human brain is characterized by the sample entropy (SampEn) of dynamic functional connectivity (FC) which is obtained by analyzing the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from healthy participants. The 160 ROIs are clustered into six clusters by applying the K-means clustering algorithm to the SampEn of dynamic FC as well as the static FC which is also obtained by analyzing the resting-state fMRI data. The six clusters obtained from the SampEn of dynamic FC and the static FC show very high overlap and consistency ratios with the six functional networks. Furthermore, for four of six clusters, the overlap ratios corresponding to the SampEn of dynamic FC are larger than that corresponding to the static FC, and for five of six clusters, the consistency ratios corresponding to the SampEn of dynamic FC are larger than that corresponding to the static FC. The results show that the combination of machine learning methods and the FC obtained using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals can identify the functional networks of the human brain, and nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the FC are more effective than the static characteristics of the FC in identifying brain functional networks and the complexity of the human brain.","sample entropy,brain functional networks,complexity,dynamic functional connectivity,static functional connectivity,K-means clustering algorithm",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Physics,,2.587,"CONNECTIVITY,PARCELLATION,FLUCTUATIONS,DYNAMICS",ENTROPY,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/12/1156/pdf,

In this paper, we show another success in orthodontics. In orthodontics, the right treatment timing of many actions and operations is crucial because many environmental and genetic conditions may modify jaw growth. The stage of growth is related to the Cervical Vertebra Maturation (CVM) degree. Thus, determining the CVM to determine the suitable timing of the treatment is important. In orthodontics, lateral X-ray radiography is used to determine it. Many classical methods need knowledge and time to look and identify some features. Nowadays, ML and AI tools are used for many medical and biological diagnostic imaging. This paper reports on the development of a Deep Learning (DL) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method to determine (directly from images) the degree of maturation of CVM classified in six degrees. The results show the performances of the proposed method in different contexts with different number of images for training, evaluation and testing and different pre-processing of these images.

In the following, the statistics of these patterns, quantified using entropic tools, are explored in order to uncover the specifics of the dynamics of heart contraction based on RR intervals. The 33 measures of HRV (standard and new ones) were estimated from four hour nocturnal recordings obtained from 181 healthy people of different ages and analyzed with the machine learning methods. The validation of the methods was based on the results obtained from shuffled data. The exploratory factor analysis provided five factors driving the HRV. We hypothesize that these factors could be related to the commonly assumed physiological sources of HRV: (i) activity of the vagal nervous system; (ii) dynamical balance in the autonomic nervous system; (iii) sympathetic activity; (iv) homeostatic stability; and (v) humoral effects. In particular, the indices describing patterns: their total volume, as well as their distribution, showed important aspects of the organization of the ANS control: the presence or absence of a strong correlation between the patterns' indices, which distinguished the original rhythms of people from their shuffled representatives. Supposing that the dynamic organization of RR intervals is age dependent, classification with the support vector machines was performed. The classification results proved to be strongly dependent on the parameters of the methods used, therefore determining that the age group was not obvious.","heart rate variability,entropy,fragmentation,aging in human population,factor analysis,support vector machines classification",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Physics,,2.587,"RATE-VARIABILITY,RHYTHM,RESPONSIVENESS,ARRHYTHMIAS,COMPLEXITY,STATEMENT,ENTROPY,SYSTEM,SLEEP",ENTROPY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7514550,

It refers to finding the optimal subset of a spectral library to reconstruct the image data and further estimate the proportions of different materials. Recently, multi-objective based sparse unmixing methods have presented promising performance because of their advantages in addressing combinatorial problems. A spectral and multi-objective based sparse unmixing (SMoSU) algorithm was proposed in our previous work, which solves the decision-making problem well. However, it does not show outstanding advantages in strong noise cases. To solve the problem, in this paper, SMoSU is improved based on the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). The machine learning based EDAs have been a reliable approach in solving multi-objective problems. However, most of them are for special problems and relatively weak in theoretical foundations. Thus, it is unreliable to extend it directly to sparse unmixing. Here, we improve EDA on the basis of classification and propose a classification-based model for individual generating under the framework of SMoSU (CM-MoSU). In CM-MoSU, the whole population is divided to be positive and negative. Then, the macroinformation of positive individuals is used to guide the generation of new individuals. Therefore, the optimization task could pay more attention to the feasible space with high quality. Moreover, some theoretical analyses are presented to prove the reliability of CM-MoSU. In experiments, several state-of-the-art sparse unmixing algorithms are compared.

The vast chemical complexity accessible within this class of polymers gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of novel polymer chemistries for specific applications. The burgeoning field of polymer informatics addresses this challenge via providing tools and strategies for accelerated property prediction and materials design via surrogate machine-learning models built on reliable past data. In this contribution, we use glass transition temperature T-g as an example target property to demonstrate promise of the data-enabled route to accelerated learning of accurate structure-property mappings in PHA-based polymers. Our analysis uses a data set of experimentally measured T-g values, polymer molecular weights, and a polydispersity index for PHA-based homo- and copolymers that was carefully assembled from the literature. A fingerprinting scheme that captures key properties based on topology, shape, and charge/polarity of specific chemical units or motifs forming the polymer backbone was devised to numerically represent the polymers. A validated statistical learning model is then developed to allow for a mapping of the polymer fingerprints onto the property space in a physically meaningful and reliable manner. Once developed, the model can not only rapidly predict the property of new PHA polymers but also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. The model is further combined with an evolutionary-algorithm-based search strategy to efficiently identify multicomponent polymer compositions with a prespecified T-g. While the present contribution is focused specifically on T-g, the surrogate model development approach put forward here is general and can, in principle, be extended to a range of other properties.","MICROBIAL SYNTHESIS,PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA,BEARING PHENYL,BIOSYNTHESIS,POLYMERS,MONOMER,POLY(3-HYDROXYBUTYRATE-CO-3-HYDROXYVALERATE),POLY(3-HYDROXYBUTYRATE),ALGORITHMS,MECHANICS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Chemistry,Computer Science",,5.39,"MICROBIAL,SYNTHESIS,PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA,BEARING,PHENYL,BIOSYNTHESIS,POLYMERS,MONOMER,POLY%283-HYDROXYBUTYRATE-CO-3-HYDROXYVALERATE%29,POLY%283-HYDROXYBUTYRATE%29,ALGORITHMS,MECHANICS",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1579702,

This paper details a design method to identify perceptions of sustainable features (PerSFs) by collecting online reviews, manually annotating them using crowdsourced work, and processing the annotated review fragments with a natural language machine learning algorithm. We analyze all three pillars of sustainability-social, environmental, and economic-for positive and negative perceptions of product features of a French press coffee carafe. For social aspects, the results show that positive PerSFs are associated with intangible features, such as giving the product as a gift, while negative PerSFs are associated with tangible features perceived as unsafe, like sharp corners. For environmental aspects, positive PerSFs are associated with reliable materials like metal while negative PerSFs are associated with the use of plastic. For economic aspects, PerSFs mainly serve as a price constraint for designers to satisfy other customer perceptions. We also show that some crucial sustainability concerns related to environmental aspects, like energy and water consumption, did not have a significant impact on customer sentiment, thus demonstrating the anticipated gap in sustainability perceptions and the realities of sustainable design, as noted in previous literature. From these results, online reviews can enable designers to extract PerSFs for further design study and to create products that resonate with customers' sustainable values.","design automation,sustainable design,customer perceptions,online reviews",Article; Proceedings Paper,"ASME, TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",Engineering,,3.602,RISK,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,,

The proposed method consists of three steps: conceptual design generation, design clustering, and Bayesian optimization. In the first step, a conceptual design is generated using the hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) algorithm. In the second step, threshold-based cluster analysis yields a lower-dimensional design. Here, a cluster validity index for structural optimization is introduced in order to qualitatively evaluate the clustered design. In the third step, the optimal design is obtained through Bayesian optimization, minimizing a constrained expected improvement function. This function allows to impose soft constraints by properly redefining the expected improvement based on the maximum constraint violation. The Bayesian optimization algorithm implemented in this work has the ability to search over (i) a real design space for sizing optimization, (ii) a categorical design space for material selection, or (iii) a mixed design space for concurrent sizing optimization and material selection. With the proposed method, materials are optimally selected based on multiple attributes and multiple objectives without the need for material ranking. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated with the design for crashworthiness of multimaterial plates and thin-walled structures.","structural optimization,finite element-based optimization,Bayesian optimization,metamodel-based design,clustering,multimaterial structures,design optimization,metamodeling,multidisciplinary design and optimization",Article,"ASME, TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",Engineering,,3.602,"TOPOLOGY,OPTIMIZATION,SHAPE,OPTIMIZATION",JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN,https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/1805/23272/1/Liu2019Design.pdf,

Finite element method (FEM) analyses that precisely recreate the morphology of corroded surfaces using solid elements are expected to accurately assess the strength; however, the cost of conducting these calculations is extremely high. Therefore, a model that uses mean thickness as the thickness of the shell element is widely used but this method has precision issues, particularly regarding overestimation of risk. Thus, this study proposes a method of structural analysis in which the effective thickness of a shell element is assessed using the convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning performed on tensile structural members. An FEM model is then built based on the shell element that uses this effective thickness. We cross-validated this method by adding a feature extraction layer that reflects the domain knowledge, together with convolutional and pooling layers that are commonly used for CNN and found that a high level of accuracy could be achieved.

Before running the neural network, the test data were normalized to effectively run the problem and after solving the problem, the obtained results were again converted in order to achieve the actual data. According to the predicted results, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the average absolute relative error between the predicted flow stress and the experimental data were determined as 0.999 and 1.335%, respectively. For improving the model predictability, the constrained nonlinear function based optimization procedures was adopted to obtain the best candidate selections of weights and biases. By evaluating each test conditions, it was found that the average absolute relative error based on the optimized ANN-BP model varied from 0.728% to 1.775%.

Our experiments compare a mean squared error loss function with a perceptual loss function to emphasize preservation of image features and texture. Both visual and quantitative metrics are used to assess the resulting image quality for metal implant cases. Success may be due to the duality of information processing, with one network stream performing local structure correction, while the other stream provides an attention mechanism to destreak effectively.

As for pterygium localization, an additional step of box proposal based on edges information is used to generate possible regions of the pterygium infected tissues. Hanning window is also applied to the generated regions to give more weightage to the center area. Experimental results show that Pterygium-Net produces high average detection sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 and 0.983, respectively. As for pterygium tissues localization, the algorithm achieves 0.811 accuracy with a very low failure rate of 0.053. In the future, deeper networks can be implemented to further improve pterygium localization.","Pterygium detection,Pterygium localization,Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

Early diagnosis gives patients with diabetes the opportunity to improve their dietary habits and lifestyle and manage the disease successfully. Several studies have explored the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and diagnose this disease. In this study, we conducted experiments to predict diabetes in Pima Indian females with particular ML classifiers. (2) Method: A Pima Indian diabetes dataset (PIDD) with 768 female patients was considered for this study. Different data mining operations were performed to a conduct comparative analysis of four different ML classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB), J48, Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). These models were analyzed by different cross-validation (K = 5, 10, 15, and 20) values, and the performance measurements of accuracy, precision, F-score, recall, and AUC were calculated for each model. (3) Results: LR was found to have the highest accuracy (0.77) for all 'k' values. When k = 5, the accuracy of J48, NB, and RF was found to be 0.71, 0.76, and 0.75. For k = 10, the accuracy of J48, NB, and RF was found to be 0.73, 0.76, 0.74, while for k = 15, 20, the accuracy of NB was found to be 0.76. The accuracy of J48 and RF was found to be 0.76 when k = 15, and 0.75 when k = 20. Other parameters, such as precision, f-score, recall, and AUC, were also considered in evaluations to rank the algorithms. (4) Conclusion: The present study on PIDD sought to identify an optimized ML model, using with cross-validation methods. The AUC of LR was 0.83, RF 0.82, and NB 0.81).

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and the informed consent requirement was waived. From March 2016 to March 2018, 119 Chinese patients with pathologically confirmed stage II CRC, available MSI status, and preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images were included in this study. Clinical and pathological information was obtained from the institutional database. The radiomics features were extracted from portal venous-phase CT images of segmented volumes of each entire primary tumor by using Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB), and radiomics signatures were generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model. The minority group was balanced via synthetic minority over-sampling technique method. The association between the clinicopathologic characteristics and MSI status was assessed using Student's t test, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact test. The predictive efficacy of MSI status using radiomics features, clinical factors (including age, gender, CT-reported tumor location, differentiation degree of tumor, smoking history, hypertension history, family history of cancer, diabetes history, level of the Ki-67 expression, and laboratory analysis) and the combined models were evaluated, respectively. Predictive performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Results: MSI status was significantly associated with tumor location (p = 0.043); differentiation degree of tumor (p < 0.0001), hypertension history (p = 0.012), and the level of the Ki-67 expression (p = 0.015). Six radiomics features and 11 clinical characteristics were selected for predicting MSI status. The model that used the combination of clinical factors and radiomics features achieved the overall best performance than using either of the two features alone, yielding the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.752, 0.663, 0.841 for the combined model, 0.598, 0.371, 0.825 for clinical factors alone, and 0.688, 0.517, 0.858 for radiomics features alone, respectively.
Conclusion: CT-based radiomic features of stage II CRC are associated with MSI status.

Materials and Methods: A convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture was trained to perform muscle segmentation on a dataset of 1875 single slice CT images and was tested on 209 CT images of participants in the National Lung Screening Trial. Low-dose, noncontrast CT examinations were obtained at 33 clinical sites, using scanners from four manufacturers. The study participants had a mean age of 71.6 years (range, 70-74 years). Ground truth was obtained by manually segmenting the left paraspinous muscle at the level of the T12 vertebra. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle attenuation (MA) were recorded. Comparison between the ML algorithm and ground truth measures of muscle CSA and MA were obtained using Dice similarity coefficients and Pearson correlations.
Results: Compared to ground truth segmentation, the ML algorithm achieved median (standard deviation) Dice scores of 0.94 (0.04) in the test set. Mean (SD) muscle CSA was 14.3 (3.6) cm(2) for ground truth and 13.7 (3.5) cm(2) for ML segmentation. Mean (SD) MA was 41.6 (7.6) Hounsfield units (HU) for ground truth and 43.5 (7.9) HU for ML segmentation. There was high correlation between ML algorithm and ground truth for muscle CSA (r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.0001) and MA (r(2) = 0.95; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: The ML algorithm for measurement of paraspinous muscles compared favorably to manual ground truth measurements in the NLST.

However, due to the existence of scaling relations for the adsorption of reaction intermediates, there is a long established trade-off between the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, as the enhancement of catalytic activity is typically accompanied by a four-electron O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the reduced selectivity for the H2O2 production. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported the feasibility of several classes of important and representative experimentally achievable single-atom catalysts (SACs) toward two-electron ORR, paying attention to their stability, selectivity, and activity at the acidic medium. Starting from 210 two-dimensional (2D) SACs, we demonstrated that 31 SACs have the potential to break the metal-based scaling relations and simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity toward H2O2 production and screened out 7 SACs with higher activity than the PtHg4 in acidic media. Especially, a noble metal-free SAC, namely, a single Zn atom centered phthalocyanine (Zn@Pc-N-4), has a remarkable activity improvement with a small overpotential of 0.15 V. Moreover, using multivariable analysis and machine-learning techniques, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the underlying origin of the selectivity and activity of SACs and unveiled the intrinsic correlations between structure and catalytic performance. This work may pave a way to the design and discovery of more promising materials for H2O2 production.","single-atom catalysts,two-dimensional materials,oxygen reduction reaction,H2O2 production,density functional theory calculations,machine learning",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,13.721,"HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE,SYNTHESIS,OXYGEN,REDUCTION,PALLADIUM,CATALYSTS,ALLOY,CATALYSTS,RATIONAL,DESIGN,H2O2,PD,NITRIDE,EVOLUTION,ELECTROCATALYSIS",ACS CATALYSIS,,

Recent advancements in machine learning offer considerable opportunities to evolve photocatalysts discovery practices. Machine learning has largely facilitated various areas of science and engineering, including heterogeneous catalysis, but adaptation of it in photocatalysis research is still at an elementary stage. The scarcity of consistent training data is a major bottleneck, and we foresee the integration of photo-catalysis domain knowledge in mainstream machine learning protocols as a viable solution. Here, we present a holistic framework incorporating machine learning and domain knowledge to set directions toward accelerated discovery of solar photocatalysts. This Perspective begins with a discussion on domain knowledge available in photocatalysis which could potentially be leveraged to liaise with machine learning methods. Subsequently, we present prevalent machine learning practices in heterogeneous catalysis tailored to assist discovery of photocatalysts in a purely data-driven fashion. Lastly, we conceptualize various strategies for complementing data-driven machine learning with photocatalysis domain knowledge. The strategies involve the following: (i) integration of theoretical and prior empirical knowledge during the training of machine learning models; (ii) embedding the knowledge in feature space; and (iii) utilizing existing material databases to constrain machine learning predictions. The aforementioned human-in-loop framework (leveraging both human and machine intelligence) could possibly mitigate the lack of interpretability and reliability associated with data-driven machine learning and reinforce complex model architectures irrespective of data scarcity. The concept could also offer substantial benefits to photocatalysis informatics by promoting a paradigm shift away from the Edisonian approach.","photocatalysis,machine learning,domain knowledge,photocatalyst discovery,high-throughput,database",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,13.721,"ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,ELECTRON-DIFFUSION,LENGTH,HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION,HETEROGENEOUS,PHOTOCATALYSIS,ELECTROCHEMICAL,SYNTHESIS,COMBINATORIAL,DISCOVERY,CHARGE,SEPARATION,REDUCTION,EVOLUTION,CATALYSIS",ACS CATALYSIS,,

A variety of autoantibodies have been associated with different subtypes of limbic encephalitis, whereas its MR imaging signature is uniformly characterized by mesiotemporal abnormalities across subtypes. Here, we hypothesized that patients with limbic encephalitis would show subtype-specific mesiotemporal structural correlates, which could be classified by supervised machine learning on an individual level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T1WI MPRAGE scans from 46 patients with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and 34 patients with antibodies against the voltage-gated potassium channel complex (including 10 patients with leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 autoantibodies) and 48 healthy controls were retrospectively ascertained. Parcellation of the amygdala, hippocampus, and hippocampal subfields was performed using FreeSurfer. Volumes were extracted and compared between groups using unpaired, 2-tailed t tests. The volumes of hippocampal subfields were analyzed using a multivariate linear model and a binary decision tree classifier. RESULTS: Temporomesial volume alterations were most pronounced in an early stage and in the affected hemispheric side of patients. Statistical analysis revealed antibody-specific hippocampal fingerprints with a higher volume of CA1 in patients with glutamic acid decarboxylase?associated limbic encephalitis (P?=?.02), compared with controls, whereas CA1 did not differ from that in controls in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel complex autoantibodies. The classifier could successfully distinguish between patients with autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 and glutamic acid decarboxylase with a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 80%.

Materials and methods: Patients with a total of 212 eligible calcifications were recruited (159 cases in the primary cohort and 53 cases in the validation cohort). In total, 8286 radiomic features were extracted from the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) images. Machine learning was used to select features and build a radiomic signature. The clinical risk factors were selected from the independent clinical factors through logistic regression analyses. The radiomic nomogram incorporated the radiomic signature and an independent clinical risk factor. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model and the radiologists' empirical prediction model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The differences between the various AUCs were compared with DeLong's test.
Results: Six radiomic features and the menopausal state were included in the radiomic nomogram, which discriminated benign calcifications from malignant calcifications with an AUC of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The difference between the classification results of the radiomic nomogram and that of radiologists was significant (p < 0.05). Particularly for patients with calcifications that are negative on ultrasounds but can be detected by mammography (MG+/US-calcifications), the identification ability of the radiomic nomogram was very strong.
Conclusions: The mammography-based radiomic nomogram is a potential tool to distinguish benign calcifications from malignant calcifications.","Radiomics,Breast,Calcification,Predictive value of test,Unnecessary procedures",Article,"ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD, ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"BREAST-CANCER,MICROCALCIFICATION,DESCRIPTORS,SCREENING,MAMMOGRAPHY,REGULARIZATION,PATHS,RISK,CHEMORADIOTHERAPY,PERFORMANCE,WOMEN,MODEL",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,,

Due to the cost or imprecision of some methods applied in this activity, there is a need to automate the procedure of reservoir characterization. Machine learning techniques can be efficient alternatives to lithology identification. To acquire proper performance, usually, some parameters of these techniques should be adjusted, and this can become a hard task depending on the complexity of the underlying problem. This letter integrates the gradient boosting (GB) with a differential evolution (DE) for formation lithology identification using data from the Daniudui gas field and the Hangjinqi gas field. This letter's contributions include the use of an evolutionary algorithm to adjust optimally the hyperparameters of the GB, and the results show improvements when compared with those obtained in the literature.","Differential evolution (DE),gradient boosting (GB),lithology",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Geochemistry & Geophysics,Engineering,Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,3.986,REGRESSION,IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS,,
97,A Long Short-Term Memory Network for Vessel Reconstruction Based on Laser Doppler Flowmetry via a Steerable Needle,19,23,11367-11376,"Virdyawan Vani,Rodriguez y Baena Ferdinando","Virdyawan V,Baena FRY",Baena FRY,10.1109/JSEN.2019.2934013,Imperial College London,"Hemorrhage is one risk of percutaneous intervention in the brain that can be life-threatening. Steerable needles can avoid blood vessels thanks to their ability to follow curvilinear paths, although knowledge of vessel pose is required. To achieve this, we present the deployment of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) sensors as an in-situ vessel detection method for steerable needles. Since the perfusion value from an LDF system does not provide positional information directly, we propose the use of a machine learning technique based on a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network to perform vessel reconstruction online. Firstly, the LSTM is used to predict the diameter and position of an approaching vessel based on successive measurements of a single LDF probe. Secondly, a ""no-go"" area is predicted based on the measurement from four LDF probes embedded within a steerable needle, which accounts for the full vessel pose. The network was trained using simulation data and tested on experimental data, with 75% diameter prediction accuracy and 0.27 mm positional Root Mean Square (RMS) Error for the single probe network, and 77% vessel volume overlap for the 4-probe setup.","Laser Doppler flowmetry,vessel reconstruction,percutaneous intervention,steerable needle,machine learning,long short-term memory (LSTM)",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"BRAIN,PROBE",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/7361/8901508/08792101.pdf,

Vibratory bowl feeders (VBF) are commonly used to accomplish this task. Nowadays, the design process of the VBF is based on a manual and expensive trial-and-error approach, in which different traps are arranged and tuned. This paper outlines a method which modifies this conventional process using Reinforcement Learning to automate the VBF design. To enable this, a software agent is used to model the placement of traps on multiple positions and measure the subsequent configuration efficiency. A physics simulation provides the characteristics of the individual traps. During the training, Q-learning is applied to determine the environmental indicators under which a certain trap should be replaced. A 3D matrix is used to store information in a problem-related representation. Due to the trial-and-error principle of Reinforcement Learning, this training is comparable with the traditional proceedings. In addition, valuable action paths are stored in a memory and the agent frequently is trained on these paths in order to remember good solutions. Additionally, a knowledge base is used to exclude inefficient sets of traps. The rules for the knowledge base are built upon knowledge from the conventional design process. In first test cases, the trained agent is able to assemble traps achieving promising configurations. The results of the agent will be validated in the next step using physics simulation.","Machine learning,Smart assembly,Intelligent support systems,Feeding technology",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,,"FEEDING,3D,PARTS,TRAPS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,

A series of EVC simulations were conducted based on the verified FE model to evaluate the impacts of different EVC parameters on cutting forces. The results show that the tangential force decreases with increasing vibration frequency, tangential amplitude, and thrust amplitude, but with decreasing cutting speed. The positive and negative thrust forces decrease with increasing frequency and tangential amplitude, but with decreasing thrust amplitude and cutting speed. In addition, ANOVA results clearly indicated that the tangential amplitude is the dominant parameter affecting the cutting forces, and the percent contributions to cutting forces are 69.56%, 66.03%, and 62.83%, respectively. Further, the BPNN models with three different activation functions and different architectures are utilized to predict the cutting forces, and the best performance, in terms of agreement with the target outputs, can be achieved by the network using logarithmic sigmoid activation function and architecture with 15 neurons in one hidden layer. The correlation coefficients for training and testing the selected network are 0.99993 and 0.99916, and the mean square errors are 0.1963 and 2.6070, respectively, and these reveal that BPNN is fairly successful in predicting the cutting forces.","Elliptical vibration cutting,Finite element,Analysis of variance,Back propagation neural network",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,"SURFACE-ROUGHNESS,CHIP,FORMATION,OPTIMIZATION,PARAMETERS,PREDICTION,STEEL,ANN",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,
