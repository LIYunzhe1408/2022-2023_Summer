When a researcher fabricates a novel device from a novel material system, it often takes many weeks of experimental effort and data analysis to understand why any given device/material combination produces an efficient or poorly optimized cell. It therefore takes the community tens of years to transform a promising material system to a fully optimized cell ready for production (perovskites are a contemporary example). Herein, developed is a new and rapid approach to understanding device/material performance, which uses a combination of machine learning, device modeling, and experiment. Providing a set of electrical device parameters (charge carrier mobilities, recombination rates, trap densities, etc.) in a matter of seconds thus offers a fast way to directly link fabrication conditions to device/material performance, pointing a way to further and more rapid optimization of light harvesting devices. The method is demonstrated by using it to understand annealing temperature and surfactant choice and in terms of charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells made from the P3HT:PCBM, PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PCBM, and PTB7:PCBM material systems.","charge carrier mobility,drift diffusion,machine learning,organic solar cells,thin film solar cells",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,18.125,"DENSITY-OF-STATES,MATERIALS,INFORMATICS,DATA,SCIENCE,RECOMBINATION,SPECTROSCOPY,TRANSPORT,SELECTION,VOLTAGE",ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/3486725/mackenzie.pdf,

A plain weave fiber reinforced composite material example is used to compute the initial failure strength constants of a woven lamina based on the proposed yarn failure criterion. To study the accuracy and efficiency of the failure criterion, a comparison to a meso-micro coupled model explicitly capturing the failure initiation at fiber and matrix level is performed.

8,A data-driven approach towards finding closer estimates of optimal solutions under uncertainty for an energy efficient steel casting process,189,,,"Pantula Priyanka D.,Mitra Kishalay","Pantula PD,Mitra K",Mitra K,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116253,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System),"The process of steel casting involves several energy-intensive tasks such as heat transfer, solidification process, etc. Though the evolution of continuous casting of steel from the conventional ingot casting enabled a high amount of energy savings, operational parameter optimization considering various avenues of uncertainty is the key for next level of improvement in energy efficiency and process sustainability. To achieve this, a multi-objective optimization formulation under uncertainty has been proposed that can lead to simultaneous maximization of productivity and minimization of energy consumption. Among various uncertainty handling techniques, Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient approach. However, the requirement of uncertain parameters to follow some well-behaved probability distribution for having a closed form analytical solution in CCP is a bottleneck for most of the practical situations due to the unknown nature of uncertain data. This paper proposes a novel methodology called DDCCP (Data-Driven CCP), to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP, thereby making the approach data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified accurately based on given uncertain data for more realistic sampling and thereby impacting the optimal solution accuracy. Implementing DDCCP on the casting model, similar to 20-70% improvement in the objectives of energy calculations and 50-100% improvement in the metrics of Pareto optimal solutions are observed as compared to the existing box sampling approach showing efficacy of the proposed methodology.

The machine learning methods with signal processing algorithms have been used for automated diagnosis of cardiac health using ECG signals. In this article, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with novel 1-dimensional hexadecimal local pattern (1D-HLP) technique are employed for automated detection of arrhythmia detection. The ECG signals of 10 s duration are subjected to DWT to decompose up to five levels. The 1D-HLP extracts 512 dimensional features from each level of the five levels of low pass filter. Then, these extracted features are concatenated to obtain 512 x 6 = 3072 dimensional feature set. These fused features are subjected to neighborhood component analysis (NCA) feature reduction technique to obtain 64, 128 and 256 features. Finally, these features are subjected to 1 nearest neighborhood (1NN) classifier for classification with 4 distance metrics namely city block, Euclidean, spearman and cosine. We have obtained a classification accuracy of 95.0% in classifying 17 arrhythmia classes using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia ECG dataset. Our results show that the proposed method is more superior than other already reported classical ensemble learning and deep learning methods for arrhythmia detection using ECG signals.

We look more into the techniques involved in each step of wearable sensor modality centred HAR in terms of sensors, activities, data pre-processing, feature learning and classification, including both conventional approaches and deep learning methods. In the feature learning section, we focus on both hand-crafted features and automatically learned features using deep networks.

High-resolution 2D/3D imaging of shale rocks for the purpose of establishing their mineralogy, total, and connected porosities has become more and more sophisticated. In this paper, nanoscale-resolution focused ion beam (FIB)-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) nano-tomography was used to obtain images of pore structures within two organic-rich regions of interest (ROIs), selected based on correlative SEM and automated mineralogy maps. Advanced machine learning classification tools were used to segment the images and assign porosities and other components. Pore size distribution and pore connectivity analyzes revealed that about 95% of all the pores, present within the two ROIs, had a diameter of less than approximately 75 nm, and that most of these pores were poorly connected. In a similar fashion, the flow rate distribution analysis showed that pores with diameters of about 150-330 nm contributed to over 50% of the flow capacity of the connected pore systems. These results suggest that although most of the pores typically found in shales have pore diameter smaller than about 100 nm, most of the hydrocarbon production may be carried by a relatively small number of larger connected pores with pore diameter greater than about 150 nm. This study implies that a large portion of the organic-hosted pores (with diameter typically smaller than about 100 nm) may not provide permeable flow pathways for the oil and/or gas migration, and hence may have very little contribution to the hydrocarbon production.","Porosity and permeability of shales,Multi-scale imaging,Correlative microscopy,Digital rock,Vaca Muerta Shale",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,6.63,"THERMAL,MATURITY,METHANE,ADSORPTION,GAS,SHALES,POROSITY,WOODFORD,BARNETT,MULTISCALE,MARCELLUS,STORAGE",FUEL,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1594054,

When predicting in situ nanoparticle size based on trajectory datasets, neural networks achieved a 0.90 recall score compared to 0.83 using an optimized Stokes-Einstein predictor. To distinguish between nanoparticles of different sizes in more complex nanoparticle mixtures, our neural network achieved up to a recall score of 0.85. Even in cases of more nuanced output variables where mathematical models are not available, such as protein adhesion, neural networks retained the ability to distinguish between particle populations (recall score of 0.89).

Methods The proposed system employs butterfly-type networks (BtrflyNets) for skeleton segmentation and extraction of hot spots of bone metastatic lesions, in which a pair of anterior and posterior images are processed simultaneously. BSI is then measured using the segmented bones and extracted hot spots. To further improve the networks, deep supervision (DSV) and residual learning technologies were introduced. Results We evaluated the performance of the proposed system using 246 bone scintigrams of prostate cancer in terms of accuracy of skeleton segmentation, hot spot extraction, and BSI measurement, as well as computational cost.

Commonly, they are calibrated by correlating their signals with reference instrument measurements and using a machine learning model to account for the influence of air properties. As particle properties vary over location, such calibration models are only relevant to measurements made at the calibration location during a limited time period. For a more general operation of these sensors it is critical that their measurement performance is established using the calibration approaches commonly for research grade instruments. Without loss the generality, here we conducted an experimental study with size-classified, composition and concentration varied particles to determine the response function of a popular low-cost sensor, Plantower PMS5003. The sensor response in all the size channels is analyzed using Tikhonov regularization and quadratic programing method with the constraints of nonnegative and monotonic response with particle size. We show that the shape of the response function is closely related to the light scattering response, consistent with what might be expected for an optical sensor. The response function shows that signals in all size channels have a complex dependence on particle material and size distribution. Accurate determination of particle mass and number distributions from the sensor signals in different channels is, thus, not straightforward. The response function calculation is validated by comparing sensor measured and predicted signals using polydispersed particles. The obtained response functions provide critical insight into the operation of a popular low-cost sensor and guidance on interpretation of its results.

In this study, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy have been applied to human hip samples in order to characterize differences between cartilage and adjacent subchondral bone tissue. Mathematical decomposition of absorption and scattering properties is an important aspect in diffuse reflectance data analysis. Here, we present the novel application of Bayesian statistics to this analysis, which can extract probability density spectra of the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient. Using this concept of a Bayesian decomposition algorithm for the spectral decomposition, it was possible to find characteristic differences in the relative concentration of melanin and haemoglobin as well as in scattering properties. Furthermore, this allowed a reconstruction of probability density plots for scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient instead of singular values. Complemented by the results of Raman spectroscopy, it was further possible to detect significant differences in the ratio of minerals (such as hydroxyl apatite) to bio-molecules (such as proteins) when comparing bony tissue regions to the surrounding cartilage. Finally, it was possible to use these molecular contrast mechanisms for highly-accurate, automated tissue classification using machine learning algorithms on the level of individual patients.","Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,Raman spectroscopy,Bayesian inference,Bone,Cartilage,Label-free,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA, PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Electrochemistry,Instruments & Instrumentation",,6.743,"INDUCED,BREAKDOWN,SPECTROSCOPY,FEMOROACETABULAR,IMPINGEMENT,EX-VIVO,HIP,OSTEOARTHRITIS,TISSUE,DIFFERENTIATION,IDENTIFICATION,INJURIES,SPECTRA",SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL,,

Assisted reproductive technology has been proven capable of alleviating infertility issues. In vitro fertilisation is one such option whose success is highly dependent on the selection of a high-quality embryo for transfer. This is typically done manually by analysing embryos under a microscope. However, evidence has shown that the success rate of manual selection remains low. The use of new incubators with integrated time-lapse imaging system is providing new possibilities for embryo assessment. As such, we address this problem by proposing an approach based on deep learning for automated embryo quality evaluation through the analysis of time-lapse images. Automatic embryo detection is complicated by the topological changes of a tracked object. Moreover, the algorithm should process a large number of image files of different qualities in a reasonable amount of time. Methods We propose an automated approach to detect human embryo development stages during incubation and to highlight embryos with abnormal behaviour by focusing on five different stages. This method encompasses two major steps. First, the location of an embryo in the image is detected by employing a Haar feature-based cascade classifier and leveraging the radiating lines. Then, a multi-class prediction model is developed to identify a total cell number in the embryo using the technique of deep learning. Results The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of at least 90% in the detection of embryo location. The implemented deep learning approach to identify the early stages of embryo development resulted in an overall accuracy of over 92% using the selected architectures of convolutional neural networks. The most problematic stage was the 3-cell stage, presumably due to its short duration during development. Conclusion This research contributes to the field by proposing a model to automate the monitoring of early-stage human embryo development. Unlike in other imaging fields, only a few published attempts have involved leveraging deep learning in this field. Therefore, the approach presented in this study could be used in the creation of novel algorithms integrated into the assisted reproductive technology used by embryologists.","Deep learning,Location detection,Embryo development,Image recognition,Multi-class prediction",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Engineering,,2.905,"LIVE,BIRTH-RATE,CLASSIFICATION,FEATURES",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6909649?pdf=render,

In particular, medical specialists refer to the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - sponsored revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) that is the most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity. Methods In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according to MDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects. In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution. Results Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity. Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy). Conclusions The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in the assessment and rating of PD patients in a real clinical scenario.","Classification,Artificial neural network,Support vector machine,Feature selection,Parkinson's disease,Gait analysis,Finger tapping,Foot tapping,MDS-UPDRS,Microsoft kinect v2",Article; Proceedings Paper,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Medical Informatics,,3.394,"GAIT,NETWORKS,BRADYKINESIA,OPTIMIZATION,PREDICTION,TREMOR",BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6907109,

A novel approach is proposed which is based on modeling of configurational spaces (CSs) and full sets of inequivalent migration pathways by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML) techniques. A 2 x 1 X 1 supercell (32 formula units) of a low-temperature polymorph of the KFeO2 compound with space group symmetry Pbca was used. For the three lowest Ti contents (x = 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09), all symmetrically inequivalent configurations of atomic arrangements (CSs) and K+ migration pathways (total numbers: 128, 59520, and 8630400) were generated. With the DFT-derived energetics of K+ migration at the lowest doping level (x = 0.03), the ML models were trained to predict ionic transport properties by using geometrical descriptors for the pathway-dopant arrangement. The trained ML models were then used to evaluate the K+ migration properties for pathways at higher doping levels. The computational results obtained are in good agreement with the results of a previous experimental study of the title compound. This demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach for modeling and predicting effects of doping in crystalline solids, such as solid electrolytes and intercalation cathodes. Brief recommendations are given on the application of the proposed combined approach.","CATHODE MATERIALS,CONDUCTORS,CONDUCTIVITY,BATTERIES,MIGRATION,SEARCH",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.467,"CATHODE,MATERIALS,CONDUCTORS,CONDUCTIVITY,BATTERIES,MIGRATION,SEARCH",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,,

We carried out a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and the proportion of time that heart rate and respiratory rate can be estimated from preterm infants using only a video camera in a clinical environment, without interfering with regular patient care. A total of 426.6 h of video and reference vital signs were recorded for 90 sessions from 30 preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Each preterm infant was recorded under regular ambient light during daytime for up to four consecutive days. We developed multi-task deep learning algorithms to automatically segment skin areas and to estimate vital signs only when the infant was present in the field of view of the video camera and no clinical interventions were undertaken. We propose signal quality assessment algorithms for both heart rate and respiratory rate to discriminate between clinically acceptable and noisy signals. The mean absolute error between the reference and camera-derived heart rates was 2.3 beats/min for over 76% of the time for which the reference and camera data were valid. The mean absolute error between the reference and camera-derived respiratory rate was 3.5 breaths/min for over 82% of the time. Accurate estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate could be derived for at least 90% of the time, if gaps of up to 30 seconds with no estimates were allowed.","HEART-RATE,RESPIRATORY RATE,BREATHING PATTERNS,TERM INFANTS,ECG,TECHNOLOGY,FUSION,SLEEP,BIRTH,RATES",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,11.665,"HEART-RATE,RESPIRATORY,RATE,BREATHING,PATTERNS,TERM,INFANTS,ECG,TECHNOLOGY,FUSION,SLEEP,BIRTH,RATES",NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6908711?pdf=render,

The gain in learning is higher when what is learned is reflected by others in a cooperative process. The Class Peer Review (CPR) requires from students to evaluate each other but lecturers lose a lot of time when applying it during the lecture. Research on CPR shows many different approaches to how this method should be carried out effectively and many of them still demand a high presence of the lecturer. In contrast to most studies, this article reports the results of a CPR conducted outside the classroom and assisted by a web-supported role playing game representing a publisher where a common online class journal is used as an incentive and motivational element. The effectiveness of CPR was examined by means of a quasi-experimental study. It turned out that the experimental group used the training software significantly more frequently in addition to the lecture materials and a meaningful increase in group dynamics was recorded. Also female students were more motivated to continue this type of group work in the future. Final grades were better under CPR conditions, but the effect was statistically weak. Basically, the CPR method seems to be an effective tool to extend problem-based teaching to the self-learning phase if practiced in combinaktion with a role play and fictive Class-Journals as incentive.

Within this context, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the amplitudes and center frequencies of selected stop and pass bands inside the Floquet-Bloch spectra of the acoustic metamaterials featured by a chiral or antichiral microstructure. Novel functional applications of such research are expected in the optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters and directional waveguides. The present paper deals with the maximization of the amplitude of low-frequency band gaps, by proposing suitable numerical techniques to solve the associated optimization problems. Specifically, the feasibility and effectiveness of Radial Basis Function networks and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for the interpolation of the objective functions of such optimization problems are discussed, and their numerical application to a specific acoustic metamaterial with tetrachiral microstructure is presented. The discussion is motivated theoretically by the high computational effort often needed for an exact evaluation of the objective functions arising in band gap optimization problems, when iterative algorithms are used for their approximate solution. By replacing such functions with suitable surrogate objective functions constructed applying machine-learning techniques, well-performing suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational effort. Numerical results demonstrate the effective potential of the proposed approach.

This flexibility can be computationally captured by changing the learning rate in a reinforcement-learning model. Key components of reinforcement learning-such as prediction error (delta), learning rate (alpha), and reward feedback (r)-have been mapped to various brain areas. However, questions regarding the functional integration patterns in the human brain under the modulation of learning factors, and their interactions, remain unanswered. To investigate these phenomena, we first applied a reinforcement-learning model with an adaptive learning rate and functional magnetic resonance imaging to simulate the individual's reward-learning behavior. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was then used to examine the functional interactions of the whole brain under the experimental condition of reward (r), the integration between reward and learning rate (alpha x r), and the integration between the prediction error and learning rate (alpha x delta) in a reward-learning task. The behavior statistical analyses indicated that the model estimates of alpha and delta captured the participants' learning behavioral patterns of getting high reward, by changing alpha and delta for different difficulties and after getting different reward feedback. The PPI analysis results showed that motor-related regions (including the supplement motor area, precentral gyrus, and thalamus) contributed to cognitive control processing regions (including the middle temporal gyrus, anterior and middle cingulate gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus) by alpha x r. Finally, alpha x delta modulated the interaction between subregions of the striatum.","adaptive reward learning,functional magnetic resonance imaging,learning rate,prediction error,psychophysiological interaction analysis",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,2.03,"MEDIAL,FRONTAL-CORTEX,PREDICTION,ERRORS,REINFORCEMENT,MECHANISMS,SIGNALS,MODEL,FMRI",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ima.22387,

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation -0.546; p= 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying passive biosensor measurement techniques to monitor disability in MS patients both in clinic and in the free-living setting.","PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,ACCELEROMETRY,DISABILITY,VALIDITY,MOBILITY,MONITORS,FATIGUE,GAIT",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,11.665,"PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY,ACCELEROMETRY,DISABILITY,VALIDITY,MOBILITY,MONITORS,FATIGUE,GAIT",NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0197-7.pdf,

Data evaluation is computationally expensive, vulnerable to artifacts, and often sensitive to fit algorithm parameters. In this work, we investigate whether neural networks can provide not only fast model fitting results, but also a quality metric for the predicted values, so called uncertainty quantification, investigated here in the context of multi-pool Lorentzian fitting of CEST MRI spectra at 3T. Methods A deep feed-forward neural network including a probabilistic output layer allowing for uncertainty quantification was set up to take uncorrected CEST-spectra as input and predict 3T Lorentzian parameters of a 4-pool model (water, semisolid MT, amide CEST, NOE CEST), including the B-0 inhomogeneity. Networks were trained on data from 3 subjects with and without data augmentation, and applied to untrained data from 1 additional subject and 1 brain tumor patient. Comparison to conventional Lorentzian fitting was performed on different perturbations of input data. Results The deepCEST 3T networks provided fast and accurate predictions of all Lorentzian parameters and were robust to input perturbations because of noise or B-0 artifacts. The uncertainty quantification detected fluctuations in input data by increase of the uncertainty intervals. The method generalized to unseen brain tumor patient CEST data. Conclusions The deepCEST 3T neural network provides fast and robust estimation of CEST parameters, enabling online reconstruction of sophisticated CEST contrast images without the typical computational cost.

Adaptive Bayesian optimization is demonstrated here as a valuable support tool in increasing both the per-batch yield and quality of short polymer fibers, produced by wet spinning and shear dispersion methods. Through this approach, it is shown that short fiber dispersions with high yield and a specified, targeted fiber length distribution can be obtained with minimal cost of optimization, starting from sub-optimal processing conditions and minimal prior knowledge. The Bayesian function optimization demonstrated here for batch processing could be applied to other dynamic scale-up methods as well as to cases presenting higher dimensional challenges such as shape and structure optimization. This work shows the great potential of synergies between industrial processing, material engineering, and machine learning perspectives.","SCALE-UP,CHALLENGES,GRAPHENE",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,3.613,"SCALE-UP,CHALLENGES,GRAPHENE",ACS OMEGA,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6906790?pdf=render,

In detail, the correlation between features and the correlation between class labels are combined into a new uniform feature space. After that, the MDMR algorithm is used to select the most discriminatory features from the new uniform feature space, which is helpful to reduce the data dimensionality. Lastly, a KNN-like algorithm is modified to calculate the label similarity of test data, and the finite set of labels of test data is predicted by ML-KNN.

Unlike object detection in natural images, the detection of medical abnormalities is unique because they often locate in tiny local regions within a high-resolution medical image. Traditional machine learning approaches build sliding windowbased detectors with manual features and are therefore limited on both efficiency and accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning shed new light on this problem, but applying it to medical image analysis faces challenges including insufficient data. Training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly on high-resolution images requires image compression at the input layer, which leads to the loss of information that is essential for medical abnormality detection. Therefore, instead of training on full images, the proposed approach first fine-tunes the pre-trained deep CNNs on image patches centered at medical abnormalities and then integrates them with class activation mappings and region proposal networks for building abnormality detectors. The deep patch classifier has been tested on a mammogram data set and achieved an overall classification accuracy of 92.53%, compared to 81.55% by a traditional approach using manual features. The integrated detector has been tested on an ultrasound liver image data set for abnormality detection and achieved an average precision of 0.60, outperforming both the sliding window-based approach of 0.16 and a deep learning YOLO model of 0.51. These validations suggest that the integrated approach has great potential for assisting doctors in detecting abnormalities from medical images.","Medical abnormality detection,Deep convolutional neural networks,Class activation mapping,Region proposal networks",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Computer Science,,2.081,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DIAGNOSIS,MICROCALCIFICATION,CLUSTERS,CLASSIFICATION,LESIONS,MASS,FILTER",VISUAL COMPUTER,,

We collected clinical and laboratory data, as well as information on arterial stiffness parameters using arterial tonometry and measurements from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e., Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model, calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and PWV.

SPED data from nanocrystalline materials commonly contain some PED patterns in which diffraction is measured from multiple crystals. To analyse such data, it is important to perform nanocrystal segmentation to isolate both the location of each crystal and a corresponding representative diffraction signal. This also reduces data dimensionality significantly. Here, two approaches to nanocrystal segmentation are presented, the first based on virtual dark-field imaging and the second on non-negative matrix factorization. Relative merits and limitations are compared in application to SPED data obtained from partly overlapping nanoparticles, and particular challenges are highlighted associated with crystals exciting the same diffraction conditions. It is demonstrated that both strategies can be used for nanocrystal segmentation without prior knowledge of the crystal structures present, but also that segmentation artefacts can arise and must be considered carefully. The analysis workflows associated with this work are provided open-source. Lay Description Scanning precession electron diffraction is an electron microscopy technique that enables studies of the local crystallography of a broad selection of materials on the nanoscale. The technique involves the acquisition of a two-dimensional diffraction pattern for every probe position in an area of the sample. The four-dimensional dataset collected by this technique can typically comprise up to 500 000 diffraction patterns. For nanocrystalline materials, it is common that single diffraction patterns contain signals from overlapping crystals. To process such data, we use nanocrystal segmentation, where a representative diffraction pattern is constructed for each individual crystal, together with a real space image showing its morphology and location in the data. This reduces the dimensionality of the data and allows unmixing of signals from overlapping crystals. In this work, we demonstrate two methods for nanocrystal segmentation, one based on creating virtual dark-field images, and one based on unsupervised machine learning. A model system of partly overlapping nanoparticles is used to demonstrate the segmentation, and a demanding case for segmentation is highlighted, where some crystals are not discernible based on their diffraction patterns. To obtain a more complete nanocrystal segmentation, we add an image segmentation routine to both methods, and we discuss benefits and limitations of the two methods. The demonstration data and the used code are provided open-source, so that it can be used by everyone for analysis of nanocrystalline materials or as a starting point for further development of nanocrystal segmentation in scanning precession electron diffraction data.","Nanoparticles,non-negative matrix factorization,open-source,scanning precession electron diffraction,virtual dark-field imaging,watershed segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Microscopy,,1.855,ORIENTATION,JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/11250/2638614/4/Bergh.pdf,

We argue that modelling should be utilised more frequently in the design of BGs to achieve properties such as high bioactivity, high fracture strength and toughness, low density, and controlled morphology. Another challenge is modelling the biological response to biomaterials, such as their ability to foster protein adsorption, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and bactericidal effects. The development of databases integrated with robust computational tools will be indispensable to these efforts.

The present study provides an artificial neural network (ANN) model for mapping of soil nail bond strength. The ANN model is trained, validated, and tested using 522 nail bond strength data contained in Hong Kong soil nail pullout database and is publically accessible in the literature. The accuracy of the developed ANN model is examined and compared with the default ESM. The results showed that ANN model is accurate on average and the predicted dispersion is low.

Key features of the framework include two aspects: (1) determining the bonded interactions via the iterative Boltzmann inversion method to emulate the local structures of the epoxies and, (2) optimizing the nonbonded interaction potentials through the machine-learning approach to reproduce the mechanical properties. Such machine-learning based technique is computationally efficient in searching for the optimal solution of nonbonded potential parameters and enables the CG model to become transferable within a wide range of cross-linking degrees. This is mainly attributed to the fact that ANN can give good predictions based on training database obtained from CG simulations and thus greatly accelerates the PSO algorithm in achieving the optimal solution. On the basis of the DOC-transferable CG model, the cohesive interaction strength is phenomenologically adjusted to preserve the temperature-dependent properties. The CG model allows the mechanical properties of cross-linked epoxies to be predicted with reasonable accuracy over wide ranges of cross-linking degrees and temperature.

The grading system is based on the architectural pattern of cancerous epithelium in histological images. However, the standard procedure of histological examination often involves complicated tissue fixation and staining, which are time-consuming and may delay the diagnosis and surgery. In this study, label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to acquire subcellular-resolution images of unstained prostate tissues. Then, a deep learning architecture (U-net) was introduced for epithelium segmentation of prostate tissues in MPM images. The obtained segmentation results were then merged with the original MPM images to train a classification network (AlexNet) for automated Gleason grading. The developed method achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 92.3% with a mean F1 score of 0.839 for epithelium segmentation. By merging the segmentation results with the MPM images, the accuracy of Gleason grading was improved from 72.42% to 81.13% in hold-out test set. Our results suggest that MPM in combination with deep learning holds the potential to be used as a fast and powerful clinical tool for PCa diagnosis.","deep learning,epithelium segmentation,Gleason Grading,multiphoton microscopy,prostate cancer",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biophysics,Optics",,3.403,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,2ND-HARMONIC,GENERATION,OVARIAN-CANCER,HISTOPATHOLOGY,STAIN,VIVO,TOOL",JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS,,

As tumors and fibrosis have similar visual and tactile feedback, they are hard to distinguish during surgery. To prevent positive resection margins during surgery and spare healthy tissue, it would be of great benefit to have a real-time tissue classification technology that can be used in vivo. Study Design/Materials and Methods In this study diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was evaluated for real-time tissue classification of tumor and fibrosis. DRS spectra of fibrosis and tumor were obtained on excised rectal specimens. After normalization using the area under the curve, a support vector machine was trained using a 10-fold cross-validation. Results Using spectra of pure tumor tissue and pure fibrosis tissue, we obtained a mean accuracy of 0.88. This decreased to a mean accuracy of 0.61 when tumor measurements were used in which a layer of healthy tissue, mainly fibrosis, was present between the tumor and the measurement surface. Conclusion It is possible to distinguish pure fibrosis from pure tumor. However, when the measurements on tumor also involve fibrotic tissue, the classification accuracy decreases. Lasers Surg. Med.

In this study, to exploit the e2e-property of deep learning models, a novel GDL methodology is proposed where only minimal objective-free preprocessing steps are needed. Furthermore, to deal with the complicated multi-class MI-EEG signals, an innovative multilevel GDL-based classifying scheme is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed model and its robustness against noisy MI-EEG signals is evaluated using two different GDL models, that is, deep belief network and stacked sparse autoencoder in e2e manner.

We investigated the influence of IMU position and orientation placement errors on GRF estimation accuracy. Methods: Kinematic data from twelve healthy subjects based on marker trajectories were used to simulate 1848 combinations of sensor position placement errors (range +/- 100 mm) and orientation placement errors (range +/- 25 degrees) across eight body segments (trunk, pelvis, left/right thighs, left/right shanks, and left/ right feet) during normal walking trials for baseline cases when a single sensor was misplaced and for the extreme cases when all sensors were simultaneously misplaced. Three machine learning algorithms were used to estimate GRF for each placement error condition and compared with the no placement error condition to evaluate performance. Results: Position placement errors for a single misplaced IMU reduced vertical GRF (VGRF), medio-lateral GRF (MLGRF), and anterior-posterior GRF (APGRF) estimation accuracy by up to 1.1%, 2.0%, and 0.9%, respectively and for all eight simultaneously misplaced IMUs by up to 4.9%, 6.0%, and 4.3%, respectively. Orientation placement errors for a single misplaced IMU reduced VGRF, MLGRF, and APGRF estimation accuracy by up to 4.8%, 7.3%, and 1.5%, respectively and for all eight simultaneously misplaced IMUs by up to 20.8%, 23.4%, and 123%, respectively. Conclusion: IMU sensor misplacement, particularly orientation placement errors, can significantly reduce GRF estimation accuracy and thus measures should be taken to account for placement errors in implementations of GRF estimation via wearable IMUs.

In many big data systems, iterative re-training high dimensional data from scratch is computationally infeasible since constant data stream ingestion on top of a historical data pool increases the training time exponentially. Therefore, the need arises on how to retain past learning and fast update the model incrementally based on the new data. Also, the current machine learning approaches do the model prediction without providing a comprehensive root cause analysis. To resolve these limitations, our framework lays foundations on an ensemble process between stream data with historical batch data for an incremental lifelong learning (LML) model.Case descriptionA cancer patient's pathological tests like blood, DNA, urine or tissue analysis provide a unique signature based on the DNA combinations. Our analysis allows personalized and targeted medications and achieves a therapeutic response. Model is evaluated through data from The National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons unified data repository. The aim is to prescribe personalized medicine based on the thousands of genotype and phenotype parameters for each patient.Discussion and evaluationThe model uses a dimension reduction method to reduce training time at an online sliding window setting. We identify the Gleason score as a determining factor for cancer possibility and substantiate our claim through Lilliefors and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We present clustering and Random Decision Forest results. The model's prediction accuracy is compared with standard machine learning algorithms for numeric and categorical fields.ConclusionWe propose an ensemble framework of stream and batch data for incremental lifelong learning. The framework successively applies first streaming clustering technique and then Random Decision Forest Regressor/Classifier to isolate anomalous patient data and provides reasoning through root cause analysis by feature correlations with an aim to improve the overall survival rate. While the stream clustering technique creates groups of patient profiles, RDF further drills down into each group for comparison and reasoning for useful actionable insights. The proposed MALA architecture retains the past learned knowledge and transfer to future learning and iteratively becomes more knowledgeable over time.","Lifelong learning,Real-time data processing,Lambda Architecture,Streaming k-means,Random Decision Forest,Dimension reduction",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,,,JOURNAL OF BIG DATA,https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40537-019-0261-9,

The goal of this study was to develop a novel approach based on the generative adversarial networks for fully automatic segmentation of knee cartilage and meniscus. Theory and Methods Defining proper loss function for semantic segmentation to enforce the learning of multiscale spatial constraints in an end-to-end training process is an open problem. In this work, we have used the conditional generative adversarial networks to improve segmentation performance of convolutional neural network, such as UNet alone by overcoming the problems caused by pixel-wise mapping based objective functions, and to capture cartilage features during the training of the network. Furthermore, the Dice coefficient and cross entropy losses were incorporated to the loss functions to improve the model performance. The model was trained and tested on 176, 3D DESS (double-echo steady-state) knee images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative data set. Results The proposed model provided excellent segmentation performance for cartilages with Dice coefficients ranging from 0.84 in patellar cartilage to 0.91 in lateral tibial cartilage, with an average Dice coefficient of 0.88. For meniscus segmentation, the model achieves 0.89 Dice coefficient for lateral meniscus and 0.87 Dice coefficient for medial meniscus.

However, due to hardware limitations, the existed hyper-/multi-spectral imaging devices usually cannot obtain high spatial resolution. This study aims to generate a high resolution hyperspectral image according to the available low resolution hyperspectral and high resolution RGB images. We propose a novel hyperspectral image superresolution method via non-negative sparse representation of reflectance spectra with a data guided sparsity constraint. The proposed method firstly learns the hyperspectral dictionary from the low resolution hyperspectral image and then transforms it into the RGB one with the camera response function, which is decided by the physical property of the RGB imaging camera. Given the RGB vector and the RGB dictionary, the sparse representation of each pixel in the high resolution image is calculated with the guidance of a sparsity map, which measures pixel material purity. The sparsity map is generated by analyzing the local content similarity of a focused pixel in the available high resolution RGB image and quantifying the spectral mixing degree motivated by the fact that the pixel spectrum of a pure material should have sparse representation of the spectral dictionary. Since the proposed method adaptively adjusts the sparsity in the spectral representation based on the local content of the available high resolution RGB image, it can produce more robust spectral representation for recovering the target high resolution hyperspectral image. Comprehensive experiments on two public hyperspectral datasets and three real remote sensing images validate that the proposed method achieves promising performances compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.","hyperspectral image superresolution,sparse representation,data guided sparsity,spectral mixing,local content similarity",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"CLASSIFICATION,RESOLUTION",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6960746?pdf=render,

EEG signal analysis revealed a high negative peak with a maximum averaged amplitude of -14.75 +/- 5.99 mu V, occurring at 62 ms after postural perturbation. The xDAWN algorithm was used to reduce the high-dimension of EEG signal features. And, Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to train a classifier. The detection rate of the falling-risk onset is 98.67%. And the detection latency is 334ms, when we set detection rate beyond 90% as the standard of dangerous event onset.

In the medical field, HSI has commonly been investigated due to its great potential for diagnostic and surgical guidance purposes. However, the large amount of information provided by HSI normally contains redundant or non-relevant information, and it is extremely important to identify the most relevant wavelengths for a certain application in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions and reduce the execution time of the classification algorithm. Additionally, some wavelengths can contain noise and removing such bands can improve the classification stage. The work presented in this paper aims to identify such relevant spectral ranges in the visual-and-near-infrared (VNIR) region for an accurate detection of brain cancer using in vivo hyperspectral images. A methodology based on optimization algorithms has been proposed for this task, identifying the relevant wavelengths to achieve the best accuracy in the classification results obtained by a supervised classifier (support vector machines), and employing the lowest possible number of spectral bands.

Comparing performance of ML models used in various studies can be problematic due to different walking protocols and gait assessment systems. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of walking protocols and gait assessment systems on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) for classification of PD. 93 PD and 103 controls performed two walking protocols at their normal pace: (i) four times along a 10 m walkway (intermittent walk-IW), (ii) walking for 2 minutes on a 25 m oval circuit (continuous walk-CW). 14 gait characteristics were extracted from two different systems (an instrumented walkway-GAITRite; and an accelerometer attached at the lower back-Axivity). SVM and RF were trained on normalized data (accounting for step velocity, gender, age and BMI) and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation with area under the curve (AUC). Overall performance was higher for both systems during CW compared to IW. SVM performed better than RF. With SVM, during CW Axivity significantly outperformed GAITRite (AUC: 87.83 +/- 7.81% vs. 80.49 +/- 9.85%); during IW systems performed similarly. These findings suggest that choice of testing protocol and sensing system may have a direct impact on ML PD classification results and highlight the need for standardization for wide scale implementation.","Parkinson's disease,machine learning,classification,wearables,accelerometer,GAITRite,multi-regression normalization,SVM,random forest classifier",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"GAITRITE%28R%29,WALKWAY,SYSTEM,QUALITY-OF-LIFE,OLDER-ADULTS,RATING-SCALE,SPEED,PARAMETERS,ACCELEROMETER,PROGRESSION,VALIDATION,SELECTION",SENSORS,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/62685/1/Comparison%20of%20walking%20protocols%20and%20gait%20assessment%20systems%20for%20machine%20learning-based%20classification%20of%20Parkinson%E2%80%99s%20disease.pdf,

Based on combined photoplethysmography and electrocardiogram signals, this study aimed to extract the waveform information, introduce individual characteristics, and construct systolic and diastolic blood-pressure (SBP and DBP) estimation models using the back-propagation error (BP) neural network. During the model construction process, the mean impact value method was employed to investigate the impact of each feature on the model output and reduce feature redundancy. Moreover, the multiple population genetic algorithm was applied to optimize the BP neural network and determine the initial weights and threshold of the network. Finally, the models were integrated for further optimization to generate the final individualized continuous blood-pressure monitoring models. The results showed that the predicted values of the model in this study correlated significantly with the measured values of the electronic sphygmomanometer.

Results We present a unified hybrid self-attention deep learning framework, namely HybridAtt, to automatically classify sleep stages by capturing channel and temporal correlations from multivariate PSG records. We construct a new multi-view convolutional representation module to learn channel-specific and global view features from the heterogeneous PSG inputs. The hybrid attention mechanism is designed to further fuse the multi-view features by inferring their dependencies without any additional supervision. The learned attentional representation is subsequently fed through a softmax layer to train an end-to-end deep learning model. Conclusions We empirically evaluate our proposed HybridAtt model on a benchmark PSG dataset in two feature domains, referred to as the time and frequency domains.

Producing bimetal parts using a single-point incremental forming process (SPIF) has increased recently with the development of industrial requirements. Such types of sheets have multiple functions that are not applicable in the case of monolithic sheets. In this study, the correlation between the operating variables, the maximum forming angle, and the surface roughness is established based on the ensemble learning using gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT). In order to obtain the dataset for the machine learning, a series of experiments with continuous variable angle pyramid shape were carried out based on D-Optimal design. This design is created based on numerical variables (i.e., tool diameter, step size, and feed rate) and categorical variable (i.e., layer arrangement). The grid search cross-validation (CV) method was used to determine the optimum GBRT parameters prior to model training. After the parameter tuning and model selection, the model with a better generalization performance is obtained. The reliability of the predictive models is confirmed by the testing samples. Furthermore, the microstructure of the aluminum/stainless steel (Al/SUS) bimetal sheet is analyzed under different levels of operating parameters and layer arrangements. The microstructure results reveal that severe cracks are attained in the case of a small tool diameter while a clear refinement is observed when a high tool diameter value with small step down is used for both Al and SUS layers.","incremental forming,maximum forming angle,surface roughness,microstructure,gradient boosting,Al,SUS bimetal sheet",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Physics",,3.92,"OPTIMIZATION,STEEL,FORMABILITY,PARAMETERS,METAL",MATERIALS,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/24/4150/pdf,

The dynamic response was studied in terms of displacement-frequency variation. The response of both unreinforced and reinforced conditions was studied under six different dynamic force levels. From the experimental results, the significant improvement in the machine foundation performance was observed in the presence of geogrid reinforcement. The formulations for predicting displacement amplitude were developed using ANN and GP. In the formulation, depth of placement of geogrid, eccentric angle, the natural frequency of foundation soil system, damping ratio, shear strain, shear modulus and the operating frequency of a machine were considered as input variables. Primarily, the statistical performance of the models was compared through different performance indices. In addition, different algorithms were described to identify the ranking of influencing parameters, which affect the dynamic response of a geogrid reinforced bed. From the analysis, the resonant parameters predicted from the models have shown good agreement with the field test results.

Methods: In a retrospective review of clinical spinal MRI database with a dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) sequence, a total of 61 patients without prior cancer diagnosis and later confirmed to have metastases (30 lung; 31 non-lung cancers) were identified. For hot-spot analysis, a manual ROI was placed to calculate three heuristic parameters from the wash-in, maximum, and wash-out phases in the DCE kinetics. For each case, the 3D tumor mask was generated by using the normalized-cut algorithm. Radiomics analysis was performed to extract histogram and texture features from three DCE parametric maps. Deep learning was performed using these maps as inputs into a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as using all 12 sets of DCE images into a convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) network.
Results: For hot-spot ROI analysis, mean wash-out slope was 0.25 +/- 10% for lung metastases and -9.8 +/- 12.9% for other tumors. CHAID classification using a wash-out slope of -6.6% followed by wash-in enhancement ratio of 98% achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79.

But as of today, none of these ML-based methods have shown conclusive performances or have been adopted as a de facto solution to tractography. One reason for this might be the lack of well-defined and extensive frameworks to train, evaluate, and compare these methods.
In this paper, we describe several datasets and evaluation tools that contain useful features for ML algorithms, along with the various methods proposed in the recent years. We then discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate and compare those methods, as well as their shortcomings. Finally, we describe the particular needs of ML tractography methods and discuss tangible solutions for future works.","Diffusion MRI,Tractography,Machine learning,Benchmark",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"STANDARDIZED,EVALUATION,DIFFUSION,SEGMENTATION,CONNECTOME,RECONSTRUCTION,FRAMEWORK,PROTOCOL,RICIAN,NOISE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05568,

The hypothesis is that TA features may reflect histological abnormalities underlying PAS in patients with PP thus helping in differentiating positive from negative cases.
Materials and methods: Pre-operative MRI examinations of 64 patients with PP of which 20 positive (12 accreta, 7 increta and 1 percreta) and 44 negative for PAS were retrospectively selected. Multiple (n = 3) rounded regions of interest (ROIs) were manually positioned on sagittal or coronal T2-weighted images over homogeneous placental tissue close to the placental-myometrial interface for each patient to extract TA features. After balancing the dataset with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, training and testing sets were obtained using Hold-out with a 75/25% split. Different algorithms were applied on the training set using the wrapper method, which looks for the best combination of features based on the optimization of a heuristic function in order to get the highest accuracy, and a 10-fold Cross-validation. The accuracy of the best models was also assessed on the test set. Histology was used as the standard of reference.
Results: A total of 192 ROIs were positioned and a ROI-based analysis was then conducted. Among the different algorithms, k-nearest neighbors obtained the highest accuracy (98.1%), precision (98.7%), sensitivity (97.5%) and specificity (98.7%) while exploiting the lowest number of features (n = 26); conversely, the Naive Bayes algorithm got the lowest scores showing an accuracy of 80.5%.
Conclusion: ML analysis using MRI-derived TA features could be a feasible tool in the identification of placental tissue abnormalities underlying PAS in patients with PP. This approach might represent an additional tool in the clinical practice, thus expanding the application field of artificial intelligence to medical images.","Placenta accrete spectrum,MRI,Texture analysis,Radiomics,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"FIGO,CONSENSUS,GUIDELINES,DIAGNOSIS,ACCURACY",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,,

It has been shown that even when care is taken to standardize acquisitions, any changes in hardware, software, or protocol design can lead to differences in quantitative results. This greatly impacts the quantitative utility of MRI in multi-site or long-term studies, where consistency is often valued over image quality. We propose a method of contrast harmonization, called DeepHarmony, which uses a U-Net-based deep learning architecture to produce images with consistent contrast. To provide training data, a small overlap cohort (n = 8) was scanned using two different protocols. Images harmonized with DeepHarmony showed significant improvement in consistency of volume quantification between scanning protocols. A longitudinal MRI dataset of patients with multiple sclerosis was also used to evaluate the effect of a protocol change on atrophy calculations in a clinical research setting. The results show that atrophy calculations were substantially and significantly affected by protocol change, whereas such changes have a less significant effect and substantially reduced overall difference when using DeepHarmony. This establishes that DeepHarmony can be used with an overlap cohort to reduce inconsistencies in segmentation caused by changes in scanner protocol, allowing for modernization of hardware and protocol design in long-term studies without invalidating previously acquired data.","Deep learning,Contrast harmonization,Magnetic resonance imaging",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"IMAGE,SYNTHESIS,BRAIN,MRI,SUBJECT,RELIABILITY,ATROPHY",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6874910,

In this study, a deep learning framework utilizing Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric features of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and populations. By working with the low-dimensional features, Siamese networks were shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR images, with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time, while preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding the asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods that do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.","Structural magnetic resonance imaging,Alzheimer's Disease,Mild Cognitive Impairment,Machine learning,Deep learning,Siamese networks",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.608,"DIAGNOSTIC,GUIDELINES,NATIONAL,INSTITUTE,MULTIMODAL,CLASSIFICATION,HYPOTHETICAL,MODEL,DEMENTIA,RECOMMENDATIONS,WORKGROUPS,PREDICTION,CONVERSION,BIOMARKERS",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf,

Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic colonization of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and B (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.
Materials and methods: CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/ mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined.
Results: In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%.
Conclusions: Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.

It is suggested to predict the superheat temperature of steel at the CRC by using statistical models considering the specifics of technological process. During the first stage, the model itself has been developed by integrating the following two approaches: a machinelearning algorithm and probabilistic graphical model (PGM and Bayesian networks). The first approach provides the point estimate of the intermediate and final temperatures of the specific melting, while the second approach allows evaluating the probability distribution. The PGM-approach is very promising in the situations involving missing, incorrect, or undefined input data, which are quite common at the metallurgical plants. During the first stage, the achieved level of accuracy of tundish temperature prediction was 6.0 degrees C. During the second stage, the model was integrated into the shop automated process control system, which allowed increasing the prediction accuracy and ensuring a real-time control of the process parameters.

This study aims to develop a social frailty prediction system based on machine learning approaches in order to identify the social frailty status of the elders in order to advance appropriate social services provision.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled and collected information from 595 community-dwelling seniors aged 65+. Fourteen predictors established from questionnaires and electronic medical records were used to predict the social frailty of participants. Bagged classification and regression trees, model average neural network, random forest, C5.0, eXtreme gradient boosting, and stochastic gradient boosting were used to build the predictive model in use. Performance was compared using accuracy, kappa, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. The frailty predictive system was web-based and built upon representational state transfer application program interfaces.
Results: C5.0 achieved the best overall performance than remaining learners, and was adopted as the base learner for the social frailty prediction system. In terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), health literacy (AUC=0.68) was found to be the most important variable for predicting one's social frailty, followed by comorbidity (AUC=0.67), religious participation (AUC=0.67), physical activity (AUC=0.66), and geriatric depression score (AUC=0.62).

These stress ""hot spots"" intuitively represent regions that accumulate higher damage than their surroundings, serving as prime locations for crack nucleation. There are a number of microstructural factors that contribute to whether a given neighborhood is prone to forming a hot spot, including the morphology of local features, their relative crystallographic misorientations and elastic anisotropy, and their preferred orientations with respect to the load state. Given the large number of features that may influence the formation of stress hot spots, it is advantageous to develop techniques that attempt to predict their formation based solely on an image of the underlying microstructure. We describe such a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN is trained by cutting local patches out of a synthetic microstructure, created in DREAM.3D, that had its elastic response modeled using a spectral technique based on fast Fourier transforms. The model microstructure system consists of discrete particles within a continuous matrix. The resulting trained CNN is able to predict which regions of a microstructure are susceptible to forming hot spots, based only on an image description.","Convolutional neural networks,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,4.256,,MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION,,

Real-time feedback of acoustic shadows can guide sonographers to a standardized diagnostic viewing plane with minimal artifacts and can provide additional information for other automatic image analysis algorithms. However, automatically detecting shadow regions using learning-based algorithms is challenging because pixel-wise ground truth annotation of acoustic shadows is subjective and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of acoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused confidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general shadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level annotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations. A transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow segmentation to a reference confidence map. In addition, a confidence estimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and the reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow confidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation metrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation, and so on, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human annotation and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow segmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow confidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view image fusion, and automated biometric measurements.","Ultrasound imaging,deep learning,weakly supervised,shadow detection,confidence estimation",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"ACOUSTIC,SHADOW,3D,ULTRASOUND,SEGMENTATION,SPECKLE,REGISTRATION,IMAGES",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/files/112260875/manuscript_tmi.pdf,
