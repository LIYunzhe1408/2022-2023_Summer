1,A convolutional neural network approach to detect congestive heart failure,55,,,"Porumb Mihaela,Iadanza Ernesto,Massaro Sebastiano,Pecchia Leandro","Porumb M,Iadanza E,Massaro S,Pecchia L",Pecchia L,10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101597,University of Warwick,"Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a severe pathophysiological condition associated with high prevalence, high mortality rates, and sustained healthcare costs, therefore demanding efficient methods for its detection. Despite recent research has provided methods focused on advanced signal processing and machine learning, the potential of applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches to the automatic detection of CHF has been largely overlooked thus far. This study addresses this important gap by presenting a CNN model that accurately identifies CHF on the basis of one raw electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat only, also juxtaposing existing methods typically grounded on Heart Rate Variability. We trained and tested the model on publicly available ECG datasets, comprising a total of 490,505 heartbeats, to achieve 100% CHF detection accuracy. Importantly, the model also identifies those heartbeat sequences and ECG's morphological characteristics which are class-discriminative and thus prominent for CHF detection. Overall, our contribution substantially advances the current methodology for detecting CHF and caters to clinical practitioners' needs by providing an accurate and fully transparent tool to support decisions concerning CHF detection.

However, in order to produce a computationally efficient network, with minimal network architecture, a structural fingerprint whose components are highly correlated to the per atom energy is necessary. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness a structural fingerprint motivated by the highly successful MEAM formalism by creating an artificial neural network containing a single hidden layer of 20 nodes which provides a semi-empirical force field potential for elemental titanium. This potential is suitable for dynamic calculations of alpha-, beta-, and omega-titanium at a variety of temperatures.

The results show that, such combination can achieve high predictive accuracy on the TTT diagrams of stainless steel with a high correlation coefficient value and low root mean squared error value. Comparison among the results of ML and commonly used empirical formulas illustrate the obvious advantage of machine learning approaches.

Computer vision techniques show excellent performance for image texture recognition tasks and have been applied to some material domains. In order to explore more possibilities and widen the applications of computer vision techniques on material domains, as well as reduce the labor and knowledge requirements for FCISs recognition tasks, a state-of-the-art object detector - deeply supervised object detector which can train models from scratch, was introduced. The models trained from limited data show reasonable capacity for recognizing FCISs. Results demonstrate that increasing training dataset size can improve the accuracies of the models, while raising the number of epochs can result in a superior ability to recognize delicate features. Moreover, most of the images that cannot be recognized for FCISs possess common characteristics, such as, poor image quality, unclear features, insufficient training data and etc. Based on the above findings, several proposals are made for the future work to improve the performance of the same or relevant studies, as a reference.","Fatigue crack initiation site,Deeply supervised object detector,DSOD,Machine learning",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,3.222,,COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,,

This manuscript presents an approach, we named QTDU, that combines deep learning models with superpixel-driven segmentation methods for assessing the quality of tissues from dermatological ulcers.
Method: QTDU consists of a three-stage pipeline for the obtaining of ulcer segmentation, tissues' labeling, and wounded area quantification. We set up our approach by using a real and annotated set of dermatological ulcers for training several deep learning models to the identification of ulcered superpixels.
Results: Empirical evaluations on 179,572 superpixels divided into four classes showed QTDU accurately spot wounded tissues (AUC = 0.986, sensitivity = 0.97, and specificity = 0.974) and outperformed machine-learning approaches in up to 8.2% regarding F1-Score through fine-tuning of a ResNet-based model. Last, but not least, experimental evaluations also showed QTDU correctly quantified wounded tissue areas within a 0.089 Mean Absolute Error ratio.
Conclusions: Results indicate QTDU effectiveness for both tissue segmentation and wounded area quantification tasks. When compared to existing machine-learning approaches, the combination of superpixels and deep learning models outperformed the competitors within strong significant levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

8,Improving operation in an industrial MDF flash dryer through physics-based NMPC,94,,,"Santos Pedro,Luis Pitarch Jose,Vicente Alberto,de Prada Cesar,Garcia Angel","Santos P,Pitarch JL,Vicente A,de Prada C,Garcia A",Pitarch JL,10.1016/j.conengprac.2019.104213,Universidad de Valladolid,"Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has increased popularity thanks to the availability of black-box models, systematically obtained from plant data via machine-learning procedures. Although this may be a good approach in the medium term, pure data-driven models quickly become outdated with changes in the process operation, so re-identification (training) routines are periodically required. Moreover, if the NMPC includes any economic objective to drive the process to a more efficient operation, these models often go beyond their validity range, which translates in a degraded control performance (high plant-model mismatch). In this work, the above issues are considered to model the drying section of an industrial medium density fibreboard (MDF) plant. The main contribution of this work is proposing a lumped-parameter grey-box model built upon first principles and completed with experimental equations, obtained from constrained regression with plant data. Upon this model, a moving-horizon estimator (MHE) is designed to estimate unmeasured inputs and states. Then, a mixed economic-tracking NMPC, which explicitly considers actuator-stiction compensation, is proposed to drive the dryer to the humidity setpoint by the most efficient path. Both optimisations are solved within the system sampling interval thanks to an efficient discretisation of the system dynamics by orthogonal collocation, and to the high computational performance achieved by modern software tools for numerical optimal control. The controller was firstly tested in simulation with a rigorous model of a generic MDF dryer, and it is currently implemented in the actual plant achieving significant performance improvements.","Grey-box model,NMPC,Wood industry,MDF dryer,Humidity control,Stiction",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.415,"MODEL-PREDICTIVE,CONTROL,VALVE,STICTION,MPC,SYSTEMS,COMPENSATION,FORMULATION,STABILITY,FRAMEWORK",CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conengprac.2019.104213,

Proximal sensors, such as portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry, may help to overcome these issues since they have been shown to produce accurate predictions of many soil properties. However, such processes need to be further investigated in Brazilian soils. This work aimed to assess the influence of soil management and mineralogy on elemental composition of soils and predict exchangeable Al3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and available K+, and P contents from pXRF data alone and associated with soil texture through machine learning algorithms [stepwise generalized linear models (SGLM), and random forest (RF)] in soils of the Brazilian Coastal Plains (BCP). A total of 285 soil samples were collected from the A (n = 123) and B (n = 162) horizons and subjected to laboratory analyses and pXRF scans. Samples were randomly separated into 70% for modeling and 30% for validation. Soil mineralogy and management mainly influenced Al, and Ca and K total content, respectively. In general, the inclusion of the auxiliary input data of soil texture did not change the predictive power of the models. The best results highlight a considerable promise of pXRF technique for rapidly assessing exchangeable Ca2+ (RMSE = 176.3 mg kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71), Mg2+ (37.7 mg kg(-1) , 0.60), and available K+ (27.46 mg kg(-1), 0.67). The algorithms could not generate reliable models to predict exchangeable Al3+ (30.6 mg kg(-1), 0.47) and available P (19.9 mg kg(-1), 0.14). In sum, pXRF can be used to reasonably predict soil fertility properties in the BCP soils. Further studies may extend predictions to othersoil properties.","Spectroscopy,Kaolinitic soils,Soil texture,Proximal sensors",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,6.183,"PEDOTRANSFER,FUNCTIONS,VARIABLE,IMPORTANCE,REGRESSION,TABLELANDS,MODELS,XRF",GEODERMA,,

Moreover, many unexpected events such as machine breakdowns and material problems may be present to adversely affect the initial job scheduling. This work views JSSP as a sequential decision making problem and proposes to use deep reinforcement learning to cope with this problem. The combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning avoids handcraft features as used in traditional reinforcement learning, and it is expected that the combination will make the whole learning phase more efficient.

Actor network agent learns how to behave in different situations, while critic network helps agent evaluate the value of statement then return to actor network.

The whole network is trained with parallel training on a multi-agent environment and different simple dispatching rules are considered as actions.

Abrasion resistance refers to the ability of rocks to withstand wear. Abrasion resistance is used to determine the resistance of building materials produced for flooring, cladding, and pavements and to demonstrate suitability for higher movement areas. While it is, therefore, very necessary to determine the abrasion rate of building materials prior to construction, it is, however, highly demanding and time consuming to determine abrasion rates. Thus, the aim of this study is to use some rock properties to determine abrasion rates. The study samples, consisting of 32 different types of rocks (sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous) collected from different regions in Turkey, were subjected to some physical and mechanical tests, namely the following: unit volume weight (UVW), apparent porosity (AP), modulus of elasticity (E), uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), tensile strength (TS), Shore hardness (SH), and point load strength (PL) and Bohme abrasion tests. To ascertain the abrasion rate from some physical and mechanical properties of rocks, the results of these tests were analyzed using data mining (DM) techniques. The results showed that there are high correlation coefficients between abrasion rate and the aforementioned rock properties with the support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF) models obtained as R = 0.882 and 0.881, respectively.

Materials and Methods: Fifty-six postoperative high-grade glioma patients with suspicious progression after radiotherapy and chemotherapy from two centers were studied. Pre-and post-contrast T1WI and T2 FLAIR were collected. Each pre-contrast image was voxel-wise subtracted from the co-registered post-contrast image. Dataset was randomly split into training, and testing on a 7:3 ratio, accordingly subjected to a five fold cross validation. Best feature subsets were selected by Pearson con elation coefficient and recursive feature elimination, whereupon a radiomics classifier was built with SVM. The discriminating performance was assessed with the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).
Results: In all, 186 features were extracted on each subtraction map. Top nine T1WI subtraction features, top thirteen T2 FLAIR subtraction features and top thirteen combination features were selected to build optimal SVM classifiers accordingly. The accuracies/AUCs/sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV of SVM based on sole T1WI subtraction were 80.00%/80.00% (CI: 0.5370-1.0000)/100%/70.00%/62.50%/ 100%. Those results of SVM based on sole T2 FLAIR subtraction were 86.67%/84.00% (CI: 0.5962-1.0000)/100%/80%/71.43%/100%. Those results of SVM based on both T1WI subtraction and T2 FLAIR subtraction were 93.33%/94.00% (CI: 0.7778-1.0000)/100%/90%/83.33%/100%, respectively.
Conclusion: Pre-and post-contrast T2 FLAIR subtraction provided added value for diagnosis between recurrence and TRE. SVM based on a combination of T1WI and T2 FLAIR subtraction maps was superior to the sole use of T1WI or T2 FLAIR for differentiating TRE from recurrence. The SVM classifier based on combination of pre-and post-contrast subtraction T2 FLAIR and T1WI imaging allowed for the accurate differential diagnosis of TRE from recurrence, which is of paramount importance for treatment management of postoperative glioma patients after radiation therapy.","glioma recurrence,treatment-related effects,T2 FLAIR enhancement,image subtraction,support vector machines",Article,"DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD, PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",Oncology,,3.947,"HIGH-GRADE,GLIOMAS,RADIATION,NECROSIS,TUMOR,RECURRENCE,PERFUSION,MRI,PSEUDOPROGRESSION,GLIOBLASTOMA,DIFFUSION,PREDICT,ENHANCEMENT,BEVACIZUMAB",CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=57949,

To solve this problem, a method of identifying material of loose particles in the aerobat based on particle impact noise detection (PIND) is proposed. This method firstly uses short-time autocorrelation function to obtain the pulse part of PIND signal, and then extracts various statistic features in time domain and frequency domain, which is combined with Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature, and finally trains support vector machine model for material classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, loose particles' PIND signals with three different types of material are acquired and used for model training and tests. Test results show that the accuracy of identification can reach 98% which is better than related papers' results, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.","loose particle detection; particle impact noise detection (PIND); ,machine learning,; signal recognition; support vector machine",Article,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a weighted deep forest model, which includes a weighted class vector, and a prediction class vector. In our experiment, we extract functional connection (FC) features from fMRI data. Then, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of FC features.

Therefore, accurate PET-CT image registration, which is used for anatomical structure and functional information fusion, is a prerequisite for early stage cancer diagnosis. However, some hypermetabolic anatomical structures, such as brain and bladder, have low registration accuracy. To solve this problem, a 3D unsupervised network based on a metabolic constraint function and a multi-domain similarity measure (3D MC-MDS Net) is proposed for 3D PET-CT image registration. Specifically, a metabolic constraint model is established based on the standard uptake value (SUV) distribution of hypermetabolic regions such as brain, bladder, liver and heart, which reduces the excessive distortion on displacement vector field (DVF) caused by hypermetabolic anatomical structures in PET images. A DVF estimator is built based on 3D unsupervised convolutional neural networks and a spatial transformer is used for warping 3D PET images to 3D CT images. The generated registration results (PET image patches) and the original 3D CT image patches are used for calculating the spatial domain similarity (SD similarity) and frequency domain similarity (FD similarity). Finally, the loss function of the entire registration network is constructed by a weighted sum of SD similarity, FD similarity and a smoothness of DVF. A dataset consisted of 170 whole-body PET-CT images is used for registration accuracy evaluation. The proposed unsupervised registration network, 3D MC-MDS Net, can accurately learn the 3D registration model by using the training dataset with the metabolic constraint model, which significantly improves the registration accuracy.","PET,CT images,3D image registration,unsupervised registration,metabolic constraint,convolutional neural network",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"MAXIMIZATION,PERFORMANCE",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09052732.pdf,

Variations in sensory-motor behavior can be caused by several factors, including changes in cognitive status and intrinsic neural variations in the brain. The correct identification of neural sources of behavioral variations is important for understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of sensory-motor behavior and for practical applications (e.g., the development of a precise brain-computer interface). However, studies on humans that investigate the neural sources of the trial-by-trial variation of the sensory-motor behavior are scarce. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of behavioral variations in smooth pursuit eye movements. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) activity from 15 participants while they performed a smooth pursuit eye movement task, wherein they tracked randomly selected visual motion targets that moved radially from the center of the screen. We isolated neural components that are specific to the trial-by-trial variation of smooth pursuit latency, speed, and direction using a novel multivariate pattern-analysis technique. We found that the phase of the spatially distributed multivariate theta oscillation was correlated with the trial-by-trial variation of pursuit latency and direction.

The AX parameter is a new one compared to the other studies reported in the literature. The regression coefficient (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are used to determine the accuracies between the use of a four-parameter (BU, CT, IE, AX) and a three-parameter (BU, CT, IE) SVR model in the predicting the local Pu amount in the spent nuclear fuel. The R-2 value for the four-parameter case (0.9996) is closer to unity (best case) than that for the three-parameter case (0.9776). The RMSE for the four-parameter case (0.0034) is less than of the three-parameter case (0.0243). The results of the SVR based machine learning analyses to predict the axial variation of Pu mass density in nuclear fuel show that accurate results are obtained from using the four-parameter case when compared to the original predictions using the SERPENT code. The correlation coefficients for BU, CT, IE, and AX for the Pu mass density variation are also evaluated. From the correlation analysis, it is observed that the most strongly correlated parameter with the Pu mass density is BU. The observations from this study show that the errors in Pu mass density axial variation predictions can be mitigated by considering the AX parameter along with the BU, CT and IE parameters.

Specifically, it learns hierarchal features from unlabeled image patches by minimizing the distance between its input and output, and simultaneously preserving the geometric structure of the whole input data set.

Noting that a brain network captures the individual signature of a particular subject, it remains a formidable challenge to extract a shared and representative brain signature across a population of brain networks, let alone multi-view brain networks. In this paper, we propose netNorm, a method that can meet this challenge by normalizing a population of multi-view brain networks, where each brain network represents a particular view of the brain, acquired using a neuroimaging technique. While conventional methods integrate the network views equally at a global scale, we propose a selective technique which unfolds the fusion process at a local scale by first selecting for each local pairwise connectivity between two anatomical regions of interest the most representative cross-view feature vector in the population. By combining the selected cross-view feature vectors, we then estimate a population representative tensor. Such multi-view representation captures the most shared traits across all subjects and thereby occupies a centered location compared to all views. In the final step, netNorm non-linearly fuses the frontal views of the estimated representative population tensor into a single network depicting the final brain connectional template. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method on four connectomic datasets and we show that netNorm (i) produces the most centered and representative connectional brain template (CBT) that consistently captures the unique and distinctive traits of a population of multi-view brain networks, and (ii) identifies disordered brain connections by comparing templates estimated using disordered and healthy brains, respectively, demonstrating the discriminative power of the estimated CBTs. This allows to rapidly and efficiently spot atypical deviations from the normal brain connectome for comparative studies, circumventing the need to use machine learning techniques for discriminative feature identification.

Although experiments to fine-tune the target designs are the focus of the national ICF program, insightful analysis of the existing data is a pressing need. In highly integrated ignition experiments, it is impossible to vary only one design parameter without perturbing all the other implosion variables.

Its neurobiological diagnosis (or classification) is meaningful for clinicians to give proper treatment for ADHD patients. The existing ADHD classification methods suffer from two problems, i.e., insufficient data and noise disturbance. In this paper, a high-accuracy classification method is proposed by using brain Functional Connectivity (FC) as ADHD features, where an l(2,1)-norm Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model and a binary hypothesis testing framework are effectively employed. In detail, we introduce a binary hypothesis testing framework to cope with insufficient data of ADHD database. The FCs of test data (without seeing its label) are used for training and thus affect the subspace learning of training data under binary hypotheses. On other hand, the l(2,1)-norm LDA model generates a subspace to represent ADHD features, aiming to overcome noise disturbance. By robustly learning ADHD features, the subspace energy difference between binary hypotheses becomes more discriminative. Thereby, the true hypothesis can be rightly estimated with its larger subspace energy, which provides reliable evidence to predict the label of test data. By the test on ADHD-200 database, it shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with the significant average accuracy of 97.6%.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no currently work that attempts to colorize the medical image by using deep neural network. Specifically, we propose Y-loss which is defined as nonlinear combination of l(1) and l(2) norm to preserve content invariance between target and colorized medical image.

Clinically, sleep staging is performed by domain experts through visual inspection of polysomnography (PSG) recordings, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and often subjective in nature. Therefore, this study develops an automatic sleep staging system, which uses single channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, for convenience of wearing and less interference in the sleep, to do automatic identification of various sleep stages. To achieve the automatic sleep staging system, this study proposes a two-layer stacked ensemble model, which combines the advantages of random forest (RF) and LightGBM (LGB), where RF focuses on reducing the variance of the proposed model while LGB focuses on reducing the bias of the proposed model. Particularly, the proposed model introduces a class balance strategy to improve the N1 stage recognition rate. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, experiments are performed on two datasets, including Sleep-EDF database (SEDFDB) and Sleep-EDF Expanded database (SEDFEDB). In the SEDFDB, the overall accuracy (ACC), weight F1-score (WF1), Cohen & x2019;s Kappa coefficient (Kappa), sensitivity of N1 (SEN-N1) obtained by proposed model are 91.2 & x0025;, 0.916, 0.864 and 72.52 & x0025; respectively using subject-non-independent test (SNT).

In this paper, we propose to combine the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with fully convolutional layers for feature extraction with gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) for superconductors critical temperature (Tc) prediction. Our prediction model only uses the elemental property statistics of the materials as original input and learns a hierarchical representation of superconductors using convolutional layers. Computational experiments showed that our convolutional gradient boosting decision tree (ConvGBDT) model achieved the state-of-the-art results on three superconductor data sets: DataS, DataH, and DataK. By visually comparing the raw elemental feature distribution and the learned feature distribution, it is found that the convolutional layers of our ConvGBDT can learn features that can more effectively distinguish cuprate and iron-based superconductors.

However, diagnosing LPRD is difficult because of the lack of specific symptoms or clinical gold standard. An objective and reliable test, which does not rely on a perfect clinical gold standard, is required in clinical practice. Methods: 60 normal volunteers and 74 confirmed Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) patients were labelled based on the combined consideration of the reflux symptom index, reflux finding score, 24h oropharyngeal pH monitoring and results of anti-reflux treatment. 72 candidate features were extracted from pH recordings and the most efficient feature combination was detected using a stepwise wrapper method. The labelled data were combined with 1552 unlabelled data for feature selection and model training using semi-supervised learning. A latent class model method was used to assess the proposed model based on 64 additional validation data and an imperfect clinical reference test. Results: A new score (named W score), which significantly improved the sensitivity of the LPRD test (82.67 & x0025; vs. 24.09 & x0025;) and has a relatively high specificity (80.19 & x0025;), was proposed.

In our method, noise distributed in the input low-dose CT image is learned by the generator network and then subtracted from the input to generate the final denoised version. The denoised CT images are penalized by the least squares loss function, and they are pulled toward boundary of the decision even though they are classified as normal-dose CT. Least squares stabilize the training process without regularization. Structural similarity and L1 losses are utilized to keep textural details and sharpness of the denoised CT images respectively.

TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method which enables a robot to learn both motion skills and stiffness profiles from humans through kinesthetic human-robot cooperation.
Design Methodology Approach
Admittance control is applied to allow robot-compliant behaviors when following the reference trajectories. By extending the dynamical movement primitives (DMP) model, a new concept of DMP and stiffness primitives is introduced to encode a kinesthetic demonstration as a combination of trajectories and stiffness profiles, which are subsequently transferred to the robot. Electromyographic signals are extracted from a human's upper limbs to obtain target stiffness profiles. By monitoring vibrations of the end-effector velocities, a stability observer is developed. The virtual damping coefficient of admittance controller is adjusted accordingly to eliminate the vibrations.
Findings
The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated experimentally. The result shows that the robot can perform tasks in a variable stiffness mode as like the human dose in the teaching phase.
Originality Value
DMP has been widely used as a teaching by demonstration method to represent movements of humans and robots. The proposed method extends the DMP framework to allow a robot to learn not only motion skills but also stiffness profiles. Additionally, the authors proposed a stability observer to eliminate vibrations when the robot is disturbed by environment.","Robotics,Path planning,Man machine interface (MMI),Cooperative robots",Article,"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD, HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,1.667,,ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION,,

Machine learning models were developed to predict product yields and characteristics from HIT of various feedstocks. The model results were then integrated into a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to compute two metrics: energy return on investment (EROI) and net global warming potential (GWP). Results showed random forest models had better prediction accuracy than regression tree and multiple linear regression to model HTT of feedstocks (e.g., microalgae, crops/forest residues, energy crops, and biodegradable organic wastes) and predicted the mass yields of multiple products (biocrude, hydrochar, gas, and aqueous co product) as well as the energy and carbon contents of biocrude and hydrochar. LCA results revealed that the proposed HTT-CCS system constituted a net-energy producing NET for some combinations of feedstock characteristics and reaction conditions. Best overall energy and GWP performance was achieved for HTT-CCS of lignocellulosic biomass at low temperature.

The aim of this work was to compare different pectin extraction methods: power ultrasound (US), enzymes, combination of US and enzymes (US + E), and acids (nitric and sodium citrate). After 6 h, pectin yield was higher when US was applied in combination with Celluclast (R) 1.5 L (up to 13.9%). Structural characterisation showed that US-extracted pectins had lower weight-average molecular weight (M-w) values (146-155 kDa) than pectin extracted with US + E (160-267 kDa) and acid-extracted pectin (329-352 kDa). Monomeric composition reflected that pectin extracted with acids had the highest galacturonic acid (GalA) contents (82.2-90.2%) and the lowest degree of branching [Rha/GalA] (0.026-0.031). Structural characteristics of the different pectins were modelled using two artificial neural networks (ANN) considering composition parameters (Model I) and pectin FT-IR spectra (Model II). In addition, a third ANN was built to determine differences and similarities in the GC-MS spectra of monomeric composition (identified and unidentified monosaccharides) (Model III) showing characteristic patterns with high accuracy rates (above 95% on the test set).

At present, the construction of tunnels in China is mainly depend on labor or mobile concrete sprayer, which has lots problems like time-consuming, low precision, and labor intensive. An intelligent detection method for tunnel shotcrete spraying is proposed in this article. There are two main issues need to be solved, one is the modeling of tunnel in real-time to monitor the thickness of shotcrete and other is the detection of spraying area in the tunnel. The LiDAR can obtain a 3D model of tunnel after performing necessary preprocess on it in real-time. On the other hand, the spraying areas are usually divided by arches in the tunnel, so we can detect the position of arches to determine the spraying areas. Inspired by the YOLO algorithm, we proposed a novel neural network structure to detect the approximate bounding boxes of the arches and a line-detection algorithm is used to determine the final positions of the spraying area in the image. The size of the weight file of our neural network is only 2.57 MB after the use of some deep compression tricks, which means our model is device friendly. After that, the object detection results in the image will be projected to the point cloud data.

The major challenge arises from the complication of robust image characterization in computer-aided WE pictorial diagnostics. The purpose of the research is to provide a biased definition of WE images and to enable medical professionals to automatically identify polyp images. In this paper, the learning feature approach called Deep Stacked Auto Encoder with Constraint Image (DSAECI) for recognizing polyps in WE images has been proposed. This DSAECI differs from the Traditional Method of Auto Encoder (TMAE) due to the introduction of constraint image, created by the nearest neighbor's image and describing inherent object structures. The multiple limitations of images force users to keep images in the same category far away, which share similar learned characteristics and images in various categories and utilized the Flexible medical sensor platform for data analysis. The learned characteristics thus retain large inter-variances and small intra-images. The average total accuracy (OA) of our WE images method is 98.00%.

To produce high-quality steel plates, it is important to precisely detect and sense values of manufacturing factors including plate thickness and roll force in each rolling pass. For example, the estimation or prediction of the in-process thickness is utilized to select the control values (e.g., roll gap) in the next pass of rolling. However, adverse manufacturing conditions can interfere with accurate detection for such manufacturing factors. Although the state-of-the-art gamma-ray camera can be used for measuring the thickness, the outputs from it are influenced by adverse manufacturing conditions such as the high temperature of plates, followed by the evaporation of lubricant water. Thus, it is inevitable that there is noise in the thickness estimation. Furthermore, installing such thickness measurements for each passing step is costly. The precision of the thickness estimation, therefore, significantly affects the cost and quality of the final product. In this paper, we present machine learning (ML) technologies and models that can be used to predict the in-process thickness in the SPM operation, so that the measurement cost for the in-process thickness can be significantly reduced and high-quality steel plate production can be possible. To do so, we investigate most-known technologies in this application. In particular, Data Clustering based Machine Learning (DC-ML), combining clustering algorithms and supervised learning algorithms, is introduced. To evaluate DC-ML, two experiments are conducted and show that DC-ML is well suited to the prediction problems in the SPM operation.

DBS is an accepted treatment for individuals living with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This surgery involves implantation of a permanent electrode inside the STN to deliver electrical current. Since the STN is a very small region inside the brain, accurate placement of an electrode is a challenging task for the surgical team. Prior to placement of the permanent electrode, microelectrode recordings of brain activity are used intraoperatively to localize the STN. The placement of the electrode and the success of the therapy depend on this location. In this paper, an objective approach is implemented to help the surgical team in localizing the STN. This is achieved by processing the MER signals and extracting features during the surgery to be used in a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for defining the neurophysiological borders of the STN. For this purpose, a new classification approach is proposed with the goal of detecting both the dorsal and the ventral borders of the STN during the surgical procedure. Results collected from 100 PD patients in this study, show that by calculating and extracting wavelet transformation features from MER signals and using a data-driven computational deep neural network model, it is possible to detect the borders of the STN with an accuracy of 92%. The proposed method can be implemented in real-time during the surgery to model the neurophysiological nonlinearity along the path of the electrode trajectory during insertion.","Deep brain stimulation,deep neural network,intraoperative localization of STN,Parkinson's disease",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,3.192,"DEEP,BRAIN-STIMULATION,SUBTHALAMIC,NUCLEUS",IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147929,

The presented research demonstrates a novel algorithm, Predict-Evaluate-Correct K-fold (PECK), that trains ensembles to learn well from limited data. The PECK algorithm is used to train a deep ensemble on 153 non-dermoscopic lesion images, significantly outperforming prior publications and state-of-the-art methods trained and evaluated on the same dataset. The PECK algorithm merges deep convolutional neural networks with support vector machine and random forest classifiers to achieve an introspective learning method. Where the ensemble is organized hierarchically, deeper layers are provided not only more training folds, but also the predictions of previous layers. Subsequent classifiers then learn and correct the previous layer errors by training on the original data with injected predictions for new data folds. In addition to the PECK algorithm, a novel segmentation algorithm, Synthesis and Convergence of Intermediate Decaying Omnigradients (SCIDOG), is developed to accurately detect lesion contours in non-dermoscopic images, even in the presence of significant noise, hair, and fuzzy lesion boundaries. As SCIDOG is a non-learning algorithm, it is unhindered by data quantity limitations. The automatic and precise segmentations that SCIDOG produces allows for the extraction of 1,812 lesion features that quantify shape, color and texture. These morphological features are used in conjunction with convolutional neural network predictions for training the PECK ensemble. The combination of SCIDOG and PECK algorithms are used to diagnose melanomas and benign nevi through automatic digital image analysis on the MED-NODE dataset. Evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed methods achieve significantly increased diagnostic capability over the best prior methods.","Convolutional neural network,feature extraction,medical diagnostic imaging,random forest,support vector machine",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"CANCER,CLASSIFICATION,BORDER,DETECTION,SKIN-LESIONS,DERMOSCOPY,IMAGES,SYSTEM",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/08993822.pdf,

Given that most of this raw data is unlabeled, great effort is required to adapt it for behavioral phenotyping or signal extraction, for behavioral and neurophysiological data, respectively. Traditional methods for labeling datasets rely on human annotators which is a resource and time intensive process, which often produce data that that is prone to reproducibility errors. Here, we propose a deep learning-based image segmentation framework to automatically extract and label limb movements from movies capturing frontal and lateral views of head-fixed mice. The method decomposes the image into elemental regions (superpixels) with similar appearance and concordant dynamics and stacks them following their partial temporal trajectory. These 3D descriptors (referred as motion cues) are used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the features extracted at the last fully connected layer of the network for training a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that introduces spatio-temporal coherence to the limb segmentation. We tested the pipeline in two video acquisition settings. In the first, the camera is installed on the right side of the mouse (lateral setting). In the second, the camera is installed facing the mouse directly (frontal setting).

To alleviate this problem, we propose a multi-scale context-guided network named as MSCGnet to segment the skin lesions accurately. In MSCGnet, the context information is utilized to guide the feature encoding procedure. Moreover, because of the information loss in spatial down-sampling, a context-based attention structure (CAs) is designed to select effective context features in the decoding path. Furthermore, we boost the performance of MSCGnet with iterations and term this upgraded version as iterative MSCGnet, denoted as iMSCGnet. To supervise the training of iMSCGnet in an end-to-end fashion, a novel objective function of deep supervision, which consists of the terms of each encoding layers and the terms from each MSCGnet output of iMSCGnet, is employed.

In this paper, a competent optimization model is exploited to overcome the weakness of deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA). The model consists of principal component analysis (PCA) on the multi-modality linear features learning and multi-layer belief networks on multi-modality nonlinear features learning. In order to complete a better result of correlation analysis and classification, the output nodes of multi-layer belief network are used for back propagation (BP) network training. Previous works on solving canonical correlation analysis (CCA) had proposed several models based on deep neural network or regularization, typically involving either some form of norm or auto-encoders with a reconstruction objective.

The classic ML learns from expert features, and the DL learns from a spectro-temporal representation of the signal. The method was evaluated on recordings from 947 subjects from six publicly available datasets and one CHF dataset that was collected for this study.

The method's aggregated accuracy is 92.9% (error of 7.1%); while the experimental results are not directly comparable, this error rate is relatively close to the percentage of recordings labeled as ""unknown"" by experts (9.7%). Finally, we identified 15 expert features that are useful for building ML models to differentiate between CHF phases (i.e., in the decompensated phase during hospitalization and in the recompensated phase) with an accuracy of 93.2%. The proposed method shows promising results both for the distinction of recordings between healthy subjects and patients and for the detection of different CHF phases.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis can provide thoroughly assessment for different CVDs efficiently. We propose a multi-task group bidirectional long short-term memory (MTGBi-LSTM) framework to intelligent recognize multiple CVDs based on multi-lead ECG signals. Methods: This model employs a Group Bi-LSTM (GBi-LSTM) and Residual Group Convolutional Neural Network (Res-GCNN) to learn the dual feature representation of ECG space and time series. GBi-LSTM is divided into Global Bi-LSTM and Intra-Group Bi-LSTM, which can learn the features of each ECG lead and the relationship between leads. Then, through attention mechanism, the different lead information of ECG is integrated to make the model to possess the powerful feature discriminability. Through multi-task learning, the model can fully mine the association information between diseases and obtain more accurate diagnostic results. In addition, we propose a dynamic weighted loss function to better quantify the loss to overcome the imbalance between classes. Results: Based on more than 170,000 clinical 12-lead ECG analysis, the MTGBi-LSTM method achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 of 88.86;, 90.67;, 94.19; and 92.39;, respectively.

While several biometric approaches have been studied for user recognition, there are demands for more convenient techniques suitable for the IoT devices. Recently, electrical frequency responses of the human body have been unveiled as one of promising biometric signals, but the pilot studies are inconclusive about the characteristics of human body as a transmission medium for electric signals. This paper provides a multi-domain analysis of human body impulse responses (HBIR) measured at the receiver when customized impulse signals are passed through the human body. We analyzed the impulse responses in the time, frequency, and wavelet domains and extracted representative feature vectors using a proposed accumulated difference metric in each domain. The classification performance was tested using the-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm on 10-day data acquired from five subjects. The average classification accuracies of the simple classifier KNN for the time, frequency, and wavelet features reached 92.99;, 77.01;, and 94.55;, respectively. In addition, the kernel-based SVM slightly improved the accuracies of three features by 0.58;, 2.34;, and 0.42;, respectively.

Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation.

The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block.

Recent popularity of IoT and machine learning techniques could provide enabling technologies for collecting real-time big data and analyzing them for more accurate prediction of allergic disease risks for evidence-based intervention, but the effort is still in its infancy. This pilot study explored and evaluated the feasibility of a deep learning algorithm for predicting asthma risk. It is based on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) of 14 pediatric asthma patients visiting the Korea University Medical Center and indoor particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 concentration data collected at their residence every 10 minutes using a PM monitoring device with a low-cost sensor between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. We interpolated the PEFR results collected twice a day for each patient throughout the day so that it can be matched to the PM and other weather data. The PEFR results were classified into three categories such as 'Green' (normal), 'Yellow' (mild to moderate exacerbation) and 'Red' (severe exacerbation) with reference to their best peak flow value. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained using the first 10 months of the linked data and predicted asthma risk categories for the next 2 months during the study period. LSTM model is found to predict the asthma risk categories better than multinomial logistic (MNL) regression as it incorporates the cumulative effects of PM concentrations over time.

While single disease classification schemes are greatly dealt by the researchers in the past, developing a unified scheme which is capable of detecting multiple gastrointestinal (GI) diseases is very challenging due to the highly irregular behavior of diseased images in terms of color patterns. Method: In this paper, a computer-aided method is developed to detect multiple GI diseases from WCE videos utilizing linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based region of interest (ROI) separation scheme followed by a probabilistic model fitting approach. Commonly in training phase, as pixel-labeled images are available in small number, only the image-level annotations are used for detecting diseases in WCE images, whereas pixel-level knowledge, although a major source for learning the disease characteristics, is left unused. In view of learning the characteristic disease patterns from pixel-labeled images, a set of LDA models are trained which are later used to extract the salient ROI from WCE images both in training and testing stages. The intensity patterns of ROI are then modeled by a suitable probability distribution and the fitted parameters of the distribution are utilized as features in a supervised cascaded classification scheme. Results: For the purpose of validation of the proposed multi-disease detection scheme, a set of pixel-labeled images of bleeding, ulcer and tumor are used to extract the LDA models and then, a large WCE dataset is used for training and testing. A high level of accuracy is achieved even with a small number of pixel-labeled images. Conclusion: Therefore, the proposed scheme is expected to help physicians in reviewing a large number of WCE images to diagnose different GI diseases.","Capsule endoscopy,linear discriminant analysis,gastrointestinal disease detection,probability density function model,support vector machine",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,3.192,"BLEEDING,DETECTION",IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6221039/8943243/08962125.pdf,

Distinguishing melanoma lesions from non-melanoma lesions has however been a challenging task. Many Computer Aided Diagnosis and Detection Systems have been developed in the past for this task.

The system employs multi-stage and multi-scale approach and utilizes softmax classifier for pixel-wise classification of melanoma lesions.

Wireless connected biomedical sensors (Medical Things) rely on coding and modulating of the sensor data onto wireless (radio) bursts which comply with specific physical layer standards like 802.11, 802.15.1 or 802.15.4.

During the initial stage of PD, vocal impairments become more common among the affected individuals. Advanced studies on vocal disorders give more assistance for precise PD detection. In this paper, the vocal features of PD affected individuals are analyzed with sophisticated computational models. Initially, the samples are pre-processed, as it contains more missing values. Then the predictor candidate subset is identified from the processed vocal features using the Adaptive Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm, a meta-heuristic global search optimization technique. Furthermore, the latent representation of the candidate features is extracted through sparse autoencoders for effective discrimination between the PD affected and control cases.

However, most of these studies focus on the properties of single channel EEG data while neglecting the association between signals from diverse channels. To bridge this gap, we propose an EEG instance matching-based epilepsy classification approach by introducing one convolutional neural network (CNN). First of all, each pair of EEG signals are exploited to form one 2 dimensional matrix, which could be used to reveal the interaction between them. Secondly, the generated matrices are fed into the proposed CNN that would discriminate the input representations. To evaluate the performance of the presented approach, the comparison experiments between the state-of-the-art techniques and our work are conducted on publicly available epilepsy EEG benchmark database. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm could yield the performance with an average accuracy of 99.3 & x0025;, average sensitivity of 99.5 & x0025;, and average specificity 99.6 & x0025;.","Electroencephalography,Convolution,Feature extraction,Epilepsy,Convolutional neural networks,Machine learning,Pipelines,Convolution,machine learning,classification algorithms",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"FEATURE-EXTRACTION,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,SEIZURE,DETECTION,CROWD,EVACUATION,CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEMS,SELECTION,FEATURES,MODEL,VIDEO",IEEE ACCESS,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2976751,

To guarantee a satisfactory lifetime, electrical machines are designed to operate winding temperatures well below their thermal class, which results in an oversized design. Standard methods for thermal lifetime evaluation of electrical machines are based on accelerated aging tests that require several months of testing. This paper proposes an alternative approach relying on a supervised neural network that significantly shortens the time demanded by accelerated aging tests for thermal lifetime evaluation of electrical machines. The supervised neural network is based on a feedforward neural network trained with Bayesian Regularisation Backpropagation (BRP) algorithm. The network predicts the wire insulation resistance with respect to its aging time at aging temperatures of 250 & x00B0;C, 270 & x00B0;C and 290 & x00B0;C, which reveals a good match of prediction outcomes against the experimental findings. The mean time-to-failure at each aging temperature is extracted using the Weibull probability plot in order to compare the Arrhenius curves for both conventional and proposed method and a relative error of 0.125 & x0025; is achieved in terms of their temperature indexes. In addition, the analysis shows a time saving of 1680 hours (57 & x0025; time saved of experimental test procedure) when the thermal life of the insulating material is predicted using BRP neural network.","Insulation,Neural networks,Aging,Training,Thermal stresses,Stress,Windings,Neural network,aging time,thermal life of insulation,accelerated lifetime test",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,"INSULATION,SYSTEMS,VOLTAGE",IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09007468.pdf,

Tongue image segmentation lays a solid foundation for quantitative tongue analysis and diagnosis. However, the segmentation of tongue body is challenging due to the factors such as large personal variation of tongue body on color, texture and shape, as well as weak edges caused by similar color between tongue body and neighboring tissues, especially the lip. Existing segmentation methods usually use only single color component and simple prior knowledge, thus leading to inaccuracy and instability. To alleviate these issues, a patch-driven segmentation method with sparse representation is proposed in this paper. Specifically, each patch in the testing image is sparsely represented by patches in the spatially varying dictionary, which is constructed by the local patches of training images. The derived sparse coefficients are then employed to estimate the tongue probability. Finally, the hard segmentation is obtained by applying the maximum a posteriori (MAP) rule on the tongue probability map and further polished with morphological operations. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a tongue image dataset including 290 subjects using 10-fold cross-validation, as well as additional 10 unseen testing subjects. The proposed method has achieved more accurate segmentation results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","Tongue,Image segmentation,Image edge detection,Training,Testing,Image color analysis,Dictionaries,Chinese medicine,image segmentation,medical image processing,sparse representation,tongue diagnosis",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,SELECTION,IEEE ACCESS,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.2976826,

However, most conventional approaches either perform face frontalization on a non-frontal facial image or learn separate classifier for each pose. Different from existing methods, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning model that allows to simultaneous facial image synthesis and pose-invariant facial expression recognition by exploiting shape geometry of the face image. The proposed model is based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and enjoys several merits. First, given an input face and a target pose and expression designated by a set of facial landmarks, an identity-preserving face can be generated through guiding by the target pose and expression. Second, the identity representation is explicitly disentangled from both expression and pose variations through the shape geometry delivered by facial landmarks. Third, our model can automatically generate face images with different expressions and poses in a continuous way to enlarge and enrich the training set for the FER task. Our approach is demonstrated to perform well when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmark datasets including Multi-PIE, BU-3DFE, and SFEW.

The model cascade (MC) strategy, a popular scheme, significantly alleviates the class imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation among the models. To handle these flaws in the MC approach, we propose in this paper a light-weight deep model, i.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better than MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation for brain tumor segmentation. First, OM-Net integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists of shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific parameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively optimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between tasks, which enables us to design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module. By following the guidance of the prediction results provided by the previous task, CGA can adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the category-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing method is introduced to refine the segmentation results of the proposed attention network. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing set and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we also won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating teams.

However, existing methods rely on highly-curated training sets with full supervision, often using heuristics for model fitting or ignore the variances of the data within principal subspaces. In contrast, we propose novel methods that can work with imperfectly curated datasets using robust statistical learning, by extending the multivariate generalized-Gaussian distribution to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and employing it within a mixture model. We propose a novel semi-supervised extension of our learning scheme, showing that a small amount of expert feedback through high-quality labeled data of the outlier class can boost performance. We propose expectation maximization for our semi-supervised robust mixture-model learning in RKHS, using solely the Gram matrix and without the explicit lifting map. Our methods incorporate optimal component means, principal directions, and variances for abnormality detection. Results on four large public datasets on retinopathy and cancer, compared against a variety of contemporary methods, show that our method gives benefits over the state of the art in one-class classification for abnormality detection.","Robustness,Training,Semisupervised learning,Kernel,Data models,Image segmentation,Biomedical imaging,Abnormality detection,one-class classification,reproducing kernel Hilbert space,robust model,generalized multivariate Gaussian,mixture model,expectation maximization,semi-supervised learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,11.491,"UNSUPERVISED,TEXTURE,SEGMENTATION,PRINCIPAL,COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINES,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING,,
