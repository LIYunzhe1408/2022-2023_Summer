1,Best (and Worst) Practices for Organizing a Challenge on Cardiac Biophysical Models During AI Summer: The CRT-EPiggy19 Challenge,12009,,329-341,Camara Oscar,Camara O,Camara O,10.1007/978-3-030-39074-7_35,Pompeu Fabra University,"During the last years tens of challenges have been organized to benchmark computational techniques with shared data. Historically, most challenges in conferences such as MICCAI have been devoted to medical image processing, especially on object recognition or segmentation tasks. Due to the increasing popularity and easy access to machine (deep) learning methods, as part of our current Artificial Intellingence (AI) summer, the number of AI-related challenges has exploded. In parallel, the community of biophysical models also has a valuable history of organizing challenges, including synthetic and experimental data, to assess the accuracy of the resulting simulations. In this paper, the similarities and differences in computational challenges organized by these communities are reviewed, suggesting best practices and what to avoid when organizing a challenge on biophysical models. Specifically, details will be given about the preparation of the CRT-EPiggy19 challenge.","Reproducible research,Computational challenge,Electrophysiological modelling,Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy,Animal data",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,,,

Automatic calculation of all relevant LV indices from cardiac MR images is an intricate task due to large variations among patients and deformation during the cardiac cycle. Typical methods are based on segmentation of the myocardium or direct regression from MR images. To consider cardiac motion and deformation, recurrent neural networks and spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed. We study an approach combining state-of-the-art models and emphasizing transfer learning to account for the small dataset provided for the LVQuan19 challenge. We compare 2D spatial and 3D spatio-temporal CNNs for LV indices regression and cardiac phase classification. To incorporate segmentation information, we propose an architecture-independent segmentation-based regularization. To improve the robustness further, we employ a search scheme that identifies the optimal ensemble from a set of architecture variants. Evaluating on the LVQuan19 Challenge training dataset with 5-fold cross-validation, we achieve mean absolute errors of 111 +/- 76mm(2), 1.84 +/- 0.90mm and 1.22 +/- 0.60mm for area, dimension and regional wall thickness regression, respectively.

The most popular ECG data and the robust deep learning algorithm made it possible to enhance the precision and scalability of electronic ECG interpretation. Still, there is no thorough evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning method used in ECG analysis. In this work, we extend a deep neural network (DNN) to classify rhythm classes using 91,232 single lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. We classify eight rhythm classes using single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device.
When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the potential of applying Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches to the automatic prediction of arrhythmia has been largely overlooked thus far. This study addresses this important gap by presenting a DNN model that accurately identifies arrhythmia depending on one raw electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat only, also collate prevailing algorithms based on Heart Rate divergence. We trained and tested the model using ECG datasets, comprising 380000 heartbeats, to achieve 100% arrhythmia prediction accuracy. Notably, the model also identifies those heartbeat sequences and ECG's morphological characteristics, which are classdiscriminative and thus prominent for arrhythmia prediction. Overall, our contribution substantially advances the current methodology for predicting arrhythmia and caters to clinical practitioners' needs by providing an accurate and fully transparent tool to support arrhythmia prediction decisions.","deep learning,classification,arrhythmia",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"FAILURE,DISEASE,BURDEN",2020 SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRENDS (ITT 2020),,

The ""gold standard"" for chronic pain assessment remains self report and clinical assessment via a biopsychosocial interview, since there has been no device that can measure it. A device to measure pain would be useful not only for clinical assessment, but potentially also as a biofeedback device leading to pain reduction. In this paper we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for chronic pain score assessment. Our deep learning framework splits the long time-course data samples into shorter sequences, and uses Consensus Prediction to classify the results. We evaluate the performance of our framework on two chronic pain score datasets collected from two iterations of prototype Pain Meters that we have developed to help chronic pain subjects better understand their health condition.","deep learning,chronic pain",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Computer Science,,,"CARE,RISK",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12202,

These multiple factors include the excitation energy, temperature, flow velocity, and glucose concentration. To achieve the aim, a set of photoacoustic detection system of glucose solutions was established by using the OPO pulsed laser, ultrasonic transducer, the solution cycling sub-system, signal pre-processing circuit, data acquisition and controlling system. The peak-to-peak values of glucose solutions with different concentrations, temperatures, flow velocities under different energies of pulsed laser were all obtained by the orthogonal experiments. To get the relationship between the peak-to-peak values of glucose and the multiple factors, as well as between the glucose concentration prediction and the multiple factors, four different artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms, i.e., forward propagation (FP), radial basis function (RBF), back propagation (BP), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were used. The root-mean-square error(RMSE) values of different ANN algorithms for the peak- to-peak values prediction and the glucose concentrations prediction were all obtained and compared. Results show that the concentration prediction effect of RBF-ANN is better than that of RNN, BP-ANN, and FP-ANN. Then, to further verify the concentration prediction performance of RBF-ANN, the RMSE values for RBF-ANN algorithm under different parameters of spread were adjusted and compared. Results show that when spread value is 0.7, the RMSE values of photoacoustic peak-to-peak value and the glucose concentration are lest. When the neurons is 108, spread parameter is 0.7, the RMSE of glucose concentration is about 0.45mg/dl.","photoacoustic detection,glucose concentration,combined effect,ANN,RMSE",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"BLOOD,SPECTROSCOPY,MODEL",,,

The seventh report of the National Joint Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension in the United States (JNC7) classified BP levels into normotension (NT), prehypertension (PHT) and hypertension (HT). In this paper, we adopted a deep learning model (ResNet18) based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the Hilbert Transform (HT) to predict the risk level of BP only using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We collected 582 data records from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care database (MIMIC), and each file contained arterial BP signals as the labels for inputs and the corresponding PPG signals as the inputs.

One of the main applications of such systems is the early detection of lung cancerous nodules using Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. Here, we have used a new method for automated detection of lung cancerous/non-cancerous nodules. It is a modularity maximization based graph clustering method. The clustering is done based on the different region's grayscale values of the CT scan images. The clustering algorithm is capable of detecting nodules of size as small as 4 pixels in two dimension (2D) or 9 voxels in three dimensional (3D) data. The advantage of nodule detection is that it can be used as an extra feature for many supervised learning algorithms especially for those Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based architectures where pixel-wise segmentation of data might be required.","Machine learning,Lung cancer,Graph clustering,Modularity,CNN,Segmentation,CT scan",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

In this paper, three DTW methods are compared using supervised classification through the k-nearest neighbor technique to determine the in-control set in a milk chocolate conching process. Four variables were monitored over time and a set of 62 batches with durations between 495 and 1170 min was considered; 53% of the batches were known to be conforming based on lab test results and experts' evaluations.

However, because of insufficient quality of raw data and missing labels, neural networks alone cannot be applied successfully to target the given problem. Thus, we propose an approach combining conventional computer vision techniques and deep learning to automatically detect fibril crossovers in two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy image data and apply it to murine amyloid protein A fibrils, where we first use direct image processing methods to simplify the image data such that a convolutional neural network can be applied to the remaining segmentation problem. Lay Description The ability of protein to form fibrillary structures underlies important cellular functions but can also give rise to disease, such as in a group of disorders, termed amyloid diseases. These diseases are characterised by the formation of abnormal protein filaments, so-called amyloid fibrils, that deposit inside the tissue. Many amyloid fibrils are helically twisted, which leads to periodic variations in the apparent width of the fibril, when observing amyloid fibrils using microscopy techniques like cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Due to the two-dimensional projection, parts of the fibril orthogonal to the projection plane appear narrower than parts parallel to the plane. The parts of small width are called crossovers. The distance between two adjacent crossovers is an important characteristic for the analysis of amyloid fibrils, because it is informative about the fibril morphology and because it can be determined from raw data by eye. A given protein can typically form different fibril morphologies. The morphology can vary depending on the chemical and physical conditions of fibril formation, but even when fibrils are formed under identical solution conditions, different morphologies may be present in a sample. As the crossovers allow to define fibril morphologies in a heterogeneous sample, detecting crossovers is an important first step in the sample analysis. In the present paper, we introduce a method for the automated detection of fibril crossovers in cryo-EM image data. The data consists of greyscale images, each showing an unknown number of potentially overlapping fibrils. In a first step, techniques from image analysis and pattern detection are employed to detect single fibrils in the raw data. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the locations of crossovers on each single fibril. As these predictions may contain errors, further postprocessing steps assess the quality and may slightly alter or reject the predicted crossovers.","Amyloid fibril,convolutional neural network,electron microscopy,semantic segmentation",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Microscopy,,1.855,,JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jmi.12858,

Using robots for automatic floor egg collection offers a novel solution to reduce labor yet relies on robust egg detection systems. This study sought to develop vision-based floor-egg detectors using three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), i.e., single shot detector (SSD), faster region-based CNN (faster R-CNN), and region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN), and evaluate their performance on floor egg detection under simulated CF environments. The results show that the SSD detector had the highest precision (99.9 +/- 0.1%) and fastest processing speed (125.1 +/- 2.7 msimage(-1)) but the lowest recall (72.1 +/- 7.2%) and accuracy (72.0 +/- 7.2%) among the three floor-egg detectors. The R-FCN detector had the slowest processing speed (243.2 +/- 1.0 msimage(1)) and the lowest precision (93.3 +/- 2.4%). The faster R-CNN detector had the best performance in floor egg detection with the highest recall (98.4 +/- 0.4%) and accuracy (98.1 +/- 0.3%), and a medium prevision (99.7 +/- 0.2%) and image processing speed (201.5 +/- 2.3 msimage(-1)); thus, the faster R-CNN detector was selected as the optimal model. The faster R-CNN detector performed almost perfectly for floor egg detection under a wide range of simulated CF environments and system settings, except for brown egg detection at 1 lux light intensity. When tested under random settings, the faster R-CNN detector had 91.9-94.7% precision, 99.8-100.0% recall, and 91.9-94.5% accuracy for floor egg detection. It is concluded that a properly-trained CNN floor-egg detector may accurately detect floor eggs under CF housing environments and has the potential to serve as a crucial vision-based component for robotic floor egg collection systems.","floor egg,convolutional neural network,tensorflow,cage-free,evaluation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"PERFORMANCE,RECOGNITION,BEHAVIOR,HENS",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7013917?pdf=render,

Clustering functional data using FPCA can be an important area in machine learning for signal processing, in particular, for signals that contain a deterministic component. Also, FPCA can be useful for analysis of random signals if an appropriate transformation is applied. In this work, we propose a novel approach by extracting key features of EEG signals in the Fourier spectral domain using FPCA. By first transforming EEG signals into their Fourier power spectra, the functionality of signals is greatly enhanced. Due to this improvement, the application of FPCA becomes much more meaningful in signal feature extraction.

Electromagnetic coupling in asymmetric CNT dimers split the CNT plasmonic resonances into two distinct resonances known as the bonding and anti-bonding modes. The proximity of an external nano-particle (NP) to the CNT dimer perturbs the dimer's near-field distribution and causes different shifts in the bonding and anti-bonding resonances depending on the NP location. We have studied one such case of the NP sensing system, where the NP is lying on the dimer plane and moving perpendicular to the dimer axis. The NP movement is divided into six regions around the dimer and a dataset is created for 150 different locations of the NP by mapping them to the relative shifts in bonding and anti-bonding resonances. Finally, a tree-based machine learning algorithm is applied to fit the training data and predict the NP location for a given random pair of relative shifts in bonding and anti-bonding resonances. This new sensing modality predicts the NP location correctly in 90% of the test cases.","Anti-bonding modes,bonding modes,carbon nanotubes (CNTs),dimers,sensors,tree-based classification method",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Telecommunications",,,,,,

The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system.
OBJECTIVE: One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images.
METHODS: Due to the scarcity of the COVID-19 benchmark dataset, we have employed deep transfer learning techniques, where we examined 15 different pre-trained CNN models to find the most suitable one for this task.
RESULTS: A total of 860 images (260 COVID-19 cases, 300 healthy and 300 pneumonia cases) have been employed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, where 70% images of each class are accepted for training, 15% is used for validation, and rest is for testing.

This article aims at understanding the dephosphorization process through end-point P-content in BOF steelmaking based on data-mining techniques. Dephosphorization is often quantified through the partition ratio (l(p)) which is the ratio of wt% P in slag to wt% P in steel. Instead of predicting the values of l(p), the present study focuses on the classification of final steel based on slag chemistry and tapping temperature. This classification signifies different degrees ('High', 'Moderate', 'Low', and 'Very Low') to which phosphorus is removed in the BOF. Data of slag chemistry and tapping temperature collected from approximately 16,000 heats from two steel plants (Plant I and II) were assigned to four categories based on unsupervised K-means clustering method. An efficient decision tree-based twin support vector machines (TWSVM) algorithm was implemented for category classification. Decision trees were constructed using the concepts: Gaussian mixture model (GMM), mean shift (MS) and affinity propagation (AP) algorithm. The accuracy of the predicted classification was assessed using the classification rate (CR). Model validation was carried out with a five-fold cross validation technique. The fitted model was compared in terms of CR with a decision tree-based support vector machines (SVM) algorithm applied to the same data. The highest accuracy (>= 97%) was observed for the GMM-TWSVM model, implying that by manipulating the slag components appropriately using the structure of the model, a greater degree of P-partition can be achieved in BOF.","dephosphorization,machine learning,BOF steelmaking,twin support vector machines,decision tree,gaussian mixture modeling,K-means clustering,mean shift,affinity propagation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Materials Science,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",,2.487,"HOT,METAL,DEPHOSPHORIZATION,POINT,PHOSPHORUS-CONTENT,STEEL,DEPHOSPHORIZATION,SIMULATION-MODEL,PREDICTION",METALS,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/10/1/25/pdf,

In this paper, the current trends in the process system engineering tasks of modeling, design, and optimization in multiphase systems, are analyzed. Different scales of size and time are included, and therefore, the analysis includes modeling at the molecular level (molecular dynamic modeling) and unit operation level (e.g., computational fluid dynamic, CFD), and the application of optimization for the design of a plant. New strategies for the modeling, design, and optimization of multiphase systems are also included, with a strong focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and the combination of experimentation and modeling with response surface methodology (RSM). The integration of different modeling techniques such as CFD with discrete element simulation (DEM) and response surface methodology (RSM) with artificial neural networks (ANN) is included. The paper finishes with tools to study the uncertainty, both epistemic and stochastic, based on uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses, which is present in all mineral processing operations. It is shown that all of these areas are very active and can help in the understanding, operation, design, and optimization of mineral processing that involves multiphase systems.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O) is widely used to solve the food flavor evaluation problem, but the olfactometry evaluation is unfeasible to be carried out in large batches and is unreliable due to potential issue of an operator or systematic laboratory effect. Thus, a novel fingerprint modeling and profiling process was proposed based on several machine learning models including convolutional neural network (CNN). The fingerprint template was created by the data analysis of existing GC-MS spectrum dataset. Then the fingerprint image generation program was applied for structuring the complex instrumental data. Food olfactometry result was obtained by a machine learning method based on CNN using fingerprint image as the input.

The traditional method of external deformation monitoring and data analysis for HCRFDs is to use a total station for small angle observations and establish a regression model to analyze the results. However, the small angle method has low accuracy and a low automation degree, and there is multicollinearity between the independent variables, which affects the parameter estimation and leads to the failure of model establishment. The angle forward intersection method is adopted in this paper for observation, and an improved partial least squares method (IPLS) is proposed to eliminate the multicollinearity of the independent variables. Compared to the traditional method, the improved observation method exhibits high accuracy and a high automation degree. The new data analysis method can not only eliminate multicollinearity but also improve the interpretation ability of the model. The data from the initial stage of water storage shows that the displacement increases with the increase in the upstream water level and time, and the speed of water storage is proportional to the displacement. The water level and time are the main influencing factors. This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for reservoir management departments to control water levels and gate opening and closing. The method in this paper can be applied to arch dams, gravity dams, and other types of waterpower engineering systems.","angle forward intersection method,high core rock-fill dams (HCRFD),improved partial least squares method,machine learning,geodetic control network,total station",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"COMPONENT,ANALYSIS,GEODETIC,CONTROL,MODEL",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7014218?pdf=render,

The area of space in which the acoustic wave occurs is defined as the acoustic field. When the vibrating surface-for example, the surface of the belt-becomes the source, then one can observe the travelling of surface waves. For any shape of the surface of the dried strawberry fruit, the signal of travelling waves takes the form that is imposed by this irregular surface. The aim of this work was to research the effectiveness of recognizing the two trials in the process of convection drying on the basis of the acoustic signal backed up by neural networks. The input variables determined descriptors such as frequency (Hz) and the level of luminosity (dB). During the research, the degree of crispiness relative to the degree of maturity was compared. The results showed that the optimal neural model in respect of the lowest value of the root mean square turned out to be the Multi-Layer Perceptron network with the technique of dropping single fruits into water (data included in the learning data set Z2). The results confirm that the choice of method can have an influence on the effectives of recognizing dried strawberry fruits, and also this can be a basis for creating an effective and fast analysis tool which is capable of analyzing the degree of ripeness of fruits including their crispness in the industrial process of drying fruits.","Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),classification,strawberry,convection drying,acoustic signals,texture analysis",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"MICROWAVE-VACUUM,DRYING,METHODS,HOT-AIR,QUALITY,WATERMELON,VISION,FRUITS",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014237,

However, the technique suffers from a high error rate. To improve this technology, there is a need to decrease the measurement error which is reported to be more than 30% for an in vivo measurement setting. This work investigates the machine learning (ML) algorithms' ability to decrease the measurement error of open-ended coaxial probe techniques to enable tissue characterization devices. To explore the potential of this technique as a tissue characterization device, performances of multiclass ML algorithms on collected in vivo rat hepatic tissue and phantom dielectric property data were evaluated. Phantoms were used for investigating the potential of proliferating the data set due to difficulty of in vivo data collection from tissues. The dielectric property measurements were collected from 16 rats with hepatic anomalies, 8 rats with healthy hepatic tissues, and in house phantoms. Three ML algorithms, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), logistic regression (LR), and random forests (RF) were used to classify the collected data. The best performance for the classification of hepatic tissues was obtained with 76% accuracy using the LR algorithm. The LR algorithm performed classification with over 98% accuracy within the phantom data and the model generalized to in vivo dielectric property data with 48% accuracy. These findings indicate first, linear models, such as logistic regression, perform better on dielectric property data sets. Second, ML models fitted to the data collected from phantom materials can partly generalize to in vivo dielectric property data due to the discrepancy between dielectric property variability.","hepatic malignancies,in vivo dielectric properties,machine learning,k-nearest neighbors (kNN),logistic regression (LR),random forests (RF),liver phantoms",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"IN-VIVO,BIOLOGICAL,TISSUES,MICROWAVE,LIVER,GHZ",SENSORS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7014510?pdf=render,

Due to these characteristics, sEMG is widely used in human-computer interaction, clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation medicine, sports medicine and other fields. This paper aims to improve the estimation accuracy and real-time performance, in the case of the knee joint angle in the lower limb, using a sEMG signal, in a proposed estimation algorithm of the continuous motion, based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and the regularized extreme learning machine (RELM). First, the sEMG signals, collected during the lower limb motion, are preprocessed, while feature samples are extracted from the acquired and preconditioned sEMG signals. Next, the feature samples dimensions are reduced by the PCA, as well as the knee joint angle system is measured by the three-dimensional motion capture system, are followed by the normalization of the feature variable value. The normalized sEMG feature is used as the input layer, in the RELM model, while the joint angle is used as the output layer. After training, the RELM model estimates the knee joint angle of the lower limbs, while it uses the root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient and model training time as key performance indicators (KPIs), to be further discussed. The RELM, the traditional BP neural network and the support vector machine (SVM) estimation results are compared. The conclusions prove that the RELM method, not only has ensured the validity of results, but also has greatly reduced the learning train time.

The process has high uncertainty during the interaction between the abrasives and the underneath surface, therefore the theoretical material removal models developed in belt grinding involve assumptions. A conclusive material removal model can be developed in such a dynamic process involving multiple parameters using statistical regression techniques. Six different regression modelling methodologies, namely multiple linear regression, stepwise regression, artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR) and random forests (RF) have been applied to the experimental data determined using the Taguchi design of experiments (DoE). The results obtained by the six models have been assessed and compared. All five models, except multiple linear regression, demonstrated a relatively low prediction error. Regarding the influence of the examined belt grinding parameters on the material removal, inference from some statistical models shows that the grit size has the most substantial effect. The proposed regression models can likely be applied for achieving desired material removal by defining process parameter levels without the need to conduct physical belt grinding experiments.","abrasive belt grinding,predictive model,regression",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,2.612,"FUZZY,INFERENCE,SYSTEM,SURFACE,TEXTURE,SIMULATION,PREDICTION,CONTACT,WEAR",SYMMETRY-BASEL,https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/empa/islandora/object/empa%3A22210/datastream/PDF/Pandiyan-2020-Modelling_of_material_removal_in-%28published_version%29.pdf,
