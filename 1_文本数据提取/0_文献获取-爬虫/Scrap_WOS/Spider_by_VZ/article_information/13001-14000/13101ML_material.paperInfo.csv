2,Approximation Of Stress-Strain Curve Of Rubber-Like Material Using An Artificial Neural Network,,,221-226,"Vodka Oleksii,Pogrebnyak Sergii","Vodka O,Pogrebnyak S",Vodka O,,Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine,"Neural networks are widely used in various fields, including computer simulation and mechanics. Neural networks allow solving problems in mechanics with parameters that are poorly formalized. Rubber-like materials have a complex deformation curve. Therefore, the approximation of such a curve can be performed using a neural network. The objective of the work is to create a set of neural networks with different input parameters and internal structure. These neural networks are used for interpolation and approximation of experimental data. To do this, it is constructed and trained neural networks of direct distribution. The training is carried out by the method of back error propagation. The data set was generated based on the results of the experiment. For testing, all networks received the same dataset that was not used during the training but was known from the experiment. This allows determining the network error for the loading cycle area and the root mean square deviation. It is described in detail the type of network and its topology, the method of training, and the preparation of the training sample.","artificial neural network,computer modeling,artificial intelligence,approximation,interpolation,software",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,"MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,COMPOSITES,PREDICTION,BEHAVIOR,TENSILE,STEELS,MODEL",2020 IEEE KHPI WEEK ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY (KHPI WEEK),,

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a very promising and perspective technology in the area of medical images processing, where it could contribute to diagnostics becoming easier and more reliable. Accurate diagnosis is an important factor in the selection of proper and effective treatment. In this paper, a self-constructed convolutional neural network trained on a relatively small dataset for classification of lung X-ray images is presented. This CNN enables classification into one of three categories: healthy, those with bacterial pneumonia, and those with viral pneumonia. Such classification, that considers pneumonia distinction, is rather uncommon among scientific publications. Also, a comparative analysis of the degree of impact of data augmentation on the model's performance and prevention of overfitting was performed. The obtained accuracy of the categorical classification has reached the level of 85% while the sensitivity was equal 0.95. Such results are promising for further work and improvement.","Pneumonia,Convolutional neural network,Image classification,Data augmentation",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,,,,,

Still, while ML offers the potential to extract a substantially more information and predict diseases with better accuracy, it is also intrinsically more computationally expensive. Given the importance of this field and recent advances, we present a survey on ML approaches to ECG processing, focusing on particular diseases and conditions that can be detected and the different algorithms used for that.

The idea here is that highly customized products can move dynamically and autonomously through a system of flexible workstations without fixed production cycles. This approach has challenging demands regarding planning and organization of such systems. Since each product can define its way through the system freely and individually, implementing rules and heuristics that leverage the flexibility in the system in order to increase performance can be difficult in this dynamic environment. Transport tasks are usually carried out by automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Therefore, integration of AI-based control logics offer a promising alternative to manually implemented decision rules for operating the AGVs.

The models were validated at both national and farm scales. Multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models were created and compared. National scale cross-validation of the models gave the following R-2 values for predictions of Cu (R-2 = 0.63), Zn (R-2 = 0.92), and Cd (R-2 = 0.70) concentrations. Independent validation at the farm scale revealed that Zn predictions were relatively successful regardless of the model used (R-2 > 0.90), showing that a simple MLR model can be sufficient for certain predictions. However, predictions at the farm scale revealed that the non-linear models, especially MARS, were more accurate than MLR for Cu (R-2 = 0.94) and Cd (R-2 = 0.80). These results show that multivariate modelling can compensate for some of the shortcomings of the PXRF device (e.g., high limits of detection for certain elements and some elements not being directly measurable), making PXRF sensors capable of predicting elemental concentrations in soil at comparable levels of accuracy to conventional laboratory analyses.","PXRF,soil,copper,zinc,cadmium,machine learning,precision agriculture",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"SPECTROMETRY,METALS",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014454,

Therefore, in HEAs, several different chemical elements coexist in one phase. Interaction between multiple species in one phase is of interest, since understanding of features of this interactions can provide understanding of thermodynamics stability of such systems. As far as properties of solid alloy are connected with properties of its melt, it is reasonable to start the investigation of particular multi-component system from liquid state. However, the problem of describing of potential energy surface (PES) for metals is especially vexing. For solving this problem here we applied machine learning technique, namely DEEPMD approach, for developing neural-network potential (NNP) for molten TiZrHfNb as an example of multi-component system. Training set was generated using oh initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. Validation of the potential was performed by comparing of partial radial distribution functions (PRDFs) obtained by AIMD and DEEPMD methods.

Retrospective correction strategies usually cope with motion by fast imaging sequences with integrated motion tracking under free-movement conditions. These acquisitions perform sub-Nyquist sampling and retrospectively bin the data into the respective motion states, yielding subsampled and motion-resolved k-space data. The motion-resolved k-spaces are linked to each other by non-rigid deformation fields. The accurate estimation of such motion is thus an important task in the successful correction of respiratory and cardiac motion. Usually this problem is formulated in image space via diffusion, parametric-spline or optical flow methods. Image-based registration can be however impaired by aliasing artifacts or by estimation from low-resolution images. Subsequently, any motion-corrected reconstruction can be biased by errors in the deformation fields.

As adversarial images are created by adding noise, we focus on the behavior of outputs of image classifier for differently filtered images. Our idea is to observe the outputs by changing the strength of a noise removal filtering operation, which is called operation-oriented characteristics. With the increase of the strength, the output from a softmax function in an image classifier is drastically changed in case of adversarial images, while it is rather stable in case of normal images. We investigate the operation-oriented characteristics for some noise removal operations and the propose a simple detector of adversarial images.

Due to this unique nature of the problem, where one error greatly outweighs the other, traditional machine learning techniques, even with much improved accuracy, may not be ideal as they do not provide a way to control the false negatives below a certain threshold. To address this need, a classification algorithm that can control the false negatives to a certain threshold is proposed. The theoretical foundation for this algorithm is based on Neyman-Pearson (NP) Lemma, which is used to construct a novel tree-based classifier that enables asymmetric error control. This classifier is evaluated on the data obtained from the Framingham heart study and it predicts the risk of a ten-year cardiac disease, not only with improved accuracy and F1 score but also with full control over the number of false negatives. With an improved accuracy in predicting cardiac disease, this tree-based classifier with asymmetric error control can reduce the burden of cardiac disease in populations and potentially save a lot of human lives.

However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATE'S, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.","Device-free Localization,PIR sensors,Inverse filter,Particle filter",Proceedings Paper,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,,"DEVICE-FREE,LOCALIZATION,HUMAN,TRACKING",MOBICOM '20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE COMPUTING AND NETWORKING (MOBICOM 2020),,

The effective localization of lesions is performed using different image processing and computer vision techniques. Lately, the usage of deep learning models into medical imaging from detection to prediction shown that is a powerful tool for Computer-aided software. In this paper, we present an approach to localize pulmonary lung lesion using fuzzy deep learning. Our approach uses a simple convolutional neural network based using the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

With current demands for sustainable development, the researchers developed a waste segregator machine that satisfies efficient segregation and introduces the concept of reward system to motivate people to throw their waste into the machine. In this paper, the researchers created an automatic segregating machine that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as an algorithm for machine learning and embedded with the concept of ""Basura Advantage Points"". The ANN acts as the brain of the machine for sorting out the plastic bottles as one category and other waste materials for the other category. The ""Basura Advantage Points"" is a novel concept wherein whenever people throw a garbage into the segregating machine, they can earn points which can then be used to redeem awards set by policy makers. Survey results show that the machine is appealing to the public. Based on the sample wastes, the accuracy of the machine is around 80 percent.

That is, machine learning-aided material design and/or discovery is an emerging research topic, but one that holds immense potential. Such a system could, theoretically, be used to discover novel materials or surfaces that possess desirable properties across the electromagnetic spectrum under specific conditions. Herein, we present our preliminary machine learning-based framework for novel material design and discovery. We emphasize that our proposed framework is in its infancy; however, it is laying the foundation for the discovery of fundamental theories and knowledge for this novel technology. Baseline elementary experiments are presented as a proof-of-concept to show the feasibility of our proposed framework for the task of material design. Specifically, we put forth a multi-stage machine learning framework for new material discovery considering material surface geometries for predicting object signatures in the X band. Our proposed multi-stage framework is structured as follows: 1) a deep neural network (NN) is trained for predicting the time response scattered from an object based upon surface geometries (micro-feature spacing, height, etc.); and 2) a genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimal surface geometry configuration whose predicted scattered response (closely) matches that of a desired object response in the X band.","genetic algorithms,machine learning,neural networks",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

This paper proposes a Hierarchical Boundary Sensitive Residual U-net (HBS-RUnet) model with self-paced learning strategy for prostate segmentation in MR image. Instead of regarding the segmentation task independently, our network consists of two branches: one segmentation branch detects the prostate region and the boundary branch finds prostate shape. The outputs of boundary branch are employed to refine the HBS-RUnet model by adding a boundary regularization, which helps to lind desirable and spatially consistent prostate region. Moreover, a hierarchical dynamic self-paced learning strategy is proposed to measure the difficulty for each prostate image and gradually select the relatively simpler samples for model training. Such a simple-to-complex learning strategy could robustly lean: image features and enable the robust prostate segmentation.

One of the symptoms negatively interfering with daily activities is kinetic tremor which should be measured to monitor the outcome of therapy. A new instrumented method of quantification of the kinetic tremor is proposed, based on the analysis of circles drawn on a digitizing tablet by a patient. The aim of this approach is to obtain a tremor scoring equivalent to that performed by trained clinicians. Models are trained with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to predict the tremor scores on the basis of the parameters computed from the patients' drawings. Signal parametrization is derived from both expert knowledge and the response of an artificial neural network to the raw data, thus the approach was named multimodal. The fitted models are eventually combined into model ensembles that provide aggregated scores of the kinetic tremor captured in the drawings. The method was verified with a set of clinical data acquired from 64 Parkinson's disease patients. Automated and objective quantification of the kinetic tremor with the presented approach yielded promising results, as the Pearson's correlations between the visual ratings of tremor and the model predictions ranged from 0.839 to 0.890 in the best-performing models.","Parkinson's disease,kinetic tremor,digitizing tablet,echo state network,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"ECHO,STATE,NETWORKS,REGRESSION,CLASSIFICATION",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6983132,

At the same time, the rapid development of the Human Genome Project and gene microarray technology has enabled the activity of many genes in the patient's body to be intuitively measured through the chip. The rapid development of machine learning has contributed to the data mining and medical science of this DNA microarray technology.

Firstly, we perform simple data cleaning and normalization processing on clinical data and genetic data; second, perform differential gene screening; next, select principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, nuclear principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling algorithms to reduce the dimensional of the data.

The clinical data is manually selected and classified using machine learning. Finally, the results of clinical data and genetic data are combined to predict the site of recurrence.

Hence, it is of great importance to characterize the complex polarization state to interpret the associated phenomena in ferroelectric materials. In particular, recent progress on high-performance materials with exotic nanoscale polarization heterogeneity requires advanced technology on probing local structure for ferroelectrics. In this work, we employed a high-throughput scanning convergent beam electron diffraction (SCBED) method to investigate the local structure of (Ba0.78Ca0.22)(Ti0.88Sn0.12)O-3 ceramics by using a transmission electron microscope. The obtained patterns were further analyzed by the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Bayesian machine-learning algorithm to recognize polar axes and their spatial distribution. The results show the coexistence of cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystal symmetries among nanodomains, which suggest a reduced polarization anisotropy. Our work may provide an effective approach to characterize the complex polarization state in ferroelectric materials, which enables the establishment of structure-property relationship for high-property functional dielectric materials.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,,,,,

Therefore, a lot of experience and expert knowledge is necessary to produce parts with high quality. Changes in granule-batches, environmental influences and wear of the machine and the mould can strongly affect the quality of the produced parts. For this reason an injection moulding machine needs an experienced operator, who reacts properly to changing input variables and sets appropriate countermeasures. Modern injection moulding machines are able to record all countermeasures and have access to a wealth of internal machine data. Consequently, an adequate machine learning (ML) method should be able to observe, to learn the proper countermeasures and to evaluate their effectiveness. With deep learning (DL), a state of the art technology in ML, it will be possible to predictively detect process anomalies for the first time, based only on the knowledge about the internal machine data. If an operator changes the setting parameters of the injection moulding machine, the correlation between the adjustment and the anomaly is being learnt. The aim is to get process adjustment recommendations from the machine learning system.
This is a fundamentally new approach for process management in injection moulding, as the machine learning system detects problems long before they can be seen by an operator. Furthermore, the system provides process adjustment recommendations, based on the supervised and automatically generalized actions from different operators using different injection moulding machines, moulds and materials.","Injection moulding,Machine learning,Process anomalies",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Polymer Science,,,,ADVANCES IN POLYMER PROCESSING 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLASTICS TECHNOLOGY,,

Automated segmentation facilitates quick processing since it requires relatively less time to process more images. Conventional computer based segmentation methods require extensive support for determining the features. Users develop the features and provide to the system which then utilize those features to delineate the required regions.

Such technologies are coming to prominence for devices requiring high bandwidth memory in emerging applications such as self-driving cars, machine learning and real-time speech processing [1-3].
In 'via-middle' process flows, the TSVs are exposed from the back side of the wafer by grind and plasma etch steps. Dielectric layers deposited using Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) serve to passivate and mechanically support the exposed TSV prior to bump/RDL formation and then chip-to-wafer or wafer-to-wafer bonding.
Prior to via reveal processing, device wafers are bonded to silicon or glass carriers and thinned to around 50 mu m. The temporary bonding material imposes a temperature constraint of similar to 190 degrees C during all subsequent via reveal process steps. This temperature constraint is especially challenging for the PECVD passivation processes where films with stable electrical and mechanical properties are required.
Controlling PECVD film stress is also critical as stresses can cause excessive wafer bow in thinned wafers unless countermeasures are taken. While average stress must be controlled, it is also critical to minimize within-wafer stress as this will impact die-level bow and affect subsequent die-attach processes.
In this paper, we report on silicon nitride (SiN) - silicon oxide (SiO) stacks deposited at <190 degrees C which give excellent electrical properties with leakage current densities <1E-9 A.cm-2 and breakdown voltages >10 MV.cm-1. These films are also optimized in terms of step coverage and stress characteristics.

The diagnosis of OSA is made by a specialist doctor according to the records obtained with the polysomnography device. However, the diagnostic process is quite troublesome. More than 30 signals are recorded for diagnosis. This may cause discomfort to the patient during the night. For the diagnosis, sleep staging and respiratory scoring are performed with the records collected via the polysomnography device. With sleep staging, the patient's sleep and awake times are determined and respiratory scoring is used to detect abnormal respiratory events that occur during sleep. If more than 5 abnormal respiratory events occur per hour, the individual is diagnosed with OSA. Due to the fact that this process is laborious and uncomfortable to the individual, practical diagnostic methods are needed. In this study, an easy and practical measurement system for sleep staging, which is an important step in the diagnosis of OSA, will be proposed. According to this system, sleep/awake state is determined by electrocardiogram signal (ECG) and a machine based method.
ECG records obtained from two individuals will be used in the study. First, the ECG signal will be cleared from the noise by digital filters. It will then be divided into 30 s epochs for sleep staging. From each separated epoch, 25 features will be extracted and features associated with sleep/awake will be selected with the help of feature selection algorithms. Determined features will be classified by Support Vector Machine which is a machine learning method and the system performance will be tested. In the preliminary studies, it was determined that 25 properties were related to sleep/awake stages and that the classification performance was approximately 85%. In light of this information, it is thought that a system based on machine learning can be developed for the detection of sleep/awake stages using ECG signals for the diagnosis of OSA.","Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Electrocardiogram,Feature selection,Machine learning,Support Vector Machines",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Mathematics,Telecommunications",,,,,,

It is essential to periodically monitor the heart beat arrhythmia to reduce the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Visual Geometry Group network (VGGNet) is being widely used in computer vision problems. However, the same network cannot be used for classification of ECG beats as ECG signal is different from image signal in terms of dimensionality and inherent features. Thus, the authors investigated the effect of decreasing depth and width of a convolutional neural network in context of cardiac arrhythmia classification. In this paper, six configurations differing in depth and width are evaluated using benchmark MIT-BIH database. A deep network having thirteen convolution layers but with a smaller number of filters (reduced width) showed outstanding performance for the given problem. Based on the findings, the work is further extended to propose an improved convolutional neural network named as modified VGGNet (mVGGNet) for the task of ECG arrhythmia classification into four classes which are normal (N), ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and fusion beat (F). The hyper-parameters of the proposed architecture were optimized using sequential model based global optimization (SMBO) algorithm. The proposed architecture is evaluated using subjected-oriented patient-independent evaluation protocol. The performance is evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. The proposed mVGGNet achieved 98.79% and 99.16% accuracy for ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB) classification respectively.

The advantage of this approach is that CNN learns to extract the optimal damage-sensitive features from the raw dynamical response data automatically without the need of computing and selecting hand-crafted features manually.

This work presents a novel study on the effect of familiarity on recognition of pleasant (positive) and unpleasant (negative) emotional states induced by Hindi music videos. For this, we recorded 32-channel EEG from six healthy subjects while they watched Hindi music videos and self-reported ratings of felt emotions on valence and familiarity scale. We used a machine learning framework for emotion classification from power spectral and functional connectivity features. The framework consists of SVD-QRcp and F-ratio based feature selection and an SVM classifier. The classification was performed under three cases of familiarity, namely, familiar, unfamiliar, and regardless of familiarity of the music videos. We found that for the familiar case, the classification performance was higher than unfamiliar and regardless of familiarity cases for all considered features. The best performing features were from the individual electrodes and these features were from the frontal and left parietal regions which indicate the lateralized processing of valence. In addition to classification, we analyzed the feature and electrode usage for all the cases of familiarity.
