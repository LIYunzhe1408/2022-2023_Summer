1,Automatic Detection of Cursor Movements from the EEG Signals via Deep Learning Approach,,,327-332,"Polat Hasan,Ozerdem Mehmet Sirac","Polat H,Ozerdem MS",Polat H,,Bingol University,"The classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks is one of the key objectives of EEC-based brain-computer interface (BC!) systems. To ensure successful classification performance to BCI systems, researchers endeavor to extract appropriate features. However, these challenges are based on the conventional method. In this study, EEG signals related to MI tasks are classified using the convolutional neural network (CNN), which does not need a separate feature extraction. EEG records, which are generally evaluated as one-dimensional in machine learning problems, were taken into consideration as the image representation by using a novel method. The datasets were taken from a healthy subject. The subject was asked to move a cursor up and down on a computer screen, while his cortical potentials were taken. The EEG signals recorded over the 3.5-second time interval were evaluated for both the whole time and sub time intervals. Thus, the most effective time interval that has distinguishing features for EEG recordings related to different cursor movements was tried to be determined as well. As a result, it has been shown that the proposed model based on deep learning approach can successfully classify EEG signals related to cursor movements.","EEG,Deep Learning,Convolutional Neural Networks,Classification",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"IMPROVING,CLASSIFICATION,FEATURE-EXTRACTION,DECOMPOSITION",2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,
2,Deep Learning Approach to Cell Classificatio in Human Peripheral Blood,,,383-387,Ucar Ferhat,Ucar F,Ucar F,,Firat University,"In the health-care sector, things are distinct, unlike other industrial platforms. The priority of the sector is very high and both the players of it and patients need the highest level of services in terms of medical care and diagnostic tools. Almost always, the diagnosis of the medical data is being processed by healthcare experts. When it comes to image analysis, it is thoroughly a challenging process because of the subjective points of view, and possible complexities in the image. Deep learning promises good performance for medical image processing with its success on other real field applications. In this study, a deep learning-based method is proposed for the classification of human peripheral blood cells (PBC). Most of the hematological diseases can be diagnosed with the help of analysis on PBC whilst the morphological interpretation of the abnormalities in PBC is still a complicated process. Hence, this study presents an automated system for the classification of eight types of PBC with a deep learning approach. The proposed model uses a ShuffleNet structure for automatic feature extraction and decision-making with a tremendous dataset. The performance values of the proposed model are high and also the model outperforms the main study that provides the dataset.","deep learning,blood cell automatic classification,peripheral blood cell,shufflenet",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,

This paper aims to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied in the automation of Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) processes, to support medical decisions. The study identified more than 800 articles on the topic in the leading scientific research platforms. To select the most relevant studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, where 45 articles were selected to compose the detailed study of the SRL. The results obtained with the extraction of information from the papers, identified 3 groups of primary studies, namely: identification of the cardiac vision plan, analysis of cardiac functions and detection of cardiac diseases. SRL identifies that the set of Machine learning (ML) techniques are being widely applied in the tasks of segmentation, detection and classification of images obtained from ECHO. The techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), presented the best Accuracy rates. Research shows a strong interest in automating ECHO processes.

It involves increased risk of falls and reduced quality of life, and correlates with motor fluctuations and progression of the disease. Hence, the knowledge of FOG event frequency, duration, daily distribution and response to drug therapy is fundamental for a reliable patient's assessment. In this study, we propose a FOG detection algorithm that takes as input inertial data from a single waist-mounted smartphone, and provides information about presence and duration of FOG episodes. Data acquisition was carried on 38 PD patients and 21 elderly subjects executing a standard 6-minute walking test. More than 3.5 hours of acceleration data have been collected. A combination of Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbour classifiers has been designed. Sensitivity of 95.4%, specificity of 98.8%, precision of 92.8% and accuracy of 983% in the 10-fold cross validation, and a detection rate of 84% in Leave-one-Subject-Out validation were obrained.

Current algorithms can only detect seizures effectively for patients already presented to the classifier. Algorithms which are directed to predict for larger patient populations can struggle to generalize outside the initial training set without proper regularization and can fail to capture seizures from patients. We proposed a data processing pipeline for seizure detection on an intra-patient dataset from the world's largest public EEG seizure corpus. We created spatially and session invariant features by specifically forcing our networks to rely less on exact combinations of channels and signal amplitudes and instead to learn dependencies towards seizure detection. As a baseline result, without any additional regularization on a deep learning model, we could only achieve an F1 score of 0.544. We could increase F1 score to 0.629 using random rearrangements of channels on each minibatch to force the network to generalize to other combinations of channels. We also used random rescale of the data within a small range to further increase F1 score to 0.651 with our best model. In addition, we applied adversarial multi-task learning and achieved similar results. We observe that session and patient specific dependencies were causing overfitting of deep neural networks. We found that the most overfitting models learn features specific only to the EEG data presented but that we can create networks that don't learn patient and session-specific features through regularization. We are the first to use random rearrangement, random rescale, and adversarial multitask learning to regularize specifically for intra-patient seizure detection and have increased sensitivity to 0.86 from our baseline study.","Seizure detection,EEG,Deep learning,Regularization",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,EPILEPSY,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567426,

Epilepsy can affect patients' health and can lead to life-threatening emergencies. Predicting epilepsy before the initiation of the onset is highly effective to avoid the seizure by medication. machine learning algorithms have been implemented in classifying epilepsy from Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. Machine learning algorithms experience reduced performance when classes are imbalanced. The imbalance class problem can be handled by different sampling techniques including oversampling minority class, undersampling majority class, and combined of both. In this paper, both traditional and state-of-the-art sampling techniques have been experimented and evaluated for their capability of improving the imbalance ratio. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) based framework is also presented in this paper.

However, the quality of the reconstructed images depends significantly on the beamforming technique utilized. Although advanced data-adaptive methods of reconstruction such as Minimum Variance (MV) beamforming can recover image quality much higher than conventional techniques, their implementation also entails a heavy computational burden. This dichotomy hinders the ultrasound imaging use as a standalone device in some applications such as early breast cancer detection. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a huge potential when applied to many Artificial intelligence (AI) research fields. In this work, the use of Deep learning in improving the quality of the beamforming technique Delay and Sum (DAS) normally used for ultrasound (US) images reconstruction is explored. Three different architectures are implemented: Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE), Fully Connected network (FC) and U-Net -like architecture. They were trained on datasets simulated using field II. The dataset consists of input-output pairs where the input is Noisy DAS beamformed scan lines and the output is MV beamformed non-noisy scan lines. The networks show a great ability in predicting the beamformed signals along with significantly reducing noise in the reconstructed images. Additionally, the proposed networks improve other image characteristics such as scatterer size and position along with reducing tail characteristic normally found in DAS beamformed ultrasound images. US images constructed by the networks achieved better quality metrics that surpass conventional DAS beamformed images. The CAE, U-net-like architecture, and FC enhanced the signal to noise ratio (SNR) compared to DAS by 218%, 165% and 136% respectively. Additionally, the networks showed higher Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) and Contrast Ratio (CR) metrics than DAS beamformed signals. Finally, the proposed approach achieves a 60% enhancement in time consumption of image reconstruction compared to MV technique, which allows higher possible frame rate with a comparable outcome.","Beamforming,AutoEncoder networks,Ultrasound imaging,Speckle noise",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,,,

A patient's EHR data is organized as a three-level hierarchy from top to bottom: patient journey - all the experiences of diagnoses and treatments over a period of time; individual visit - a set of medical codes in a particular visit; and medical code - a specific record in the form of medical codes. As EHRs begin to amass in millions, the potential benefits, which these data might hold for medical research and medical outcome prediction, are staggering- including, for example, predicting future admissions to hospitals, diagnosing illnesses or determining the efficacy of medical treatments. Each of these analytics tasks requires a domain knowledge extraction method to transform the hierarchical patient journey into a vector representation for further prediction procedure. The representations should embed a sequence of visits and a set of medical codes with a specific timestamp, which are crucial to any downstream prediction tasks. Hence, expressively powerful representations are appealing to boost learning performance. To this end, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism that captures the contextual dependency and temporal relationships within a patient's healthcare journey. An end-to-end bidirectional temporal encoder network (BiteNet) then learns representations of the patient's journeys, based solely on the proposed attention mechanism.

Data imbalance is a common problem in medical images. Dice Loss is widely used in medical image segmentation tasks to address the data imbalance problem. However, it only addresses the imbalance problem between foreground and background yet overlooks another imbalance between easy and hard examples that also severely affects the training process of a learning model. Empirically speaking, an easy example generally contributes less to the overall loss than a hard example. However, in practice, compared with hard examples, a large number of easy examples will be generated from a medical image and will dominate the training model, resulting in sub-optimal training or worse. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Focal Dice Loss to alleviate the imbalance between hard examples and easy examples. Focal Dice Loss is able to reduce the contribution from easy examples and make the model focus on hard examples through our proposed novel balanced sampling strategy during the training process. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed loss functions, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world medical image datasets with 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks. The experimental results show that our proposed Focal Dice Loss brings a significant improvement in segmentation performance compared to Dice Loss.

It mainly consists of two streams: the space-time stream and the space-frequency stream, representing and learning discriminative features in the space-time-frequency dimension. Specifically, each stream contains three key parts: 1) 3D representations of EEG signals depict the spatial information over temporal/spectral distributions; 2) Attention mechanisms adaptively explore attentive dynamics of EEG signals and focus on the most valuable information in separate dimensions; 3) 3D convolutions learn spatial representation, temporal dependence, and spectral dependence.

Confidence estimates are closely related to classification accuracy. While existing neural networks have the capability of extending binary labels to multiclass labels, the confidence calibration procedure is generally overlooked. To address the issue, we propose a method called knowledge discriminator risk network (KDR) and a confidence calibration voting algorithm (KDR-CCV) that together enhance classification accuracy, with an emphasis on confidence calibration. Comparative studies on multiclass classification based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RAIDS) assessment categories with a dataset containing only binary labels of ultrasound images are conducted. Experimental results show KDR-CCV achieves the overall best classification performance in comparison to other methods that conform to the BI-RADS criterion in addition to the effective improvement on classification accuracy. The proposed method incorporates BI-RADS assessment and artificial intelligence from an application-based broad practice, and can be extended to other medical imaging problems.","classification,confidence calibration,deep learning,medical imaging,BI-RADS",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Computer Science,,,,,,

The problem with the string-based approach is its inability to deal with knowledge inference from the text, such as the content, context, relevance, clarity, and interconnection, which can be identified by semantic analysis. The semantic analysis depends mainly on mapping the text into stored knowledge sources, such as WordNet, and analyzing the associations in the underlying knowledge source. In this paper, a semantic-based approach for reflective writing analysis is proposed, in which the input text, which is being analyzed, is mapped into semantic concepts. Moreover, a machine learning (ML) approach for reflective writing identification and analysis has been implemented to overcome the limitations of rule execution and keyword matching. The proposed approach addresses the efficiency of using several effective concepts, correlated with effective words that are identified in WordNet-Affect.

Secondly, data recording issue for diabetes patients is always a big problem in the diagnosis of diabetes type 1 patients. Method: In this research, we input Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to Optimized Artificial Neural Networks (OANN) in order to predict BGL of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

S.","Rissati JV,Molina PC,Anjos CS",Anjos CS,,Instituto Federal do Sul de Minas Gerais,"One of the purposes of hyperspectral remote sensing is to differentiate and identify the materials present on the Earth's surface by the spectral behavior of each object in the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such differentiation and identification can be accomplished through different image classification algorithms. However, there is no perfect classifier, since every algorithm has labeling errors. With the advent of orbital and aerial images of very high spatial and spectral resolution, the recognition of the materials present in urban environments is increasingly accurate. Thus, we thoroughly study different methodologies to identify the algorithm that presents the best results in the characterization of urban objects. The hyperspectral image used in the present study represents an area over Houston University - Texas and its surroundings, containing 48 spectral bands, with a spatial resolution of 1 meter and spectral range of 380 nm to 1050 nm. For the identification of 21 classes present in the study area, this paper analyzes two different classification methods: Deep Learning and Random Forest. To improve classification accuracy, performed the feature extraction. To obtain such preliminary results we used tools available in specific software as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). The image segmentation was performed using two different methods known as Multiresolution Segmentation and Spectral difference. 4ultiresolution segmentation needs parameters related to form and compactness. The best results were obtained with the values of form = 0.7 and compactness = 0.5, besides the scale of 10. From this, samples of all classes contained in the study area were selected for the training of the algorithms. This step is of paramount importance, as sample collection directly impacts the result of the classifications. After performing these steps, the information obtained from sample collection is entered into the data mining software (WEKA 3.8) to train the classification algorithms. The analysis of the results was performed by cross -validation, thus obtained the confusion matrix, calculated the Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Index. The classification by the Random Forest method had an overall accuracy of 84.72% and a Kappa Index of 0.83. In turn, the Deep Learning algorithm had an overall accuracy of 81.32% and a Kappa index of 0.80. In this case, the classification by the Random Forest method presented better results for the hyperspectral image classification than the Deep Learning method. The accuracy difference obtained between the methods is not considered significant, so it is suggested for future work to analyze other complementary issues such as processing time.","Accuracy,Classification Methods,Image Classification,Machine Learning,Remote Sensing,Spatial Resolution,Spectral Resolution,Urban Objects",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Remote Sensing",,,,2020 IEEE LATIN AMERICAN GRSS & ISPRS REMOTE SENSING CONFERENCE (LAGIRS),,

Allergic diseases and especially allergic rhinitis are among the most common diseases in the world, mostly underappreciated, causing considerable impairment of daily activities, including job, and school productivity. For this reason, close monitoring and early recognition of symptoms worsening are considered essential. We hypothesize that recognizing allergic rhinitis to patients by such an approach may be a useful tool for such purpose.
In our study, for the first time, the most common allergic rhinitis gestures are identified, based on patients' description and specialists' experience. Our data is retrieved by a large pool of active allergic rhinitis patients attending three specialized outpatient clinics in Greece. Gestures are recorded with the help of a wristband Bluetooth device incorporating a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. Feature engineering and several signal processing methods are then applied to the raw sensor data (which are treated as 6-dimensional signals), and valuable features are extracted related to the time and frequency domains.
To improve the performance of the Machine Learning models, we utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and we also use functions such as Grid Search and Randomized Search, in order to achieve higher recognition accuracy by hyperparameter optimization.
With these features and steps of processing, we built a classifier that can uniquely identify 15 allergic rhinitis gestures with an accuracy of 93% in a challenging variety of moves in the patient's head (nose, eye, ear). It is worth noting that allergic rhinitis gestures are more subtle, varied and spontaneous than other moves that have been considered in the literature so far. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a Machine Learning approach is successfully applied in such a challenging field like respiratory diseases.","gesture recognition,wearables,machine learning,mobile computing,IoT,allergy,allergic rhinitis,respiratory diseases",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Remote Sensing",,,,,,

The object detection is a common field in computer vision practices, for detecting some important objects in images or videos. In medicine, there is also a need for object detection such as, organ detection. Thus, different types of deep networks have been used in medicine for detecting organs or some parts of organs such as ventricles in heart images. This paper introduces a system based on neural network, used for automated detection in MRI cardiac images of left ventricles. Our work relies upon backpropagation neural network with a sliding window used to go through the images to find and detect the left ventricle. Firstly, network is operated in order to classify left ventricle and non-left ventricle images using a backpropagation techniques neural network. MATLAB program is run and furthermore, BPNN is automatically exercised several times before the detection process is carried out. The trained network is then validated by testing it on unseen data to gain a good generalization capability. The recognition rate achieved by BPNN is 100% on training data, 89.23% on testing data. The trained network is then used to determine if a left ventricle is contained or not in the sampled region.

If done entirely manually, checking whether a given privacy policy complies with GDPR is both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated support for this task is thus advantageous. At the moment, there is an evident lack of such support on the market. In this paper, we tackle an important dimension of GDPR compliance checking for privacy policies. Specifically, we provide automated support for checking whether the content of a given privacy policy is complete according to the provisions stipulated by GDPR. To do so, we present: (1) a conceptual model to characterize the information content envisaged by GDPR for privacy policies, (2) an AI-assisted approach for classifying the information content in GDPR privacy policies and subsequently checking how well the classified content meets the completeness criteria of interest; and (3) an evaluation of our approach through a case study over 24 unseen privacy policies. For classification, we leverage a combination of Natural Language Processing and supervised Machine Learning.

Such images encompasses a wide range of lesions and hence early diagnosis can be of vital importance. The proposed model learns the collective features of various inflammatory lesion subgroups and aggregates that information to solve a binary classification problem by distinguishing between normal and abnormal frames. The proposed model has one primary and three secondary branches. The primary branch resembles a generic CNN model with convolution and max-pooling layers whereas the secondary branches consist of dilated convolution layers and max-pooling layers.

Also early detection reduces the risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular anomalies. Due to its wide availability and low cost, ultrasound images of carotid artery has the ability and potential to gain the preference over other resources for plaque detection and analysis in medical practice. However, the difficulty caused in automated techniques to identify plaques is significantly due to image noise, plaque size and the complex appearance of tissues comprising a plaque. So, in this paper, we have addressed this problem by using deep learning techniques such as CNN algorithm. Here we will build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that will extract features from the dataset of images thereby giving detailed information which will help the clinicians to identify the abnormalities and constituents of different plaques in an image and report the image as ""normal"" or ""abnormal"".

Common treatments include intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents such as aflibercept. However, lack of response in some patients makes prediction of posttreatment VA difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model to predict posttreatment VA using pretreatment medical imaging and patient profile data. The proposed model works with image data (optical coherence tomography and color fundus photograph) and patient profile data including gender, age, affected side and pretreatment decimal visual acuity. The model was tested by comparing mean square errors (MSE) between actual and predicted visual acuity obtained from input of image data alone, input of patient profile data alone, and input of both types of data. When examining the concatenation effectiveness of input of both types of data, the outcomes of concatenation conditions 100:100 and 500:500 were compared. For concatenation condition 100:100, MSE was 0.081 for input of image data alone, 0.052 for input of patient profile data alone, and 0.058 for input of both types of data. For concatenation condition 500:500, the MSE values were 0.081, 0.052, and 0.047, respectively. The model proposed provides highly accurate prediction of posttreatment VA and indication of recovery to physicians and patients.

The potential of hyperspectral imaging has been established for decades. However, to date hyperspectral imaging has only seen success in specialized and large-scale industrial and military applications. This is mainly due to the high cost of hyperspectral cameras (upwards of $20K) and the complexity of the acquisition system which makes the technology out of reach for many commercial and end-user applications. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach to convert RGB image sequences taken by regular cameras to (partial) hyperspectral images. This can enable, for example, low-cost mobile phones to leverage the characteristics of hyperspectral images in implementing novel applications. We show the benefits of the conversion model by designing a vein localization and visualization application that traditionally uses hyperspectral images. Our application uses only RGB images and produces accurate results. Vein visualization is important for point-of-care medical applications. We collected hyperspectral data to validate the proposed conversion model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising and can bring some of the benefits of expensive hyperspectral cameras to the low-cost and pervasive RGB cameras, enabling many new applications and enhancing the performance of others. We also evaluate the vein visualization application and show its accuracy.","hyperspectral imaging,vein visualization",Proceedings Paper,"ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY, 1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Computer Science,,,"RECOVERY,SPECTRA",MMSYS'20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS CONFERENCE,,

Because SEM images are pixel dose maps, deep learning (DL) offers an attractive alternative to the tedious and error-prone mask analysis performed by the operators and expert field application engineers in today's mask shops. However, production demands preclude collecting a large enough variety and number of real SEM images to effectively train deep learning models. We have found that digital twins that can mimic the SEM images derived from CAD data provide an exceptional way to synthesize ample data to train effective DL models. Previous studies [1, 2, 3, 4] have shown how deep learning can be used to create digital twins. However, it was unclear if SEM images generated with digital twins would have sufficient quality to train a deep learning network to classify real SEM images. This paper shows how we built three DL tools for SEM-based mask analysis. The first tool automatically filters good quality SEM images, particularly for test chips, using a DL-based binary classifier. A second tool uses another DL model to align CAD and SEM images for applications where it is important that features on both the images are properly aligned. A third tool uses a DL multi-class classifier to categorize various types of VSB mask writer defects. In developing the three tools, we trained state-of-the-art deep neural networks on SEM images generated using digital twins to achieve accurate results on real SEM images.

The heat exchange during the cooling process of the strip is a very complicated nonlinear process, which is difficult to accurately express with mathematical models. However, data-driven models can represent nonlinear processes very well. This paper uses data-driven temperature prediction of the finishing rolling inlet for the full length of the slab surface, and uses the factors related to the full length temperature of the rolled slab surface in the hot continuous rolling line as training data to predict the next full surface temperature at the finishing rolling inlet. Aiming at the problems of traditional prediction models that have low accuracy, many input parameters, and difficult prediction, a gray wolf algorithm optimized BP neural network (GWO-BP) prediction model is proposed.

In this paper, a random forest prediction model based on principal component dimensionality reduction and artificial bee colony dynamic search fusion is proposed to predict the power consumption prediction of multi-standard rolling stock in strip hot rolling finishing control section. The accurate prediction of the power consumption of the rolling section is realized with methods including data dimensionality reduction and parameter optimization.

However, individual differences of cortical responses from the BCI users has become an obstacle to inter-subject emotion recognition. In this study, a locally-robust feature selection (LRFS) method has been proposed to find generic feature subsets of the electroencephalography (EEG) within a group of accessible subjects. The LRFS first modeled EEG features by using different probability densities. By quantitatively measuring the similarity of the estimated density functions, inter-intersubject consistency of each EEG feature is represented.

98,Research on the methods to retrieve continuous spatial distribution of PM_(2.5/10) based on machine learning and satellite imagery,11,4,447-455,",","Zhang Meng,Zhang Bo",,,Zhang Meng,"Background,aim,and scope In the past decades,the rapid industrialization and urbanization have increased the environmental burden in China.PM_(2.5/10) (incl.PM_(2.5) and PM_(10)),which have significant impacts on human health,have become the primary pollutant affecting ambient air quality in most large cities in most large cities of North China.How to efficiently as well as accurately obtain the temporal and spatial distribution of PM_(2.5/10) concentration has become a popular research topic.Due to the uneven and sparse distribution of ground monitoring stations,it is difficult to get the accurate continuous distributions of PM_(2.5/10) concentration for one whole research area by the means of spatial interpolation and/or numerical simulation based on the discrete values from the ground monitoring stations.Taking advantages of high time effect,wide coverage,high load ability and robust characteristics,the retrieval of the PM_(2.5/10) concentrations based on the satellite imagery has become more and more valuable and popular.In the literatures published so far,the data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are often employed to retrieve the PM_(2.5/10) concentrations by implementing linear and/or nonlinear regression analysis methods.However,the processes to calculate the AOD necessitate some kinds of special parameters,which are hard to be calculated and could be distinct in different research areas,i.e.there is still a lack of generic and robust methods/models to retrieve the PM_(2.5/10) concentrations from the satellite images.Due to the ill-posed issues mentioned above,this article is dedicated to developing a generic model to obtain the continuous spatial distributions of the PM_(2.5/10) concentration from satellite imagery based on the method of Multilayer Back Propagation Neural-network.Materials and methods In this research,the platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been employed to acquire the large amount sample data of (1) Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing images with the spatial resolution of 30 m,(2) the spatial parameters such as latitude,longitude and altitude,(3) the meteorological parameters of barometric pressure,relative humidity,temperature,wind direction,wind speed,etc.,and(4) PM_(2.5/10) concentrations from ground monitoring stations.Hereinto,the data of (1),(2) and (3) can be treated as the input',while the data of (4) is the output'.In order to find the optimal combination of the input parameters for the best retrieval' performances,the alternative input' parameters have been categorized into different groups from two the aspects of influence factor' and retroactive time',which were stepwise employed by the proposed model for the neural-network training.Results Taking Beijing as the research area,the retrieval precisions,measured by R~2,have reached 0.814 and 0.796 for the PM_(2.5) and PM_(10) respectively.Simultaneously,the RMSE reached 19.21 mug · m~(-3) and 28.31 mug · m~(-3).The retrieval results of the proposed model have been compared with the results calculated by Kriging interpolation.Their general spatial distribution characteristics are consistent to each other  the higher PM_(2.5/10) concentrations occurred in the south,while the lower values are located in the north of Beijing,China.Discussion The retrieval accuracy of the proposed model is satisfactory and higher than many established models based on the AOD method.To make the validation analysis,the proposed model has been implemented to obtain the continuous spatial distribution graphs of the PM_(2.5/10) concentrations in Beijing,which are significantly better than that of Kriging interpolations in terms of resolution and clarity.Furthermore,as the Landsat 8 OLI are taken as the basis' for the retrievals,the distribution graphs of PM_(2.5/10) concentrations generated in this article have a much higher spatial resolution than many other works.","machine learning,; satellite imagery; PM_(2.5/10) retrieval; continuous spatial distribution",Article,,,,,,,,
99,Model based on SSA-XGBoost method for predicting precipitation change trends,11,5,475-485,",,,,,","Xu Lei,Wang Tianli,Liu Songguo,Li Dong,Li Wei,Tan Liangcheng",,,Xu Lei,"Background, aim, and scope Predicting future climate changes is one of the most important scientific questions in the research field of global change. Precise and reliable prediction results can enable us to plan ahead and minimize the impacts of drought and flood disasters on social and economic developments. However, the establishment of prediction models is both necessary and difficult to achieve. Furthermore, owing to the current unstable climate, the requirement for the accuracy of such models has increased. Hence, this study addresses the problems that conventional methods cannot effectively predict in long-term time series, which in turn can be significant for the prediction of periodic series. Materials and methods In this study, a model based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA)-XGBoost method was developed by incorporating the precipitation records over the past 270 years (AD 1773  2004) that were reconstructed on the basis of the stalagmite delta~(18)O content in southern Thailand. After detrending the original data, the oscillation components of the past data (AD 17731964) were extracted through SSA for determining the optimal harmonic number of the data and for reconstructing accurate periodic signal components. Subsequently, subtracting the periodic signal from the detrended original data produced a random signal, which was predicted by employing the XGBoost framework for obtaining a forecast sequence. The final forecast results (AD 19652004) were obtained by superimposing the obtained sequence and the periodic signal extension results. Results The obtained results indicate that the proposed model based on the SSA-XGBoost method performs very well while predicting the test date. The proposed model's mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values are found to be 0.1334 and 0.1678, respectively. Furthermore, the value of R-square (R2) is found to be 0.536. Discussion In general, the proposed model has revealed satisfactory performance for the predictions of precipitation. Apart from the machine learning frameworks, XGBoost and LightGBM, conventional models such as ARIMA and SSA-ARIMA were employed for predicting the data to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model. It is observed that each model provides unique features while predicting the final results. Conclusions Compared to the prediction results of the other four models (XGBoost, ARIMA, SSA-ARIMA, and LightGBM), the prediction result of the proposed model is closest to the real value. Both the MAE and RMSE of the SSA-XGBoost method are lowest in value, and the value of R~2 is closest to 1, which indicates that the proposed model based on the SSA-XGBoost method has relatively higher precision and stability. Recommendations and perspectives This study serves as an important directive for future studies on predicting precipitation changes in southern Thailand and other tropical regions, and it also provides a reference for future research on predicting long-term time series.","precipitation change trend; prediction; ,machine learning,; XGBoost Model; Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)",Article,,,,,,,,
