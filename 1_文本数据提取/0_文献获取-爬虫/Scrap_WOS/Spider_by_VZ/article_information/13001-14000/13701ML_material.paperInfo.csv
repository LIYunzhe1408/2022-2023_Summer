1,Deep Learning Based Recognition of Hand Movement Intention EEG in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury,,,343-348,"Jiang Yongyu,Zhang Xiaodong,Chen Chaoyang,Lu Zhufeng);,Yachun Yachun","Jiang YY,Zhang XD,Chen CY,Lu ZF,Yachun YC",Jiang YY,,Xi'an Jiaotong University,"In the field of medicine and rehabilitation, brain-controlled prosthetic hands can help patients with spinal cord injury to carry out daily activities. However, the recognition of EEG signals aiming at the hand movement intention of disabled patients has been faced with the difficulties of low accuracy, poor stability and weak robustness. Especially for unilateral hand movement control, the EEG intention of distinguishing different movements comes from unilateral cerebral cortex, and the degree of confusion is high. In this paper, deep learning method is introduced for EEG signal perception and recognition. A convolutional neural network model is proposed, combining with Common Spatial Patterns, to identify the intention of unilateral hand movement motion (palm extension, hand grasp). EEG signals from 15 healthy subjects and 10 patients with spinal cord injury were collected. Among the 15 healthy subjects, the average recognition accuracy was 91.57%, among which the optimal accuracy achieved 95.83%. In 10 patients with spinal cord injury, the average recognition accuracy was 78.03%, among which the optimal subjects' recognition accuracy was 82.41%. In addition, an off-line EEG recognition and control system was set up. The average accuracy of a subject was 87.92%, and the average system recognition and control time was 13.9ms. With excellent accuracy and recognition speed, this method has great value and application prospect in the fields of brain-computer interface, robotics and rehabilitation medicine for the disabled.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Robotics",,,,,,

Firstly, the mechanism of readiness potential (RP) was analyzed, its property is an important basis for movement intention detection. Then, the lower limb voluntary movement intention detection system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) was established and six healthy subjects participated in this experiment. The different CNN models were established as a classifier. The experimental results show that the window length of EEG classification data was set as 300ms to get a better detection accuracy and time performance.

On the one hand, the B-ultrasound diagnostic doctor fixed his eyes on the screen of B-ultrasound monitor, on the other hand, he operated the probe to move on the patient's position to be examined. With dozens of patients are examined every day, so B-mode ultrasound doctors often work at full-load every day and lead to eye fatigue. Eye fatigue easily causes erroneous diagnosis or missed diagnosis.

Standard methods for estimating joint torques are limited to laboratory or clinical settings since they require expensive equipment to measure joint kinematics and ground reaction forces. Wearable sensor data combined with neural networks may offer a less expensive and obtrusive estimation method. We present a method of mapping joint torque estimates obtained from motion capture and ground reaction forces to wearable sensor data. We use several different neural networks to learn the torque mapping for the ankle joints during standing, walking, running, and sprinting.
Our results show that neural networks that consider time (recurrent and long short-term memory networks) outperform feedforward network architectures, producing results in the range of 0.005-0.008 N.m/kg mean squared error (MSE) when compared to the inverse dynamics model on which it was trained. As a point of reference, the typical measurement errors from inverse dynamics models are in the range of 0.0004-0.0064 N.m/kg MSE. Errors tended to increase with locomotion speed, with the highest errors during sprinting and the lowest during standing or walking. Future work may investigate model generalizability across sensor placements, subjects, locomotion variants, and usage duration. The proposed method relies on learning from a motion capture dataset, but once the model is built, the method uses wearable sensors that enable torque estimation without the motion capture data.

To improve the information transfer rate (ITR), a spatial filter based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were also applied to this work to improve the performance of BCI classification. The result of experiments showed that the proposed BCI is with 88.2% in accuracy and 22.97 bits/min information transfer rate in average received from ten subjects. In ground truth experiments of practical trajectory tracking, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of P300 BCI are 12.11cm in ""U"" trajectory test.","Brain-machine interfaces,Human-machine interfaces",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Robotics",,,"BRAIN-COMPUTER,INTERFACE,P300,SYSTEM,EEG",,,

This is done by providing assistance that is in line with the user's movement during different locomotion modes (e.g., ramps and stairs). Several machine learning techniques have been applied to classify such tasks on lower limb prostheses, but these strategies have not been applied extensively to exoskeleton systems which often rely on similar control inputs. Additionally, conventional methods often identify modes at a discrete time during the gait cycle which can delay the corresponding assistance to the user and potentially reduce overall exoskeleton benefit. We developed a gait phase-based Bayesian classifier that can classify five ambulation modes continuously throughout the gait cycle using only mechanical sensors on the device. From our five able-bodied subject experiment with a robotic hip exoskeleton, we found that implementing multiple models within the gait cycle can reduce the classification error rate by 35% compared to using a single model (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that utilizing bilateral sensor information can reduce the error by 43% compared to using a unilateral information (p < 0.05). Our study findings provide valuable information for future exoskeleton developers to utilize different on-board mechanical sensors to enhance mode classification for a faster update rate in the controller and provide more natural and seamless exoskeleton assistance between locomotion modes.","Exoskeleton,Machine Learning,Locomotion Mode,Continuous Classification,Sensor Fusion",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Robotics",,,"OF-THE-ART,RECOGNITION,AMBULATION",,,

The framework consists of i) a deep convolutional neural network that extracts task-discriminative spatiotemporal EEG features to predict the level of CE for two classes-cognitively engaged vs. disengaged; and ii) a novel sliding window method that predicts continuous levels of CE in short time intervals. We evaluated our framework on 8 healthy subjects using an in-house Go/No-Go experiment that adapted its gameplay parameters to induce cognitive fatigue. The proposed CNN had an average leave-one-subjectout accuracy of 88.19%. The CE prediction correlated well with a commonly used behavioral metric based on self-reports taken every 5 minutes (rho =0.93).

Yet, it is commonly based on robot-derived movement kinematics, which is a rather subjective measurement of performance, especially in the presence of a sensorimotor impairment. Here, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measurement of two kinematics components that are typically used to assess motor learning and thereby adaptation: i) the intent to initiate a goal-directed movement, and ii) the reaction time (RT) for that movement. We evaluated our CNN on data acquired from an in-house experiment where 12 healthy subjects moved a rehabilitation robotic arm in four directions on a plane, in response to visual stimuli. Our CNN achieved average test accuracies of 80.08% and 79.82% in a binary classification of the intent (intent vs. no intent) and RT (slow vs. fast), respectively. Our results demonstrate how individual movement components implicated in distinct types of motor learning can be predicted from synchronized EEG data acquired before the start of the movement. Our approach can, therefore, inform robotic adaptation in real-time and has the potential to further improve one's ability to perform the rehabilitation task.","MOTOR,RECOVERY,PERFORMANCE,MODEL",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Robotics",,,"MOTOR,RECOVERY,PERFORMANCE,MODEL",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08354,

These limitations make the technology unsuitable for amputees with only proximal muscles, who need optimal prosthetic device control during everyday activities. Therefore, we developed a novel Machine Learning (ML)-driven NMS model able to predict lower limb joint torque only from wearable sensors than can be embedded in a prosthetic device. Methods: After the NMS model calibration of a single healthy subject (OpenSim (R) software and Calibrated EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Modelling CEINMS Toolbox), an additional ML layer (Gaussian Mixture Regressors) was added to the model to replace the MoCap-derived dependent variables with estimations obtained only from wearable sensors. An on-line open-loop Forward Dynamic (FD) simulation of the knee joint is computed and torque trajectories are compared to experimental ones. Results: Estimations of the novel ML-driven Musculoskeletal model were comparable with experimental knee joint torque during typical locomotion tasks. Accuracy results were comparable to standard EMG-driven MS models and errors are below the threshold of Normalized Root Mean Square Deviation <= 0.30 recognized in literature. Conclusions: We developed the first concept of completely wearable and subject-specific EMG-driven NMS model control for lower limb prostheses. The possibility to use this NMS model for FD simulations and the estimation of torque reference control avoids the use of current heuristic and overly complex standard controllers for lower limb prostheses.

Early autism diagnosis can ameliorate lifetime outcomes by enabling earlier access to treatment.

Machine learning is often applied to Surface Electromyography (sEMG) to control dexterous prosthetic hands. However, it can be affected by low robustness in real life conditions, mainly due to data variability depending on various factors (such as the position of the limb, of the electrodes or the characteristics of the subject).
This paper aims at improving the understanding of sEMG for prosthesis control introducing the type of hand movement as a variable that influences classification performance in both intact subjects and hand amputees.
Five hand amputees and five matched intact subjects were selected from the publicly available NinaPro database. The subjects were recorded while repeating 40 hand movements. Movement classification was performed on the sEMG data with a window-based approach (concatenating several signal features) and a Random Forest classifier. The results show that some hand movements are classified significantly better than others (p<0.001) and there is a correspondence in how well the same hand movements are classified in intact subjects and hand amputees.

Conventionally, surgeons while performing biopsies rely on ultrasound images and intuitive feeling about needle-tissue interaction forces to confirm target location. Currently, robotic assistance for biopsy uses only the position parameter to address localization challenges. In the present work, in addition to a robot's position sense, we propose to integrate needle-tissue force parameter. This force model presents a new way to built an intelligent robot that can identify tissue properties during needle probing/biopsy. Methods: A standard experiment was setup that consist of a force sensor, a linear stage, a biopsy needle, and synthetic tissues. During the experiment, needle penetrates through synthetic tissues, a set of data (force and distance) was acquired and manually labeled. A recurrent neural network (RNN) based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained with the data to estimate the various classes (air, skin/fibrous tissue, puncture, and hard tissue). Result: The trained model is able to distinguish between the three synthetic materials. Intuitively, this model mimics human perceptions of force during a handheld needle penetration. Conclusion: The constrained experimental setup helps us present a proof of concept for using deep learning models for tissue classification.

During the learning process, 3439 projections are selected as complete projection data, and the corresponding truncated data is simulated according to the actual truncation situation. Then, 150 of the truncated data are randomly selected as the test samples, while the rest 3289 of those as the training samples in the U-net. The output sinogram data is compared with the original complete data by calculating the L2 loss function of both. And the Adam optimizer is used to continuously optimize the parameters of the network. RMSE and NMAD are used to quantitatively evaluate the reconstruction effect. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on truncated data extrapolation network can obviously suppress the ring artifacts and compared with images directly reconstructed using truncated projection data, the RMSE is reduced by an average of 43.185%, and the NMAD is reduced by 44.24%.","CT,local reconstruction,U-net,data extrapolation,truncation",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Computer Science,Optics",,,"LOW-DOSE,CT",,,

Due to the non-stationary nature of the ECG signal, it is rather challenging to use traditional handcraft methods, such as time-based analysis of feature extraction and classification, to pave the way for machine learning implementation. This paper proposed a novel method, i.e., the ensemble of depthwise separable convolutional (DSC) neural networks for the classification of cardiac arrhythmia ECG beats. Using our proposed method, the four stages of ECG classification, i.e., QRS detection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, were reduced to two steps only, i.e., QRS detection and classification. No preprocessing method was required while feature extraction was combined with classification. Moreover, to reduce the computational cost while maintaining its accuracy, several techniques were implemented, including All Convolutional Network (ACN), Batch Normalization (BN), and ensemble convolutional neural networks. The performance of the proposed ensemble CNNs were evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrythmia database. In the training phase, around 22% of the 110,057 beats data extracted from 48 records were utilized. Using only these 22% labeled training data, our proposed algorithm was able to classify the remaining 78% of the database into 16 classes. Furthermore, the sensitivity (S-n), specificity (S-p), and positive predictivity (P-p), and accuracy (Acc) are 99.03%, 99.94%, 99.03%, and 99.88%, respectively. The proposed algorithm required around 180 mu s, which is suitable for real time application. These results showed that our proposed method outperformed other state of the art methods.","depthwise separable convolution (DSC),all convolutional network (ACN),batch normalization (BN),ensemble convolutional neural network (ECNN),electrocardiogram (ECG),MIT-BIH database",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION,ECG,WAVELET,SIGNALS",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/483/pdf,

NDs can initially start through embryonic development due to several reasons. Up to three in 1000 pregnant women have embryos with brain defects; hence, the primitive detection of embryonic neurodevelopmental disorders (ENDs) is necessary. Related work done for embryonic ND classification is very limited and is based on conventional machine learning (ML) methods for feature extraction and classification processes. Feature extraction of these methods is handcrafted and has several drawbacks. Deep learning methods have the ability to deduce an optimum demonstration from the raw images without image enhancement, segmentation, and feature extraction processes, leading to an effective classification process. This article proposes a new framework based on deep learning methods for the detection of END. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses deep learning techniques for detecting END. The framework consists of four stages which are transfer learning, deep feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. The framework depends on feature fusion. The results showed that the proposed framework was capable of identifying END from embryonic MRI images of various gestational ages. To verify the efficiency of the proposed framework, the results were compared with related work that used embryonic images. The performance of the proposed framework was competitive. This means that the proposed framework can be successively used for detecting END.","deep learning,convolution neural networks (CNNs),machine learning,embryonic neurodevelopment disorders,MRI imaging",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",General & Internal Medicine,,3.674,"CLASSIFICATION,FETAL,NETWORK,DISEASE",DIAGNOSTICS,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7169467?pdf=render,

They assumed each level to be describable by a Gaussian process, and used low-fidelity simulations to improve inference on costly high-fidelity simulations. Departing from there, we move away from the common non-Bayesian practice of optimization and marginalize the parameters instead. Thus, we avoid the awkward logical dilemma of having to choose parameters and of neglecting that choice's uncertainty. We propagate the parameter uncertainties by averaging the predictions and the prediction uncertainties over all the possible parameters. This is done analytically for all but the nonlinear or inseparable kernel function parameters. What is left is a low-dimensional and feasible numerical integral depending on the choice of kernels, thus allowing for a fully Bayesian treatment. By quantifying the uncertainties of the parameters themselves too, we show that ""learning"" or optimising those parameters has little meaning when data is little and, thus, justify all our mathematical efforts. The recent hype about machine learning has long spilled over to computational engineering but fails to acknowledge that machine learning is a big data problem and that, in computational engineering, we usually face a little data problem. We devise the fully Bayesian uncertainty quantification method in a notation following the tradition of E.T. Jaynes and find that generalization to an arbitrary number of levels of fidelity and parallelisation becomes rather easy. We scrutinize the method with mock data and demonstrate its advantages in its natural application where high-fidelity data is little but low-fidelity data is not. We then apply the method to quantify the uncertainties in finite element simulations of impedance cardiography of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a cardiovascular disease that frequently requires immediate surgical treatment and, thus, a fast diagnosis before. While traditional medical imaging techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance tomography, or echocardiography certainly do the job, Impedance cardiography too is a clinical standard tool and promises to allow earlier diagnoses as well as to detect patients that otherwise go under the radar for too long.","uncertainty quantification,multi fidelity,Gaussian processes,probability theory,Bayes,impedance cardiography,aortic dissection",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Physics,,2.587,"COMPUTER,CODE,COMPLEX,DESIGN",ENTROPY,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7516489,

Recently, deep learning techniques have had great success in EEG decoding because of their prominent ability to learn features from raw EEG signals automatically. However, the challenge that the deep learning method faces is that the shortage of labeled EEG signals and EEGs sampled from other subjects cannot be used directly to train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for a target subject. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel conditional domain adaptation neural network (CDAN) framework for MI EEG signal decoding. Specifically, in the CDAN, a densely connected ConvNet is firstly applied to obtain high-level discriminative features from raw EEG time series. Then, a novel conditional domain discriminator is introduced to work as an adversarial with the label classifier to learn commonly shared intra-subjects EEG features. As a result, the CDAN model trained with sufficient EEG signals from other subjects can be used to classify the signals from the target subject efficiently. Competitive experimental results on a public EEG dataset (High Gamma Dataset) against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in recognizing MI EEG signals, indicating its effectiveness in automatic perceptual decision decoding.","electroencephalogram (EEG),motor imagery (MI),domain adaptation,signal classification,convolutional neural network",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Physics,,2.587,,ENTROPY,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/1/96/pdf,

An additional analysis showed that there are four characteristic classes of cross-sectional profiles of hot rolled strips that have a significant effect on the shape of the strips during cold rolling, three of which negatively affect the flatness of the cold rolled strips. The cross-sectional profiles of hot-rolled strips with a concave middle part and (or) marginal thickenings lead to the appearance of edge waviness, peak-like cross-sectional profiles cause central warping. Therefore, the actual task is to determine the factual shape of cross-sectional profile. Sixth order polynomials were used to digitalize and parameterize hot-rolled profile. As a result, we developed analytic function of the transverse profile, which keeps important information about its near-edge areas and features in the middle part. To assign a specific cross-sectional profile of a hot-rolled strip to one of four characteristic classes of cross-sections, mathematical software was developed, called a classifier, and implemented with the programming environment R. To classify the profiles of the hot-rolled cross-section according to characteristic classes, a linear discriminant method was used as a machine learning method analysis.

In this paper, a novel method using variational mode decomposition (VMD) based features and C4.5 classifier for detection of ventricular arrhythmias is presented. The VMD model was used to decompose the electrocardiography (ECG) signals to extract useful informative features. The method was tested for ECG signals obtained from PhysioNet database.

The ranked features are subjected to support vector machine (SVM) and C4.5 classifier for classification of normal, VT and VF classes. The best detection was obtained with sensitivity of 97.97%, specificity of 99.15%, and accuracy of 99.18% for C4.5 classifier with a 5 s data analysis window.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important basis for diagnosing heart diseases. In this paper, we propose a model to predict 55 classes of heart diseases simultaneously, that is, to solve a multi-label classification task. In order to make full use of the characteristics of the ECG, we propose a network structure combining residual neural network (ResNet) and gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU). On this basis, in order to solve the problem of imbalanced data set, the loss function is a improved focal loss. The results of experiments show the effectiveness of our method. More specifically, the method improves F1 score, while the hamming loss is reduced.

To mitigate this negative impact, the semi-supervised method is introduced to correct the mislabeled samples. The proposed method is based on the basic principle that the characteristics of samples of the same category are more similar than those of samples of different categories, so in the feature space,the number of samples of the same category around a sample is more than that of different categories. Cross validation is used to divide the training set into sub training set and validation set, and the samples in the validation set are regarded as unlabeled, k nearest neighbour(KNN) classifier label the samples in the validation set according to the samples in the sub training set. Because there are mislabeled samples in the sub training set, it is difficult for KNN classifier to label all samples in the validation set correctly at one time. So we need to use the above method iteratively. Thus, the mislabeled samples in the training set is basically corrected. Experients on the ECG signal corrected from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show the eectiveness of the proposed method.","ECG signals,Mislabeled samples,semi-supervised cluster,KNN",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science",,,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,CLASSIFICATION,FEATURES",PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE 9TH DATA DRIVEN CONTROL AND LEARNING SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (DDCLS'20),,

Among these approaches, the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) carries the potential of dealing with nonlinear and non-Gaussian industry problems, which has drawn increasing popularity and attentions in recent years. However, the fluctuation of raw materials, change of process environment, aging of instruments and other factors will have an effect on system performances over time. Hence, the lack of adaptive mechanism will make the GMR difficult to suit for time-varying processes and may cause large prediction errors. In order to model time-varying industrial processes and improve the adaptability of the conventional GMR, an adaptive soft sensor based on incremental Gaussian mixture regression (IGMR) is proposed in this paper. The incremental idea is integrated and an adaptive mechanism is added, which endow the proposed IGMR with the capability of adapting to new data in online environment.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printing is a microadditive manufacturing process in which high-resolution jets of polarizable functional materials were deposited on the defined spot of a substrate at the appointed time. The quality of the printed features is derived by the complex physics of the system. Parameter modeling of this process was carried out by using regression analysis, a feed-forward neural network trained with backpropagation (BPNN) and a neural network trained with a genetic algorithm (GA-NN) separately. This study emphasizes the droplet diameter prediction of an EHD inkjet printing system and explores the applicability of the soft computing-based methods for this new emerging technology. Soft computing-based approaches have been developed for the first time in this area to model the EHD inkjet process. Five hundred data were produced through the conventional regression analysis to train the neural network-based models. Output droplet diameter was predicted for different combinations of input parameters such as standoff height (SH), applied voltage (AV) and ink flow rate (FR) using the above three approaches, and their performances were analyzed through some randomly created real experimental test cases.

They consist of conscious mental reactions towards objects or situations and are associated with various physiological, behavioral, and cognitive changes. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis between different machine learning and deep learning techniques, with and without feature selection, for binarily classifying the six basic emotions, namely anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, into two symmetrical categorical classes (emotion and no emotion), using the physiological recordings and subjective ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance from the DEAP (Dataset for Emotion Analysis using EEG, Physiological and Video Signals) database. The results showed that the maximum classification accuracies for each emotion were: anger: 98.02%, joy:100%, surprise: 96%, disgust: 95%, fear: 90.75%, and sadness: 90.08%. In the case of four emotions (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness), the classification accuracies were higher without feature selection. Our approach to emotion classification has future applicability in the field of affective computing, which includes all the methods used for the automatic assessment of emotions and their applications in healthcare, education, marketing, website personalization, recommender systems, video games, and social media.","emotion classification,machine learning,feature selection,affective computing,biophysical sensors",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,2.612,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,RECOGNITION,METAANALYSIS,FRAMEWORK,INSULA,MODEL",SYMMETRY-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/1/21/pdf,

N.","Fu SY,Tseng YC,Chiang KN",Chiang KN,,National Tsing Hua University,"In the field of electronic packaging, the main trend is toward lighter, smaller and more functional. In the evolution of packaging technology, from PTH(Pin Through Hole), SMT(Surface Mount Technology), BGA (Ball Grid Array) to higher density and smaller package like Flip Chip (FC) and Wafer Level Packaging (WLP).
One of the important issues in the package structure is reliability. There are many factors that affect its reliability. For example, package structure size, material properties, process technology, etc. are all influencing factors. In the process of designing products, the experimental method is usually used, such as the Thermal Cycling Test, to test whether the designed product can pass the fatigue life standard, and in this way ensures that the designed product will not fail during the service period. However, in practice, if the reliability test is executed by experiment method, the cost and time spent will be quite high, resulting in delayed product launch time and rising development costs, even further caused a significant reduction in the competitiveness of enterprises.
In order to improve the above shortcomings, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been widely used in reliability assessment. Only a small amount of experimental data is needed to verified the simulation then we can greatly reduce the time spent and cost for evaluating product reliability. In this study, ANSYS software was used to simulate the equivalent plastic strain increment in Wafer-Level Package under Accelerated thermal cycling load. The Coffin-Manson formula based on strain and fixed mesh size were used to predict the fatigue life of the solder ball. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the simulation results to verify the simulation analysis and its credibility.
Although using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has reduced a lot of time spent and cost compared to Design on Experiment (DOE). The simulation results obtained by different researchers are not totally same. The purpose of this study is to apply Machine Learning (ML) to assess the reliability of electronic package structure. It can not only reduce the time spent for predicting the reliability prediction of different structures, but also eliminate the variance of the results simulated by different researchers. In this study, combined with finite element analysis and machine learning, a database built by verified simulation results, and the estimation model was trained through this database, making the reliability life prediction process more efficient.
In the choice of machine learning model, this study chose to use the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and compare it with the basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The effects of different training data sizes and distributions on the performance of the regression model are also discussed.","Wafer Level Package,Finite Element Analysis,Thermal Cycling Test,Reliability Assessment,Machine Learning,Artificial Neural Network,Recurrent Neural Network",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,,,,,

Next, multiple image processing operations were performed for segmenting and refining the bounding boxes corresponding to the teeth detections. Finally, each tooth instance was labeled and the problem affecting it was identified using a histogram-based majority voting within the detected region of interest.

88,An Artificial Neuron Network Based Chip Health Assessment Framework for IC Recycling,,,,Chen Yu-Guang,Chen YG,Chen YG,,National Central University,"In the past decade smart devices have become a major driving force behind the growth of semiconductor industry. The fierce competition for market shares and profits has rendered frequent release of new generations with fancier designs, more functionalities and better performance. On the other hand, the chips inside these smart devices are designed with lifetime typically spanning a few generations at least. As a result, many smart devices are thrown away with their chips still functioning. Conventional recycling business simply aims at recovering copper, silver, gold, palladium and other materials, and does not take into consideration the potentially functioning chips. We argue that a much better recycling framework should properly classify and bin the functioning chips from recycled smart devices for reuse so that additional profit can be generated and environment can be better protected. In this paper, we propose the concept of integrated circuit recycling, and demonstrate a statistical health assessment method using artificial neuron network (ANN) based search tree along with an optimal price-binning framework with low-cost measurements. Experimental results show that with the simple measurement of I-ddq, and V-min, our health assessment can eliminate lifetime overestimation, while flat ANN has that up to 13%.

We utilize a discriminator network as a trainable feature extractor which penalizes the discrepancy between the translated medical images and the desired modalities. Moreover, style-transfer losses are utilized to match the textures and fine-structures of the desired target images to the translated images. Additionally, we present a new generator architecture, titled CasNet, which enhances the sharpness of the translated medical outputs through progressive refinement via encoder-decoder pairs. Without any application-specific modifications, we apply MedGAN on three different tasks: PET-CT translation, correction of MR motion artefacts and PET image denoising. Perceptual analysis by radiologists and quantitative evaluations illustrate that the MedGAN outperforms other existing translation approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

99,Automated detection of focal cortical dysplasia using a deep convolutional neural network,79,,,"Wang Huiquan,Ahmed S. Nizam,Mandal Mrinal","Wang HQ,Ahmed SN,Mandal M",Mandal M,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.101662,University of Alberta,"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one of the commonest epileptogenic lesions, and is related to malformations of the cortical development. The findings on magnetic resonance (MR) images are important for the diagnosis and surgical planning of FCD. In this paper, an automated detection technique for FCD is proposed using MR images and deep learning. The input MR image is first preprocessed to correct the bias field, normalize intensities, align with a standard atlas, and strip the non-brain tissues. All cortical patches are then extracted on each axial slice, and these patches are classified into FCD and non-FCD using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with five convolutional layers, a max pooling layer, and two fully-connected layers. Finally, the false and missed classifications are corrected in the post-processing stage. The technique is evaluated using images of 10 patients with FCD and 20 controls. The proposed CNN shows a superior performance in classifying cortical image patches compared with multiple CNN architectures. For the system-level evaluation, nine of the ten FCD images are successfully detected, and 85% of the non-FCD images are correctly identified. Overall, this CNN based technique could learn optimal cortical (texture and symmetric) features automatically, and improve the FCD detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

LUDB contains 200 recordings of 10-second 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) from different subjects, representative of a variety of signal morfologies. The boundaries and peaks of QRS complexes and P and T waves are manually annotated by cardiologists for all recordings and independently for each lead, and all records received an expert classification by abnormalities. We present a case study for the recently proposed wavelet-based algorithm and the broadly used ecg-kit tool, and demonstrate the advantage of multi-lead ECG data analysis.
