Blood glucose monitoring (BGM) data from Novo Nordisk clinical trials was used to assess the prediction performances of 1, 4, 7, and 9-point profiles (PP) in comparison to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. The results showed that BGM data predictions can perform equivalently to CGM data, most consistently when using a 9-point profile, and competitively at the 7PP. However, a 9PP is not the most viable option, since it would require patients to prick their fingers 8 times per day. Further analysis of the deficiencies in lower point profiles such as 5PP and 6PP is required in order to understand optimal finger prick timings.","blood glucose monitoring,continuous glucose monitoring,point profiles,machine learning,prediction performance,patient experience",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,,,

We engineered a new technology allowing us to efficiently and rapidly capture bacterial cells from different biological samples and proceed with a rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing thereby bypassing the need to culture the bacterium. We developed a new machine learning and microscopy-based approach for rapid assessment of bacterial viability following tests with antibiotics. Also, we created a labeled dataset with similar to 100 images of live and dead bacteria stained with DAPI (DNA; blue) and FM4-64 (membrane; red) either treated with an antibiotic or untreated. We analyzed wild type (WT) and ampicillin-resistant (ampR) E. coli, WT and ampR S. aureus, and B. subtilis. For antibiotic susceptibility testing we used ampicillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. We extracted information about red and blue channels from the images and tried two machine learning classifiers for rapid assessment of viability of the bacteria.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the representative of the vast majority of traumatic brain injury. However, most studies have focused on moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. According to reports, mTBI patients during the acute period have the most prominent cognitive disorders. Hence, we collected the functional magnetic resonance imaging data in resting-state (rsfMRI) of the acute-mTBI patients and the healthy controls to explore the differences of brain functional connectivity between them. We chose dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state as features and performed feature selection/extraction. Finally, the classifier based on machine learning methods achieved a good classification accuracy of 85.48%.

There is an increasing number of researchers beginning to use deep learning to process electroencephalographic(EEG) brain signals. However, at the same time, due to the complexity of the experimental device and the expensive collection cost, we cannot train a powerful deep learning model without enough satisfactory EEG data. Data augmentation has been considered as an effective method to eliminate this issue. We propose the Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP) to synthesize EEG data for data augmentation. We use two public neural networks for a motor imagery task and combine the synthesized data with real EEG data to test the generated samples' data enhancement effect. The results indicate that our model can generate high-quality artificial EEG data, which can effectively learn the features from the original EEG data. Both neural networks have gained improved classification performance, and the more complex one has obtained more significant performance improvement.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to distinguish patients with congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation from normal sinus rhythm utilizing features calculated by time and frequency domains as well as nonlinear analysis.

Due to the complex network topology, for an individual brain, mining a discriminative network representation from the multimodal brain networks is non-trivial. The recent success of deep learning techniques on graph-structured data suggests a new way to model the non-linear cross-modality relationship. However, current deep brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or require a network basis shared within a group. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end deep graph representation learning (Deep Multimodal Brain Networks - DMBN) to fuse multimodal brain networks. Specifically, we decipher the cross-modality relationship through a graph encoding and decoding process. The higher-order network mappings from brain structural networks to functional networks are learned in the node domain. The learned network representation is a set of node features that are informative to induce brain saliency maps in a supervised manner. We test our framework in both synthetic and real image data.

The multi-step and single step machine learning approaches were analyzed to find the wavebands that provide the most information that helps discriminate skin melanoma from other benign pigmented lesions. The multi-step machine learning approach assumed training several models but proved itself to be ineffective. The reason for that is a necessity to train a segmentation model on a very small dataset and utilization of standard machine learning classifier which have shown poor classification performance. The single-step approach is based on a deep learning neural network. We have conducted 2600 experiments on two neural network architectures: popular pre-trained image analysis ""InceptionV3"" and simple custom convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifiers. Observing performance metrics of these two deep-learning (DL) based architectures allowed to determine combinations of three spectral wavebands allowing to train a classifier with the best classification results. It was found that a simple ConvNet classifier allowed us to get better classification results. ConvNet training results have shown that most informative wavebands are 450nm which is the most informative for melanin concentration on the skin surface, 590nm that represents integral information about melanin and hemoglobin distribution from epidermis-dermis layer, and 950 nm that provide information from deeper skin layers. As introduced the convolutional neural network (CNN) model was simple but has not shown great performance. Also, we have to explore alternative CNN architectures.

Cobots work alongside humans to extend the scope of robot assistance to spaces such as service and dynamic industrial or assembly tasks. With that said, the close proximity of humans with machines necessitates safe interaction, which can be achieved via lightweight materials and novel sensing capabilities. The inherent physical strength needed in some robot tasks, such as in assembly, make contact sensing of particular concern when introducing a human collaborator. A minimally intrusive method that can be seamlessly subsumed into extant devices is desired. In this paper, such a contact sensor is prototyped and tested. The sensor is bidirectional in that it actively provides an oscillatory actuation signal to a rigid link while simultaneously recording and analyzing the mechanical vibration of said link. Natural oscillation frequency shifts and energy concentration changes due to damping are congruent with different types of contact with the rigid link. The method is lightweight, low-cost and can be quickly incorporated into various manipulators. The developed configuration is advantageous as it does not require any delicate sensors on the robot body and relies primarily on actuated oscillations of the manipulator. Oscillatory acceleration data is collected and subsequently used to train and classify different contact locations using frequency-based features. Three separate classes are distinguished according to contact location.

Recently, we proposed a deep-learning-based method PIRNet which much decreases the deployment density of PIR-based DFL methods in multi-person scenarios. However, since PIRNet utilizes an end-to-end neural network that receives all the deployed PIR sensors' signals as input for localization, it has a defect of deployment-dependence: it assumes the PIR sensors' deployment in the testing environment is same to the training environment. Otherwise, it requires to be retrained. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a deployment-independent method DeepPIRATES, which can be applied in environments of any deployments without retraining. DeepPIRATES has the character of deployment-independence because it divides the localization task into two steps and only utilizes deep learning in the first step. Especially, the first step aims at estimating the information about the persons' relative locations to a PIR sensor. Therefore, the utilized neural network only needs to receive a single PIR sensor's signal as input and is independent to the sensors' deployment. In the second step, DeepPIRATES further infers the persons' absolute locations by a particle filter which fuses the predicted information about the persons' relative locations to each sensor and does not require training data. Through DeepPIRATES, we achieve average localization errors of 0.55m, 0.73m, and 0.88m in scenarios of 1-person, 2-persons, and 3-persons with a deployment density of 0.08 sensors/m(2).","device-free localization,PIR sensor network,deep learning",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering,Robotics",,,"TRACKING,SYSTEM","2020 IEEE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHATRONICS, ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICMRA 2020)",,

With the application of supercontinuum laser source, it is now possible to develop an HSL system, which can collect spectral and spatial information of targets simultaneously. Meanwhile, eye-safety and miniature HSL device with multiple spectral bands are given more priorities in on-site applications. In this paper, we tempt to investigate how to select spectral bands with a selection method. The proposed method consists of three steps: first, the variances among the classes based on hyperspectral feature parameters, termed inter-class variances, are calculated; second, the channels are sorted based on corresponding variances in descending order, and those with the two highest values are adopted as the initial input of classification; finally, the channels are selected successively from the rest of the sorted sequence until the classification accuracy reaches 100%. To test the performance of the proposed method, we collect 91/71-channel hyperspectral measurements of four different categories of materials with 5 nm spectral resolution using an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) based HSL. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve higher classification accuracy than a random band selection method with different classifiers (naive Bayes (NB) and support vector machine (SVM)) regardless of classification feature parameters (echo maximum and reflectance). To reach 100% accuracy, it demands 8-9 channels on average by echo maximum and 4-5 channels on average by reflectance based on NB classifier; these figures are 3-4 by echo maximum and 2-3 by reflectance with SVM classifier. The proposed method can complete classification task much faster than the random selection method. We further confirm the specific channels for the classification of different materials, and find that the optimal channels vary with different materials. The experimental results prove that the optimal band selection of HSL system for classification is reliable.","hyperspectral LiDAR,band selection,classification,inter-class variance",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,2.408,"CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEM,FEASIBILITY,INTENSITY,FOREST",ELECTRONICS,http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/bitstream/10397/82144/1/Shao_investigation_spectral_band.pdf,

Temperature and vessel filling degree at failure have been considered as input parameters (plus vessel volume), and the BLEVE blast energy has been estimated as output data by the ANN model. A Bayesian Regularization algorithm was chosen as the three-layer backpropagation training algorithm. Based on the neurons optimization process, the number of neurons at the hidden layer was five in the case of propane and four in the case of butane. The transfer function applied in this layer was a sigmoid, because it had an easy and straightforward differentiation for using in the backpropagation algorithm. For the output layer, the number of neurons had to be one in both cases, and the transfer function was purelin (linear). The model performance has been compared with experimental values, proving that the mechanical energy of a BLEVE explosion can be adequately predicted with the Artificial Neural Network approach.","BLEVE,Vessel explosion,Explosion energy,Blast overpressure,Pressure wave,Artificial neural network",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Engineering,,3.723,"BLAST,WAVE,OVERPRESSURE",JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES,,

The current study focuses on leveraging geometric features to realize an automatic and reliable landmarking. The existing implementations usually rely on classical geometric features and data-driven learning methods. However, such designs often have limitations to specific shape types. Additionally, calculating the features as a standalone step increases the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a convolutional Bayesian model for anatomical landmarking on multi-dimensional shapes. The main idea is to embed the convolutional filtering in a stationary kernel so that the geometric features are efficiently captured and implicitly encoded into the prior knowledge of a Gaussian process. In this way, the posterior inference is geometrically meaningful without entangling with extra features. By using a Gaussian process regression framework and the active learning strategy, our method is flexible and efficient in extracting arbitrary numbers of landmarks. We demonstrate extensive applications on various publicly available datasets, including one brain imaging cohort and three skeletal anatomy datasets. Both the visual and numerical evaluations verify the effectiveness of our method in extracting significant landmarks.",Anatomical landmarking; Gaussian process kernels,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

To further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the materials selection criteria must be focused on achieving high open-circuit voltage (V-oc) through the alignment of the energy levels of the ternary blends. Hence, machine-learning approaches are in high demand for extracting the complex correlation between V-oc and the energy levels of the ternary blends, which are crucial to facilitate device design. Herein, the data-driven strategies are used to generate a model based on the available experimental data, and the V-oc is then predicted using available machine-learning methods (the Random Forest regression and the Support Vector regression). In addition, the Random Forest regression is developed to find the appropriate energy-level alignment of ternary OSCs and to reveal the relationship between V-oc and electronic features. Finally, an analysis based on the ranking of variables in terms of importance by the Random Forest model is performed to identify the key feature governing the V-oc and the performance of ternary OSCs. From the perspective of device design, the machine-learning approach provides sufficient insights to improve the V-oc and advances the comprehensive understanding of ternary OSCs.","ternary organic solar cells,machine-learning,open-circuit voltage",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Robotics",,,"HIGH-PERFORMANCE,3RD,COMPONENTS,EFFICIENT,FULLERENES",ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/aisy.201900108,

In order to understand the causes of this disease, public-private partnerships such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) release data into the scientific community. These data are organized into various modalities (genetic, brain-imaging, cognitive scores, diagnoses, etc.) for analysis. Many statistical learning approaches used in medical image analysis do not explicitly take advantage of this multimodal data structure. In this work we propose a novel objective function and optimization algorithm that is designed to handle multimodal information for the prediction and analysis of AD. Our approach relies on robust matrix-factorization and row-wise sparsity provided by the l(2,1)-norm in order to integrate multimodal data provided by the ADNI. These techniques are jointly optimized with a classification task to guide the feature selection in our proposed Task Balanced Multimodal Feature Selection method. Our results, when compared against some widely used machine learning algorithms, show improved balanced accuracies, precision, and Matthew's correlation coefficients for identifying cognitive decline. In addition to the improved prediction performance, our method is able to identify brain and genetic biomarkers that are of interest to the clinical research community. Our experiments validate existing brain biomarkers and single nucleotide polymorphisms located on chromosome 11 and detail novel polymorphisms on chromosome 10 that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not previously been reported.

The early signs of AMD are drusen, which appear as yellowish deposits under the retina. The end-stages of AMD include two forms: wet AMD (neovascular) and geographic atrophy (GA, non-neovascular). We propose a deep learning approach using a pre-trained VGG-19 neural network to classify the optical coherence tomography (OCT) images into wet AMD, GA, drusen, and healthy images. To explain the results, we quantify and present the prediction confidence and reliability as well as the regions of interest deemed to be important by the deep learning model when classifying OCT images. The sensitivity of classification for wet AMD, GA, drusen, and healthy images was 91.67%, 88.00%, 96.30% and 100% respectively, with the most confident predictions being for the drusen and healthy images. Visual inspection of the misclassified images using heatmaps using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm revealed that, for most of the misclassified images that had high prediction confidence, the algorithm identified correctly more than one region of interest, each belonging to a different AMD category. We concluded that, rather than assigning just one label to an AMD image, algorithms for AMD classification should allow multi-labels as images generally show evidence of more than one stage of AMD simultaneously (e.g., drusen as the predominant region and GA as a small region of interest).","Age-related macular degeneration,Image Classification,Transfer Learning,Grad-CAM",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,,"DIABETIC,MACULAR,EDEMA",,,

The purpose of the current study is to predict in-hospital and after-discharge mortality in patients with VTE admitted to ICU using a machine learning (ML) framework.

Feature-constrained model fitting is one way to obtain patient-specific models from a statistical model. This approach requires an accurate selection of corresponding features, usually landmarks, from the bi-planar X-ray images. However, super-positioned structures in 2D X-ray images confound this approach. This paper reports on the use of a deep learning algorithm to detect the contour of the scapula in synthetic bi-planar X-ray images to address this limitation. Two independent U-net models were trained to learn the mapping between synthetic bi-planar X-ray images of the scapula. The first model was trained to learn the mapping of the scapula contour in the lateral image view given the anterior-posterior image view and the second to learn the mapping of the scapula contour in the anterior-posterior image view given the lateral image view. The predicted images, when compared to the ground-truth, gave Dice coefficient values of 0.93 and 0.96 for the first and second models, respectively. These results are comparable to those in literature.

Furthermore, subsequent cluster analysis on the new feature set learned from DGCCA is able to identify a promising population structure in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort.

Over the last years, ultrasound (US) imaging has become a promising modality for image guidance due to its ability to provide volumetric images of soft tissue in real-time without using ionizing radiation. One key challenge in automatic US image analysis is the identification of suitable features to describe the image or regions within, e.g. for recognition, alignment or tracking tasks. In recent years, features that were learned data-drivenly provided promising results. Even though these approaches outperformed hand-crafted feature extractors in many applications, there is still a lack of feature learning for local description of three-dimensional US (3DUS) images. In this work, we present a completely data-driven feature learning approach for 3DUS images for usage in target tracking. To this end, we use a 3D convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a custom loss function to encode 3DUS image patches into a compact latent space that serves as a general feature description. For evaluation, we trained and tested the proposed architecture on 3DUS images of the liver and prostate of five different subjects and assessed the similarity between the decoded patches and the original ones. Subject- and organ-specific as well as general AEs are trained and evaluated. Specific AEs could reconstruct patches with a mean Normalized Cross Correlation of 0.85 and 0.81 at maximum in liver and prostate, respectively. It can also be shown that the AEs are transferable across subjects and organs, with a small accuracy decrease to 0.83 and 0.81 (liver, prostate) for general AEs. In addition, a first tracking study was performed to show feasibility of tracking in latent space. In this work, we could show that it is possible to train an AE that is transferable across two target regions and several subjects.

Specifically, focal spikes in patient-specific channels as well as other patient specific patterns can strongly indicate seizure activity. Manual diagnosis on these markers leads to inconsistent interrater agreement and poor detection accuracy. Previous automation attempts have ignored patient specific approaches but fail to generalize to previously unseen patients. To reduce subjectivity in manual diagnosis, we propose an automatic seizure detection pipeline that includes quality control, preprocessing, and meta transfer learning for both feature extraction and classification. To mitigate the inter-patient seizure pattern variation, we adapt Meta UPdate Strategy (MUPS) for four-class classification on the world's largest public seizure dataset of EEGs, Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ). Different from existing works on binary seizure detection, we use the non-seizure samples and the top three most frequent seizure types for seizure detection. Our experiments show that the meta transfer learning approach achieves macro-F1 of 0.5103 and AUC of 0.6792, which outperforms the baseline learners (shallow and deep) by mitigating patient-topatient variations.

However, the primary challenge involved in such segmentation approaches is the availability of applicable training data. Since only experts are equipped to effectively annotate (or label) any available data for training semantic segmentation networks, the effort and cost involved can be considerable, especially for larger datasets. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by proposing a Thrifty Annotation Generation approach that records high performance on segmentation networks with minimal expert effort and cost (intervention). We present a deep active learning framework that combines the use of marker-controlled watershed (MC-WS) algorithm to generate pseudo labels for segmentation networks (U-Net) and active learning to significantly minimize effort and cost by selecting only the most impactful training data for labeling. We built the initial U-Net model by generating pseudo labels for the training data using MC-WS. We then make use of the uncertainty information (entropy) of each image provided by the U-Net to determine the most uncertain or effective images for expert labeling. We evaluated the TAG approach using the 2012 ISBI Challenge dataset for 2D segmentation and a novel Biofilm dataset. Our approach achieved promising segmentation accuracy (IoU) and classification accuracy with minimal expert intervention.

However, these findings fail utilization in real-world clinical settings. The intention of this work is to demonstrate the ability to provide widespread access to medical imaging through computer-assisted technology across various community care providers, thus allowing meaningful use outcomes to population and public health. We have created an end-to-end fully automated approach to mental health screening leveraged by artificial intelligence. This workflow involves four core solutions: a voice-activated user interaction, rapid 3D T1-weighted contrast and a resting-state functional acquisition, deep learning-based image analysis, and 3D interactive visualization. Intelligent protocolling is used to obtain optimal pulse sequence parameters to satisfy any time constraint. Rigid registration, k-means tissue classification, and an augmented artificial neural network trained on a public database and Talairach atlas segments out over 60 brain structures with corresponding quantitative measures. Functional MR images are processed via seed-based connectivity to produce functional connectivity maps. Finally, a simplistic user experience implementing text-to-speech, speech-to-text technology coupled with a medical image viewer gives interactive passage to medical imaging results. While various tools have emerged to examine both structural and functional MRI within the research space, a simple straightforward, voice-activated interface to perform the scan, automatically process and retrieve meaningful results, that can be accomplished in less than 20 minutes, enables non-specialists to comprehend all relevant information.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast, simple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring electrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often need to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on improving patient care and outcomes.
Because of this, automatic ECG classification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can learn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect abnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to generalize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which drop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine learning algorithms suffer a 'black-box' issue, in which it is difficult to determine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in healthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation in order to trust the algorithm.
This paper proposes a method for visualizing model decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using adapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what patterns are being learned. We do this by building two algorithms based on state-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to find problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model performance.

This study demonstrates a classification of different types of stress during Maastricht Acute Stress Test by using feature combinations from electro-oculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in general and personalized approaches, comparing three different classifiers. The classification is evaluated for features extracted from both signals separately and together, and the most important features are selected and reported. Results indicate that the best performance is achieved when features from both EOG and ECG signals are used, and approximately twenty features from EOG and ECG signals are enough to distinguish the two/three states. A personalized approach together with feature selection and support vector machine classifier achieves accuracies of 96.9% and 86.3% in classifying between two states (relaxation and stress) and three states (relaxation, psycho-social stress, and physiological stress), respectively, which exceed state-of-the-art performance.

Not only it is a multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing different symptoms (retention, dysuria, haematuria, etc.), but also a multifactorial problem, as it depends on both patient-specific clinical factors, individual biological parameters, and dosimetric patterns. Thus, there are a plethora of potential predictors compared to the paucity of available symptom-specific toxicity data. On top of that, in elder patients, urinary complications are not necessarily treatment-related which introduces important noise to the urinary toxicity assessment. In recent years, a growing interest in machine learning (ML) appears within the radiotherapy community. The goal of ML algorithms is to learn from existing data to recognize patterns in the population and make informed decisions. The purpose of this study was to implement two advanced heterogeneous ensemble methods, namely Stacking and Genetic Algorithm-based Weighted Average Voting for improving urinary toxicity prediction in the case of prostate cancer radiotherapy. Our analysis demonstrated that both GA-based Voting (AUC=0.66) and Stacking (AUC=0.80) outperformed the standard Weighted Voting classifier (AUC=0.66).

In this electro-physiological technique, the EIM parameters, namely resistance, reactance, and phase magnitude, depend on several anatomic factors such as muscle girth, skin thickness, fat thickness. EIM may also be affected by several non-anatomic factors like frequency, electrode size, and inter-electrode distance. This paper explores the female breast tumor type classification by extracting EIM parameters from a 3D model of the female breast. The extracted EIM parameters from the simulation employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to identify benign and malignant tumor types. A 3D finite element (FEM) model of a female breast with a rectangular shape of electrodes are developed with a base shape of an 80 mm outer radius. The subsequent shapes are designed as -20% and +20% of the base shape, as mentioned above. This paper presents the EIM parameters that can classify female breast tumor types with an accuracy of 96.2% using an ANN.","Artificial neural network,ANN,Benign tumor,Female breast cancer,Breast tumor,Electrical impedance myography,EIM,Finite element method,FEM,Machine learning,ML,Malignant tumor,Tumor type classification,Tumor location prediction",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,,MUSCLE,,,

In mammography, the most reliable screening tool for its diagnosis, expert radiologists review the mammograms to determine whether the patient has any signs of disease. Unfortunately, the evaluation of breast abnormalities is challenging, even for experienced radiologists. Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems can assist in the detection of breast cancer. In this work, an algorithm for the automatic detection and classification of masses, based on subtraction of sequential digital mammograms, image registration and machine learning, is presented. Previous studies assessed the use of sequential mammograms to perform temporal analysis by creating a new temporal feature vector. Temporal subtraction registers and subtracts the prior mammogram from the current one, prior to performing mass detection and classification. A new dataset, which includes sequential pairs from 40 patients (160 mammograms) with precisely annotated mass locations (benign and suspicious), was created to assess the performance of the algorithm. For the classification, various features were extracted and six classifiers were used in a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. The accuracy of the classification of masses as benign or suspicious increased from 90.83% (with the previously described temporal analysis) to 96.51% (with temporal subtraction). The improvement was statistically significant with p < 0.05. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique of temporal subtraction of mammograms for the detection of masses.","Breast cancer,computer-aided diagnosis,digital mammography,breast mass,temporal subtraction",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4396017/files/BIBE2020_Final_Version.pdf,

To diagnose it, pathologists evaluate breast histopathology images under a microscope in various magnifications. However, the number of pathologists per population is low in many countries, and a mistake is probable. Nowadays, deep learning has become a popular artificial intelligence research trends. Even though deep neural networks have obtained promising results in image processing, the need for extensive training data avoids its use in medical image processing. After the evaluation of various state-of-the-art deep learning methods and algorithms in medical data processing, this study proposes an effective deep transfer learning-based model, relying on pre-trained DCNN using an extensive data of ImageNet dataset which improves state-of-the-art systems in both binary and multi-class classification. The weights of the pre-trained DesneNet121 on the Imagenet are transferred as initial weights first, and then the model is fine-tuned with a deep classifier along with data augmentation to distinguish various malignant and benign samples in the two categories of binary and multi-class classification. In the multi-class classification, the proposed model obtained up to 97% image-level accuracy. In binary classification, the model obtained up to 100% image-level accuracy. The achieved-results are outperforming previous studies accuracies in multiple performance metrics in breast cancer CAD systems. Moreover, the proposed method is both flexible and scalable, meaning it can be easily expanded to cover the detection of other types of diseases in the future and be integrated with more CNNs to increase its generalization capabilities.","Breast cancer,CNN,DensNet,BreakHis dataset,Medical image classification,Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,,CLASSIFICATION,,,

The most common type, being Osteoarthritis, is due to the cartilage in a joint wearing away over time which leaves the bones to rub against each other causing pain and discomfort. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 50 million adults have been diagnosed with Arthritis in the United States of America which is 1 in 5 adults. This equates to a financial cost of $304 Billion in 2013 between direct medical cost and lost wages. Over a period of time, it has been observed that an uneven distribution of pressure (body weight) across the foot while walking increases wear and tear to knee cartilage and thus leads to Osteoarthritis. Therefore, we propose a novel smart shoe for temporal identification and correction for people with abnormal walking patterns consisting of uneven pressure distributions. Our smart shoes include five pressure sensors, four vibrators, memory storage, a processor, a Bluetooth transceiver, a power supply, and a Smart Software application on a Smartphone which houses a Decision Tree (DT) for walking pattern predictions.

However, most of the studies are limited to either specific groups of patients or specific groups of features, such as MRI, X-ray images or questionnaires. In this study, a machine learning pipeline is proposed to predict knee joint space narrowing (JSN) in KOA patients. The proposed methodology, that is based on multidisciplinary data from the osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) database, employs: (i) a clustering process to identify groups of people with progressing and non-progressing JSN; (ii) a robust feature selection process consisting of filter, wrapper and embedded techniques that identifies the most informative risk factors that contribute to JSN prediction; and (iii) a decision making process based on the evaluation and comparison of various classification algorithms towards the selection and development of the final prediction model for JSN. The evaluation was conducted with respect to model's overall performance, robustness and highest achieved accuracy.

Opposed to the conventional statistical learning, which typically assesses each feature separately, the explainable machine learning method used here offers a generalized model in the connectivity difference between older and middle adults. Based on this method, we found that all three models successfully differentiate middle adult adults from older adults based on whole-brain FNC.

The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of rule extraction in the assessment of AD using decision trees (DT) and random forests (RF) algorithms and integrating the extracted rules within an argumentation- based reasoning framework in order to make the results easy to interpret and explain. The DT and RF algorithms were applied on brain MRI images acquired from normal controls (NC) and AD subjects.

The argumentation model implemented in the Gorgias framework achieved an average accuracy of 91%, exhibiting improved results compared to the models of DT and RF. The overall performance of all models in this study is in agreement with other studies. In addition, the explanations given by our approach for the various possible predictions provide a more useful and complete assessment of the state of the patient/case at hand.

Educating individuals with more accurate measures of fat distribution outside fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) along with preventive solutions to susceptible conditions encourage better lifestyle choices and routines. Essential fat compartments that constitute the total fat distribution are visceral adipose tissue (VAT), superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (SSAT) and deep subcutaneous adipose tissue (DSAT) which can be measured using whole-body MRI from head to foot. We propose a two-stage solution: rapid Dixon sequence acquisition, fat compartment segmentation. A clinically standard and predefined protocol is designed to automate the acquisition with optimal pulse sequence parameters to satisfy any time constraint. Two separate fully convolutional networks (UNet) with attention gates trained on our in-house dataset of 53 patients are used to segment VAT and SAT respectively. Further, the SAT segment is sub-classified into SSAT and DSAT by detecting the fascia superficialis using modified level sets. The models are capable of segmenting VAT, DSAT, and SSAT from head to foot without any manual intervention. Our method achieves a dice score of 0.868 for SAT segmentation and 0.9107 for VAT segmentation. The whole pipeline from data acquisition to reporting can be completed in under 20 minutes. Furthermore, our experiments show that our approach to estimating the segmentations are better than similar deep learning models trained on abdomen MRI.

The aim of this work was to determine how the bacterial and archaeal community was controlled by these extreme conditions.
Materials and methods Sediment samples were collected from the 0-20-cm layer along a crater-wide transect. Physicochemical characteristics and the archaeal and bacterial community were determined by analysis of the 16S rRNA through Illumina sequencing.
Results and discussion The sediment samples had a pH 10 and an electrolytic conductivity (EC) that ranged from 29.8 to 74.4 dSm(-1). Three archaeal and 37 bacterial phyla were detected with Euryarchaeota (relative abundance 62.7 +/- 17.6%) dominating the Archaea, and Proteobacteria (28.2 +/- 10.7%) and Actinobacteria (21.1 +/- 6.4%) the Bacteria. The most abundant archaeal genus was Candidatus Nitrososphaera while Euzebya, Halomonas, KSA1 and Planctomycetes dominated the bacterial gene. Thaumarchaeota were enriched in sediment samples with a higher Pb content and Euryarchaeota in sediment with a higher Mg content, while Crenarchaeota and Candidatus Nitrososphaera were enriched in sediment with a higher sand, total N and organic C content. Proteobacteria were enriched in sediment with a higher organic C and total N, Si and sand content, while Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes in sediment with a higher water holding capacity and clay and Mg content. Members of KSA1 and Euzebya were enriched in sediment with a lower EC, organic C and total N content. Although a large number of bacterial and archaeal groups were correlated significantly with a range of sediment characteristics, the sediment characteristics explained the variation of only two bacterial groups > 50% (TM6 and Desulfonatronospira) using the machine learning tool random-Forest and none of the archaeal groups. Archaeal and bacterial functional guilds were dominated by ammonium oxidation and nitrite reduction.
Conclusions Although the different sediment samples were dominated often by similar bacterial and archaeal groups, the measured sediment characteristics explained little of the variation found between the sampling points. The high bacterial and archaeal diversity indicated that the site might be a source of unclassified species and phylotypes with specific metabolic capacities involved in the N and S cycles.","Alpha diversity,Diversity analysis,Illumina sequencing,Maar,Microbial communities,Transect",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Agriculture",,3.587,"SP,NOV.,DIVERSITY,ARCHAEA,SOIL,SEQUENCES",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,,

Deep learning-based methods represented by U-Net performs very well on the task of retinal vessel segmentation. As the attention mechanism has made breakthroughs in many computer vision tasks, it has attracted the attention from the researcher. This paper proposed a kind of U-Net network based on triple attention mechanism-3AU-Net to overcome the problems of retinal vessel segmentation. We follow the framework of U-Net 's full convolution and skip connection, integrating spatial attention mechanism with channel attention mechanism and context attention mechanism. Spatial attention allows the segmentation network to find the blood vessel region that needs attention, thereby suppressing noise. Channel attention can make the expression of features more diverse and highlight the feature channels with key information. The context attention can integrate the context information to make the network to focus on the key pixels. Experimental consequences have indicated that 3AU-Net can greatly improve the results of the segmentation of retinal blood vessels, and this method surpasses other deep learning-based methods in many indicators on the DRIVE and STARE fundus image data sets. On the DRIVE data set, the 3A-UNet model achieved excellent performance on multiple evaluation indicators, with an ACC score of 0.9592, an AUC score of 0.9770, and a sensitivity score of 0.8537.","deep learning,medical image,Fundus image processing,retinal vessel segmentation",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Transportation",,,,PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL AVIATION SAFETY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICCASIT),,

The availability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria (MTB) in that specimen confirms the existence of TB. The other examinations strongly recommend that, TB in the diagnosis, one cannot confirm it. A simple skin test is the most generally utilized diagnostic equipment for TB, though blood tests are becoming more common. A small quantity of a substance termed PPD (Post-Partum Depression) tuberculin is injected below the skin of one's inside forearm. Sometimes, false negative treatment may also results. Thus several upcoming techniques are introduced to cure the TB. It is based upon the CAD system that deals with the problem of TB detection on CXR. It is maintained by the training dataset. The drawback that occurs on the previous model is that its inherent features are uncertain. The novel 3 methods implemented in this research are i) Lung Segment, ii) Texture Feature Extraction as well as iii) Pixel classification. Along with these, miSVM+PEDD (multiple instances Support Vector Machine + Probability Estimation and Data Discarding) is used for the segmentation process. Thus the model should be evaluated by implementing some recent features of the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). The Improved Algorithm is deployed by training a MIL classifier which builds from other machine learning (ML), Active Learning (AL) and 1-class classification approaches. Here, the uncertainty intrinsic to a MIL pixel classifier is diminished while minimizing the labeling exertions. The uses of AL are centered on the image and text categorization. The resulting lung likelihood map is post-processed to obtain binary segmentation. Here, the MIL is integrated with the AL Model. The results are analyzed by contrasting the proposed system with the other prevailing techniques to prove the dominance of the proposed one.","Tuberculosis,CAD,CNN,Bag of words,miSVM plus PEDD,MIL",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Medical Informatics,,,"COMPUTER-AIDED,DETECTION",HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY,,

A detailed and scientific understanding of the class to which a biomass resource belongs is therefore highly essential for energy generation. An intelligent classification of biomass resources based on properties offers a high prospect in analytical, operational and strategic decision-making. This study proposes the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification model to classify biomass based on their properties. The study scientifically classified 214 biomass dataset obtained from several articles published in reputable journals. Four different values of k (k = 1, 2,3,4) were experimented for various self normalizing distance functions and their results compared for effectiveness and efficiency in order to determine the optimal model. The k-NN model based on Mahalanobis distance function revealed a great accuracy at k = 3 with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Accuracy, Error, Sensitivity, Specificity, False positive rate, Kappa statistics and Computation time (in seconds) of 1.42, 0.703, 0.297, 0.580, 0.953, 0.047, 0.622, and 4.7 respectively. The authors concluded that k NN based classification model is feasible and reliable for biomass classification. The implementation of this classification models shows that k NN can serve as a handy tool for biomass resources classification irrespective of the sources and origins. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This neurodegenerative pathology affects generally old people. Its symptoms are loss of memory followed over the years by more hard ability of expression and various handicaps. Therefore, early detection of AD is become an active research area in recent years. In this paper, we propose a deep based method for the detection of AD (i.e. classify brain images into normal brain or brain with AD). The proposed method contains two main steps. The first step is region of interest extraction; it is based on the partition of the image into separate blocks to extract only the part that contains the hippocampus of the brain. The second step is the classification of images using two deep based techniques namely convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. In one hand, CNN allows extracting the characteristics from brain images, then classifies them into normal brain or AD brain. Transfer Learning, in the other hand, consists of using features acquired from the Alexnet architecture to classify the images. We have assessed the proposed method on Oasis dataset (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). The obtained results show that the classification of images using Transfer Learning with 92.86% outperformed the CNN's classification rate.","Alzheimer's disease,Region of interest,Classification,Convolutional neural network,Transfer Learning,Alexnet",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,,,

Our framework mainly consists of two neural networks: a multi-modal image translation network for style transfer and a cascaded segmentation network for image segmentation. The multi-modal image translation network generates realistic and diverse synthetic LGE images conditioned on a single annotated bSSFP image, forming a synthetic LGE training set. This set is then utilized to fine-tune the segmentation network pre-trained on labelled bSSFP images, achieving the goal of unsupervised LGE image segmentation. In particular, the proposed cascaded segmentation network is able to produce accurate segmentation by taking both shape prior and image appearance into account, achieving an average Dice score of 0.92 for the left ventricle, 0.83 for the myocardium, and 0.88 for the right ventricle on the test set.",,Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/23501/1/1908.07344v3.pdf,

However, most current deep learning approaches do not fully utilize the information from multi-sequence (MS) cardiac magnetic resonance. In this work, the deep learning method is used to fully-automatic segment the MS CMR data. The balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) cine sequence is used to perform left ventricular positioning as a priori knowledge, and then the Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) cine sequence is used for precise segmentation. This segmentation strategy makes full use of the complementary information from the MS CMR data. Moreover, to solve the anisotropy of volumetric medical images, we employ the Pseudo-3D convolution neural network structure to segment the LGE CMR data, which combines the advantage of 2D networks and preserving the spatial structure information in 3D data without compromising segmentation accuracy. Experimental results of the Multi-sequence Cardiac MR Segmentation Challenge (MS-CMRSeg 2019) show that our approach has achieved gratifying results even with limited GPU computing resources and small amounts of annotated data.

However, due to the existence of domain shift among different modalities of datasets, the performance of deep neural networks drops significantly when the training and testing datasets are distinct. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain alignment method to explicitly alleviate the domain shifts among different modalities of CMR sequences, e.g., bSSFP, LGE, and T2-weighted. Our segmentation network is attention U-Net with pyramid pooling module, where multilevel feature space and output space adversarial learning are proposed to transfer discriminative domain knowledge across different datasets. Moreover, we further introduce a group-wise feature recalibration module to enforce the fine-grained semantic-level feature alignment that matching features from different networks but with the same class label.

As the infarcted myocardium can be enhanced in LGE CMR through appearing with distinctive brightness compared with the healthy tissues, it can help doctors better study the presence, location, and extent of MI in clinical diagnosis. Hence it is of great significance to delineate ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR images. In this study, we proposed a multi-modal cardiac MR image segmentation strategy via combining the T2-weighted CMR and the balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) CMR sequence. Specifically, the T2-weighted CMR and bSSFP are co-registered and set as the input of the convolution neural network to do the first stage segmentation in bSSFP space. By predicting all the labels, we further registered T2-weighted CMR, bSSFP and the corresponding labels into LGE space, and as an input to the convolution neural network to do the second stage segmentation. In the end, we post-processed the output masks to further ensure the accuracy of the segmentation results.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation rely on supervision with pixel-level annotations, and may not generalize well to images from a different domain. These methods are typically sensitive to variations in imaging protocols and data acquisition. Since annotating multi-sequence CMR images is tedious and subject to inter- and intra-observer variations, developing methods that can automatically adapt from one domain to the target domain is of great interest. In this paper, we propose an approach for domain adaptation in multi-sequence CMR segmentation task using transfer learning that combines multi-source image information. We first train an encoder-decoder CNN on T2-weighted and balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) MR images with pixel-level annotation and fine-tune the same network with a limited number of Late Gadolinium Enhanced-MR (LGE-MR) subjects, to adapt the domain features. The domain-adapted network was trained with just four LGE-MR training samples and obtained an average Dice score of similar to 85.0% on the test set comprises of 40 LGE-MR subjects. The proposed method significantly outperformed a network without adaptation trained from scratch on the same set of LGE-MR training data.","Multi-sequence MRI,Deep learning,Domain adaptation,Myocardial infraction,MRI segmentation",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/159510/1/1908.07726.pdf,

However, fully automatic segmentation of multi-sequence cardiac MR is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of cardiac anatomy. In this study, we propose a two-stage deep learning scheme for automatic segmentation of volumetric multi-sequence MR images by leveraging both 2D and 3D U-Net. In the first stage, a 2D U-Net model coupled with the iterative randomized Hough transform is employed on the balanced-steady state free precession (bSSFP) MR sequences, so as to find the center coordinates of the left ventricles (LVs). The regions of interest (ROIs) are then localized around the center coordinates on the corresponding late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) MR sequences. In the second stage, a 3D probabilistic U-Net model is performed on the ROIs in the LGE data to segment the LV, right ventricle (RV) and left ventricular myocardium (MYO). Experimental results on the MICCAI 2019 Multi-Sequence Cardiac MR Segmentation (MS-CMRSeg) Challenge show that the proposed scheme performs well with average Dice similarity coefficients of LV, RV and MYO as 0.792, 0.697 and 0.611, respectively.","Multi-sequence Cardiac MR,U-Net,Iterative randomized Hough transform,Image segmentation",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,MAGNETIC-RESONANCE,,,

Manual delineation of those tissues in cardiac MR (CMR) scans is laborious and time-consuming. The ambiguity of the boundaries makes the segmentation task rather challenging. Furthermore, the annotations on some modalities such as Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI, are often not available. We propose an end-to-end segmentation framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and adversarial learning. A dilated residual U-shape network is used as a segmentor to generate the prediction mask; meanwhile, a CNN is utilized as a discriminator model to judge the segmentation quality. To leverage the available annotations across modalities per patient, a new loss function named weak domain-transfer loss is introduced to the pipeline. The proposed model is evaluated on the public dataset released by the challenge organizer in MICCAI 2019, which consists of 45 sets of multi-sequence CMR images.
