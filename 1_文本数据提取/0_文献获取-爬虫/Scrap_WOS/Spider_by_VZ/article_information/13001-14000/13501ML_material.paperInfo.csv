The main constraint is that 100% of the power input must be solar, hence most of the cars body will be covered with flexible solar panels. This solar power will charge a rechargeable battery, which supplies a motor for movement. There are three modes of operation: 1. Manual by PS4 controller, 2. Muse monitor headset for electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals and 3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Control. A Convolutional Neural Network system will be established that will break down the electroencephalogram brain signals (EEG) into four categories stop, forward, left, and right.

2,Quantitative Prediction of Perovskite Stability Using Accelerated Testing and Machine Learning,,,2116-2118,"Hillhouse Hugh W.,Dunlap-Shohl Wiley A.,Stoddard Ryan J.","Hillhouse HW,Dunlap-Shohl WA,Stoddard RJ",Hillhouse HW,,University of Washington,"PV technologies based on hybrid perovskites offer the potential for reducing solar cell costs, but they are particularly vulnerable to degradation by environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, and illumination. Commercialization will require not only stable materials and device architectures but also accelerated testing protocols and models that can predict degradation from the accelerated testing data. Here, we report results from in situ photoluminescence (PL) and photoconductivity (PC) measurements during perovskite degradation with simultaneous optical transmittance (Tr) measurements or reflected dark field (DF) imaging. From PL, PC, Tr, and DF, we determine (respectively) the steady-state quasi-Fermi level splitting, the mean effective carrier diffusion length, the extent of conversion of perovskite to higher bandgap degradation products, and the extent of scattering from domains with different orientation or composition, all as a function of time during degradation. Simultaneous measurement of PL-PC-Tr or PL-PC-DF on perovskite absorbers in an environmental chamber over a wide range of humidity, oxygen, temperature, and illumination levels yields a rich data set. We use machine learning to develop a model that accurately predicts (within 10%) the time for the diffusion length to decrease to 85% of its initial value. The model takes the environmental conditions and the first few measurements from the PL-PC-Tr or PL-PC-DF experiment as input. Thus, the model provides a framework to interpret the results of accelerated testing of absorber materials. One of the dominant features in the model of degradation for CH3NH3PbI3 is the initial rate at which transmittance increase. For devices with opaque contacts, the pixel-averaged rate of change of the intensity in dark-field images can be used in place of transmittance. Results are also presented on full PV devices with in-situ current-voltage (JV) measurements. The data from simultaneous PL-DF-JV under environmental stresses reveal intimate connection between degradation and shunts and provide a framework to extend accelerated testing to devices. Further, the presentation reveals underlying universal behavior in degradation pathways over a broad range of environmental stresses and perovskite compositions.","perovskite,degradation,prediction,machine learning,transmittance,dark field,photoconductivity,diffusion length",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,,"BEHAVIOR,LIGHT",,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1811440,

But it is a time-taking task and error-prone process by radiologists or clinical experts. Several works have been introduced in brain tumor detection but it failed to discover the exact location and characterization of the lesion. In order to improve the automatic tumor lesion localization and characterization, an efficient machine learning technique called Lee Filtered Bivariate Correlative Regression based Extreme Gradient Boosting (LFBCR-EGB) is introduced. Initially ""n"" numbers ofMRI brain images are taken from the database. The LFBCR-EGB technique comprises three major processes, namely preprocessing, lesion localization, and characterization. The regression function is used to find the positive and negative similarity between the pixels in an image. The negative similarity result provides the exact localization results with minimum time. Finally, the lesion characterization is done by applying an extreme gradient boosting technique to improve the accuracy with certain features. The features are extracted from the ROI and they construct several weak learners. The ID3 classifier is used as weak learners of the extreme gradient boosting technique to classify normal or abnormal tissue based on the information gain. In this way, the LFBCR-EGB technique performs accurate and fast tumor detection along with the exact location of the tumor. Experimental evaluation of the proposed LFBCR-EGB technique is carried out using MRI brain image database with different factors such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, lesion localization time, and classification accuracy. The simulation results show that the proposed LFBCR-EGB technique obtains better results in terms of peak signal ratio and classification accuracy with lesion localization time.","Magnetic resonance (MR) images,Lesion localization,Characterization,Bivariate correlated regression,Feature extraction,Extreme gradient boosting technique",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE","Computer Science,Telecommunications",,,SEGMENTATION,,,

In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning technology, many algorithms have emerged to apply convolutional neural networks to this task, achieving promising results. However, there are still some problems such as low denoising efficiency, over-smoothed result, etc. In this paper, we propose the Edge enhancement based Densely connected Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN). In our network, we design an edge enhancement module using the proposed novel trainable Sobel convolution. Based on this module, we construct a model with dense connections to fuse the extracted edge information and realize end-to-end image denoising. Besides, when training the model, we introduce a compound loss that combines MSE loss and multi-scales perceptual loss to solve the over-smoothed problem and attain a marked improvement in image quality after denoising. Compared with the existing low-dose CT image denoising algorithms, our proposed model has a better performance in preserving details and suppressing noise.","Low-dose CT,denoising,convolutional network,EDCNN,edge enhancement,trainable Sobel,compound loss",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Engineering,Telecommunications",,,"COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,RISK",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00139,

Using these two information measures, we have shown that with a minimum of six highest information valued heart sound features, satisfactory classification accuracy can be achieved.

With the continuous development of deep learning, these two tasks are increasingly integrated to realize panoramic image segmentation. This paper proposes a panoramic image segmentation network. Firstly, the bisenet network architecture is integrated to the image segmentation branch; secondly, in the image detection branch, the mask-rcnn network architecture is employed for this network; thirdly, these two branches use the same backbone network for simultaneous training and mutual improvement.

To make up this, we introduce a new, large-scale EV-Action dataset in this work, which consists of RGB, depth, electromyography (EMG), and two skeleton modalities. Compared with the conventional datasets, EV-Action dataset has two major improvements: (1) we deploy a motion capturing system to obtain high quality skeleton modality, which provides more comprehensive motion information including skeleton, trajectory, acceleration with higher accuracy, sampling frequency, and more skeleton markers. (2) we introduce an EMG modality which is usually used as an effective indicator in the biomechanics area, also it has yet to be well explored in motion related research.

Frequency domain representations of the resulting data are then classified using supervised learning. Overall, the proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 82.5% when discriminating between those with PD and those without, and 61.8% when discriminating between those with PD with treatment, with PD without treatment, and those without PD. These results increased up to 91.8% and 73.5%, respectively, when combining the predictions of multiple models. To understand the contributions of each part of our framework we perform systematic ablation studies.

Building an automatic recognition system can help in early detection of symptoms and providing insights into the biological markers for diagnosis. It is, however, a challenging task as it requires taking into account indicators from different modalities, such as facial expressions, gestures, acoustic features and verbal content. To address this issue, we propose a general-purpose multimodal deep learning framework, in which multiple modalities - including acoustic, visual and textual features - are processed individually with the cross-modality correlation considered. Specifically, a Multimodal Deep Denoising Autoencoder (multi-DDAE) is designed to obtain multimodal representations of audio-visual features followed by the Fisher Vector encoding which produces session-level descriptors. For textual modality, a Paragraph Vector (PV) is proposed to embed the transcripts of interview sessions into document representations capturing cues related to mental disorders. Following an early fusion strategy, both audio-visual and textual features are then fused prior to feeding them to a Multitask Deep Neural Network (DNN) as the final classifier. Our framework is evaluated on the automatic detection of two mental disorders: bipolar disorder (BD) and depression, using two datasets: Bipolar Disorder Corpus (BDC) and the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (E-DAIC), respectively. Our experimental evaluation results showed comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in BD and depression detection, thus demonstrating the effective multimodal representation learning and the capability to generalise across different mental disorders.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,,,,

On top of manually designed solutions, the deep-learning approach appears in rPPG estimation and achieves top-level performance. However, most of them try to integrate the steps of both preprocessing and ROI selection into an end-to-end network, which limits the generalization in other applications that use different input skin regions. The ROI selection model learned on face videos may not adapt to skin regions from other body parts with different appearance and size. In this paper, we leave the preprocessing apart and propose a lightweight rPPG estimation network-DeeprPPG for general use. DeeprPPG is based on spatiotemporal convolutions and can be used as a well-defined module in wider application scenarios with different types of input skin. To further boost the robustness, a spatiotemporal rPPG aggregation strategy is designed to adaptively aggregate rPPG signals from multiple skin regions into the final one.

In this paper, we describe the collection setup, provide several action recognition baselines with OpenPose feature extraction, and make the database, evaluation protocol and all annotations publicly available. The database contains 192 sessions recorded with up to three cameras, with 332 single action clips and 119 multiple action sequences.

Many methods use or learn facial action units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for describing facial expressions with muscle movement.

We study methods that learn sequence-level metrics from frame-level metrics. Specifically, we explore an extended multitask learning model to predict VAS from human-labeled AUs with the help of other sequence-level pain measurements during training. This model consists of two parts: a multitask learning neural network model to predict multidimensional pain scores, and an ensemble learning model to linearly combine the multidimensional pain scores to best approximate VAS. Starting from human-labeled AUs, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) on VAS of 1.73. It outperforms provided human sequence-level estimates which have an MAE of 1.76.

Significant variations in the size, shape and colour of objects are involved, along with potentially large variations in the environmental conditions, must be accommodated to implement such a robust and effective system. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results for object classifications. However, the scarcity of training datasets due to the diversity of varieties and applications of fruit and vegetable classification is a significant limitation to the CNN implementation for this task. To overcome this, we propose the use of transfer learning and ensemble technique. Specifically, a transfer learning based weighted average weight optimisation ensemble technique is applied to the weights of GoogleNet and MobileNet by transfer learning the pre-trained CNNs using a custom dataset. Two hyperparameter optimisation techniques have been applied in a sequential way to identify the effective weights progressively. The optimised weights are used as an input to a normalised exponential softmax layer to estimate the final probability distribution for classification. A comparative evaluation among standalone GoogleNet, MobileNet and different levels of ensemble has been presented, which supports the adoption of this technique as a solution in a real-world supermarket environment.","Transfer learning,Knowledge transfer,Ensemble learning,Fruit and vegetables,Classification,Deep learning,Convolutional Neural Network",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Robotics",,,,,,

We introduce the first ""smart"" engine to govern the components of such imagers in a mixed reality setting. Namely, a closed-loop hardware system that optimizes cross-talk between the virtual mask generated from the NIR measurement and the projected augmenting image is proposed. Such real-virtual image translation is accomplished in several steps. First, the NIR vein segmentation task is solved using U-Net-based network architecture and the Frangi vesselness filter. The generated mask is then transformed and translated into the visible domain by a projector that adjusts for distortions and misalignment with the true vasculature using the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

The automated segmentation of tumors in PET images is a fundamental requirement for image analysis in computer aided diagnosis systems. Current tumor segmentation in PET generally relies on local features to discriminate tumor from the background. These methods are limited due to poor resolution, and subtle inter-class differences when there is normal FDG uptake region (i.e., in the heart and mediastinum) in the same field of view. We propose a new image based discriminative method to separate tumor regions from normal regions. We introduce a convolutional adversarial auto-encoder to learn a latent space which models normal (disease-free) variations of PET images, and then to compute a residual map that identifies where the PET image differs from this manifold due to anomalies, i.e., tumors. Our method is tolerant to normal intra-class variations among the PET images but is discriminative of the tumors with high sensitivity. Our experiments with a clinical lung cancer dataset show that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods.

Most of the hand-crafted techniques have various limitations which reduce their potentials to accurately classify medical X-ray images. For more than a decade, various researchers have employed the use of different handcrafted techniques for medical image classification. However, the major problem associated with the techniques is their inability to extract discriminative features that are relevant enough to accurately classify medical images such as radiographic images. This study focuses on employing deep learning and fusion technique to classify medical X-ray images. The proposed technique uses a single pre-trained neural network and a late fusion technique for the classification of ImageCLEF 2007 and 2015 dataset. The employment of a single pre-trained neural network, both as a feature extractor and as a fine-tuned network, makes the technique unique especially when considering the nature of the dataset used. The combination of the posterior probabilities generated from SVM and Softmax classifiers using a single deep pre-trained neural network produces an overall classification accuracy of 95.54% in classifying the dataset into 116 categories on ImageCLEF 2007. This is the highest when compared to the use of AlexNet + SVM and fine-tuned AlexNet alone which produced 84.35% and 86.47% classification accuracies respectively.

False positives (FPs) are therefore a common occurrence in the outputs of different detectors. This paper focuses on FP reduction and improvement of the final MCs detection accuracy in mammograms. The proposed method uses a combination of a MC detector which outputs a patch set containing candidate MC spots, and alpha images derived from multifractal analysis to enhance texture features of MC spots in each target patch. For further highlighting the texture features, a Weber's law based approach is used to construct a new multifractal measure and the corresponding alpha patches. In order to distinguish MC spots from the candidate set, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is designed to process original mammogram patches and corresponding alpha patches together for classifying suspicious MC spots to true positive group or false positive group. Multifractal features contained in alpha images are fed into the proposed CNN model, which facilitate learning richer representations for MCs in local regions and presenting better classification performance. A digital mammogram dataset, INbreast, is used to test the proposed method. Experimental results are evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) and area under the FROC curve (AUC). In our experiments, a desirable classification performance is observed after using the new alpha patch set in the designed CNN classifier, and the general MC detection results based on individual mammograms in a test set demonstrate that the proposed method reduces FP numbers and improves the MC detection accuracy effectively.","SEGMENTATION,MAMMOGRAMS",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Robotics",,,"SEGMENTATION,MAMMOGRAMS",,,

The attention features help to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, the pyramid augmented attention module encodes spatial features into local features, while the channel augmented attention module models channel-wise interdependencies between features.

To increase survival rates, it is found that it is very effective to early detect breast cancer. Mammography-based breast cancer screening is the leading technology to achieve this aim. However, it still can not deal with patients with dense breast nor with tumor size less than 2 mm. Thermography-based breast cancer approach can address these problems.

The full automation of this process remains a challenge due to intra- and internuclear variations across a wide range of tissue morphologies, differences in staining protocols and imaging procedures. (2) Methods: A deep learning model with metric embeddings such as contrastive loss and triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining is proposed in order to accurately segment cell nuclei in a diverse set of microscopy images. The effectiveness of the proposed model was tested on a large-scale multi-tissue collection of microscopy image sets. (3) Results: The use of deep metric learning increased the overall segmentation prediction by 3.12% in the average value of Dice similarity coefficients as compared to no metric learning. In particular, the largest gain was observed for segmenting cell nuclei in H&E-stained images when deep learning network and triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining were considered for the task. (4) Conclusion: We conclude that deep metric learning gives an additional boost to the overall learning process and consequently improves the segmentation performance.

According to the findings from numerous studies and surveys on thyroid disease, it is estimated that about 42 million people in India and around 20 million people in America are suffering from some form of thyroid diseases, and women make up the majority of thyroid patients among them. It is caused due to the under (Hypothyroidism) or over (Hyperthyroidism) functionality of thyroid gland, which is responsible for maintaining the metabolism of the body, and it is imperative to diagnose its effects as early as possible so that a possible cure or treatment can be performed at the earliest. This paper aims to propose a modified ant lion optimization algorithm (MALO) for improving the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid disease. The proposed MALO is employed as a feature selection method to identify the most significant set of attributes from a large pool of available attributes to improve the classification accuracy and to reduce the computational time. Feature selection is one of the most significant aspects of machine learning which is used to remove the insignificant features from a given dataset to improve the accuracy of machine learning classifiers. Three different classifiers, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Decision Tree, are used for diagnosing the thyroid disease. The experimental results indicate that MALO eliminates 71.5% insignificant features out of the total number of features. The best accuracy achieved on the reduced set of features is 95.94% with Random Forest Classifier. Also, a notable accuracy of 95.66% and 92.51% has been achieved by Decision Tree classifier and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier, respectively. Additionally, MALO has been compared with other optimized variants of evolutionary algorithms to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm. Hence, the experimental results indicate that the MALO significantly outperforms the other algorithms present in the literature.","Thyroid disease,Ant Lion optimization algorithm,Modified Ant Lion optimization algorithm,Evolutionary algorithm,Feature selection,Machine learning",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,,,,,

Thus, Deep Learning-based methods have been practiced to facilitate early DED detection and address the issues currently faced. Despite promising, highly accurate detection of early anatomical changes in the eye using Deep Learning remains a challenge in wide scale practical application.

However, designs of fully grouted anchors are commonly based on the calculation of the ultimate pullout capacity along with safety factors, which results in unnecessary economic loss. This is partly due to the fact that it is impractical to predict the anchor performance without strong assumptions of how steel tendons, soils, rock, and grout can collectively resist pullout force or without detailed information of the ground parameters. As one of the promising fields within the framework of artificial intelligence, Machine Learning (ML) has been increasingly used to address geotechnical problems by giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is an ML nonparametric algorithm that is based on a data-driven process. This paper presents the development of a MARS performance prediction model using data from 530 anti-floating anchor pullout tests in 8 different projects in weathered soils and rocks located in Shenzhen, China. In this study, MARS demonstrates the capabilities to capture the complex nonlinear relationships in the anti-floating anchor pullout problem.

The efficiency of the model is tested on a voice measurement dataset that is collected from ""UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository."" The dynamics of chaos optimization algorithm will enhance the firefly algorithm by introducing six types of chaotic maps which will increase the diversification and intensification capability of chaos-based firefly algorithm.

The experimental study of the problem established that chaos-based logistic model overshadowed other chaotic models. In addition, four widely used classifiers such as Naive Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and radial basis function classifier are used to prove the generalization and stability of the logistic chaotic model.

This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on feature fusion, which can automatically learn and classify features from time-domain(TD) and frequency-domain(FD). To make full use of information, two fusion methods are used and compared. Experiments show that the proposed fusion methods are superior to the traditional algorithm for both normal people and amputees, and have better performance compared with CNN method using only one kind of information.","Convolutional neural network (CNN),gestures recognition,neural decoding,surface electromyogram (sEMG)",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,1.797,"SEMG,HAND,RECOGNITION",JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,,

Early symptoms such as muscle stiffness, tremors, impaired balance and difficulty with walking are considerably less noticeable. Blood tests and Scans also do not provide sufficient evidence for early diagnosis. Hence it is very difficult for doctors to diagnose the onset of Parkinson's Disease. However, smearing of speech gives an early warning and can be effectively used for the prediction of PD. This paper, the voice recording samples of Parkinson's disease affected and healthy patients have been used for PD prediction. Thirteen predictive models using various Machine Learning techniques have been formulated using the University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset. A comparative study of these predictive models has been carried out on the UCI dataset consisting of biomedical voice recording samples of healthy and Parkinson's Disease affected peoples. These predictive models have been trained and tested for their accuracy and efficiency.

There is a more urgent need for a simple and low cost portable ultrasound device for each elderly resident at risk in retirement communities and independent living facilities to monitor their lung conditions, to find out if their lung condition is getting worse with COVID-19 during self-quarantine phase or if it's getting better during their recovery phase. Various complicated convolutional neural networks have been developed with very high accuracy but health professionals find it hard to understand and trust such complex models due to the lack of intuition and explanation of their predictions. In this work, we proposed to use an interpretable Subspace Approximation with Adjusted Bias (Saab) multilayer network to screen the lung ultrasound images. Such subspace representations learned from a successive subspace network will provide more invariance to intra-class variability and thus give better discrimination for a task such as classification. We demonstrated the advantage of using Saab Subspace Network to design a low-complexity, low-cost, low-power-consumption solution for interpreting and visualizing features of the lung ultrasound images to confirm the classifier recommendation.

Yield improvement is done by collecting, analyzing, identifying the causes of defects, and applying corrective actions to resolve the root causes. With the ongoing miniaturization of TSVs, micro-bumps, RDLs, and other package interconnects [1], detecting defects in these buried interconnects is becoming more difficult as well as more important.
Traditionally semiconductor packages are cross-sectioned to identify internal process defects such as unsolders, solder shorts, and pad misalignment. Cross-sectioning is a destructive approach, is difficult to do, and provides information in a single 2D plane only. Due to the large effort and the destructive nature of this approach, the amount of data that can be generated is typically quite limited. The development of 3D x-ray microscopy provides industry with the capability to image and analyze buried features such as micro-bumps, TSVs, and other metallic structures using a non-destructive, 3-dimensional technology [2]. At the same time, deep learning has revolutionized other technologies such as visual surveillance, predictive maintenance [3], object detection [4], and is now revolutionizing defect detection in semiconductors. When used together, the combination of 3D x-ray microscopy and deep learning is establishing a new paradigm in package inspection and metrology.
In this paper, we will present a novel method for automatically detecting internal anomalies in semiconductor packages and using deep learning to assess the attributes of these interconnects. Chips representative of stacked 2.5D packages were fabricated and assembled using thermo-compression bonding. Bonding parameters were varied in order to create packages with different bond line thickness, different solder fillet shapes, and various pad alignment scenarios. A commercial 3D x-ray imaging tool was used to create high-quality tomographies of these packages. Deep-learning and computer vision-based methods were employed to automatically detect internal features and measure attributes. A three-step procedure was used for data analysis. In the first step, a bounding box was detected for each region of interest (Copper Pillar, Pad, etc.) using a modified single shot detector object model. In the second step, we isolated features within the region of interest and performed 3D segmentation on them. The third and final step utilized automated 3D metrology using the segmented regions. Robust 3D computer vision techniques were deployed to measure the extent of voids which are key attributes for the chip fabrication and process control step.

Magnification level is an important factor as pathologist views the biopsy samples at various magnifications to reach a diagnosis. Whereas WSIs generally do contain the magnification information, microscopic snapshots are often captured without attaching the magnification information. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, Kimia-5MAG, consisting of 33,345 patches at 5 different magnification classes created from WSIs made publicly available by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). There exists a large number of microscopic snapshots captured from camera-mounted microscopes but are of little use for automatic processing due to lack of magnification information. One direction to make use of these datasets is learning the magnification level from high resolutions captured WSIs and transferring the knowledge to microscopic snapshots.

Recently, numerous methods have been proposed to boost the segmentation performance based on U-shape network. However, they often built feature encoders with only one data routine, which have limited the representation ability of the networks. Although some methods applied multiple learning paths to fix this problem, the deep supervision techniques are required to monitor the training status at individual path, which may bring extra burden to practical usage of the algorithm. Additionally, under these frameworks, the semantic gap between different paths may interfere with model's learning performance, and the potential transduction ability of skip connections still needs further investigation. To address these issues, we introduce a novel medical image segmentation framework, namely AFT-Net, in which an attention-based data fusion model is proposed to effectively cooperate with multi-stream encoder. By progressively accumulating the features from different paths, our method can establish meaningful connections between structural and semantic features, while keeping an integral and flexible layout without deeply customized supervisions.

Hence, when it comes to using the data in machine learning, there are not enough cases of the diseased participants for the algorithm to train a model.
We have developed techniques to overcome this limitation by up-sampling the positive cases. To validate our technique we have evaluated its reliability by comparing the augmented data set with the original data distribution using the Wilcoxon signed rank statistical significance test. We have also compared the results with and without data augmentation on the XGBoost classifier, and have used the AUC (area under the curve) and the Cohen's Kappa as the evaluation metrics.

First of all, the dataset is pre-processed in which the data normalization is performed and the missing values are removed. Following the previous step, feature selection is performed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, 8 classifiers are applied on the various data splits. Finally, Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity are calculated. The maximum accuracy of 89.74% is obtained using SVM and Naive Bayes after applying feature selection method on 90-10 data split.","Arrhythmia,PCA,SVM,Naive bayes",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,,,,,

More than 70% of the cases are in critical stage accounting to low chances of survival. There were many studies on rampant spread of cancer in the recent past, and one main reason is the lack of breastfeeding at the infant stage. Studies observed that Human Alpha-lactalbumin (HAMLET) controls tumor cells which are found in breast milk, can destroy cancer cells and safeguard against cancer. U.S. national library study on medicine found that HAMLET destroys cancer cells just like Programmed Cell Death. It was observed that HAMLET has very good anti-tumor activity. In this paper, we tried to find the impact of breastfeeding in the grownups in resisting the cancer and the relation between incidences of cancer in breastfed grownups and their resistant levels to cancer with particular reference to India through data (a survey of cancer patients). Chi-square test has been implemented on the survey data to check dependence of breastfed and non-breastfed cancer patients. We applied linear regression machine learning model for finding correlation between attributes.","HAMLET,Breast fed,Non breast fed,Age and family history",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,,,,,

Malaria is one of the most rapidly spreading and contagious diseases, mostly spread through microbes. Efficient treatment of the disease requires early and accurate estimation to ensure control from spreading and treatment in early phases. Accordingly, several studies have been put forward during the past decade. Analyzing the blood smear's images is one of the prominent works proposed in this context. This manuscript attempts to automate the process of diagnosis through machine learning techniques. The algorithm trains the model through different selected features of the input images and thereby uses the learning experience to classify the blood smears as disease prone or healthy. The cuckoo search algorithm is used for designing a heuristic scale, which is further assessed through multiple experiments to evaluate its accuracy. Different performance evaluation measures like precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are used to assess the robustness of the model toward early identification of malaria in the premature stage.","Malaria,Erythrocyte,Red blood cells (RBCs),Blood smear,Principal component analysis (PCA),K-means algorithm,Canonical correlation analysis (CCA)",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD, 152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Computer Science,,,"SEGMENTATION,PARASITES",,,

However, most of existing Bayesian optimization algorithms can only handle vector data and cannot handle complex structured data. In this paper, we propose the topological Bayesian optimization, which can efficiently find an optimal solution from structured data using topological information. More specifically, in order to apply Bayesian optimization to structured data, we extract useful topological information from a structure and measure the proper similarity between structures. To this end, we utilize persistent homology, which is a topological data analysis method that was recently applied in machine learning. Moreover, we propose the Bayesian optimization algorithm that can handle multiple types of topological information by using a linear combination of kernels for persistence diagrams. Through experiments, we show that topological information extracted by persistent homology contributes to a more efficient search for optimal structures compared to the random search baseline and the graph Bayesian optimization algorithm.",,Proceedings Paper,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,,,,

A good customer experience at the RVM is crucial for a further proliferation of this technology. Bin full events are the major reason for Reverse Vending Machine (RVM) downtime at the world leader in the RVM market. The paper at hand develops and evaluates an approach based on machine learning and statistical approximation to foresee bin full events and, thus increase uptime of RVMs. Our approach relies on forecasting the hourly time series of returned beverage containers at a given RVM. We contribute by developing and evaluating an approach for hourly forecasts in a retail setting - this combination of application domain and forecast granularity is novel. A trace-driven simulation confirms that the forecasting-based approach leads to less downtime and costs than naive emptying strategies.","Machine learning,Time series forecasting,Retail forecasting,Plastic packaging recycling",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Business & Economics,Computer Science",,,"SCIENCE,RESEARCH,DESIGN,SCIENCE,DEMAND,UNIVARIATE,PRICES",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13304,
