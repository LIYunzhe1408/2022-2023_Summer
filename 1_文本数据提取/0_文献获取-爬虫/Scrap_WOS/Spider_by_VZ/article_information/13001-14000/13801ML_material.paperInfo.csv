1,High-precision thermography based on JMAP inference for human face temperature,11559,,,"Chu Ning,Zhong Yao,Hou Yaochun","Chu N,Zhong Y,Hou YC",Chu N,10.1117/12.2574940,Zhejiang University,"During the pandemic Covid-19, infrared thermography is an efficient way to detect susceptible persons with abnormal temperatures. However, two significant factors seriously limit the temperature precision: measurement uncertainty of the infrared camera and model inaccuracy of thermal radiation. In this paper, we propose the joint maximum a posterior (JMAP) approach with a new hierarchical prior model. The advantages of JMAP are that the Bayesian inference can combine prior model and likelihood model to regulate the uncertainty from both physics and measurements. At first, we obtain the estimated parameters of the thermal radiation model from training-data. We propose that the distribution of actual temperature and the distribution of measurement error satisfy the Gaussian distribution. We take the variance of the Gaussian distribution as the latent variable and assume that the variance satisfies the inverse gamma distribution, which we control by setting hyperparameters, which determine the uncertainty of the temperature variance so that variances are updated continuously rather than constants. We apply the JMAP inference to test human-face temperature for infrared camera calibration. Although the pre-set parameters of the cost-effective infrared camera badly affect the accuracy, our proposed approach can refine the error of less than 0.1. compared with 1.0. without calibration at certain distances. Therefore, our proposed approach can offer an efficient and accurate way to screen people with abnormal body temperature against Covid-19.","thermography,joint maximum a posterior,thermal radiation model,temperature compensation",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

However, the existing classification systems involves large number of input variables for training and produces a large number of fuzzy rules, which lead to high complexity and barely acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a genetic optimised serial hierarchical FRBS, which incorporates lateral tuning of membership functions and optimisation of the rule base. The serial hierarchical structure of FRBS allows selecting and ranking the input variables, which reduces the system complexity and distinguish the importance of attributes in datasets.

However, there is a dearth of studies in the literature on effective features ranking methods for classification purpose. Moreover, optimal number of features required for the classification task also needs to be evaluated. In this study, we investigate the impact of supervised and unsupervised feature selection techniques on machine learning methods for nodule classification in Computed Tomography (CT) images. The research work explores the classification performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine(SVM) when trained with 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 highly ranked features from supervised and unsupervised ranking approaches. The best classification results were achieved using SVM trained with 8 radiomic features selected from supervised feature ranking methods and the accuracy was 100%. The study further revealed that very good nodule classification can be achieved by training any of the SVM or Naive Bayes with a fewer radiomic features. A periodic increment in the number of radiomic features from 2 to 20 did not improve the classification results whether the selection was made using supervised or unsupervised ranking approaches.","Quantitative imaging features,radiomic features,nodule classification,machine learning,feature selection algorithms",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07098,

To overcome these limitations, we take inspiration from organic chemistry where full enumeration of neutral, closed-shell molecules under the constraint of size has enriched discovery efforts. We design monodentate and bidentate ligands from scratch for the construction of mononuclear, octahedral transition metal complexes with up to 13 heavy atoms (i.e., metal, C, N, O, P, or S). From >11 000 theoretical ligands, we develop a heuristic score for ranking a chemically feasible 2500 ligand subset, only 71 of which were previously included in common organic molecule databases. We characterize the top 20% of scored ligands with density functional theory (DFT) in an octahedral homoleptic ligand database (OHLDB). The OHLDB contains i) the geometry optimized structures of 1250 homoleptic octahedral complexes obtained from the enumerated pool of ligands and an open-shell transition metal (M(ii)/M(iii), M = Cr, Mn, Fe, or Co) and ii) the resulting high-spin/low-spin adiabatic electronic energy differences (Delta EH-L) obtained with hybrid DFT. Over the OHLDB, we observe structure-property (i.e., Delta EH-L) relationships different from those expected on the basis of ligand field arguments or from our prior data sets. Finally, we demonstrate how incorporating OHLDB data into artificial neural network (ANN) training improves ANN out-of-sample performance on much larger transition metal complexes.","ACTIVATED DELAYED FLUORESCENCE,TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,MOLECULAR-MECHANICS,CATALYST DESIGN,FORCE-FIELD,LIGAND,DATABASE,BEHAVIOR,SPECTRA",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,4.667,"ACTIVATED,DELAYED,FLUORESCENCE,TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,MOLECULAR-MECHANICS,CATALYST,DESIGN,FORCE-FIELD,LIGAND,DATABASE,BEHAVIOR,SPECTRA",MOLECULAR SYSTEMS DESIGN & ENGINEERING,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/124876/1/c9me00069k.pdf,

ICs are made by creating circuit structures on a wafer made out of very pure semiconducting material, typically silicon, and interconnecting the structures using wires. In order to produce high density IC, the wafer surface must be extremely clean and the circuit layers fabricated on the previous wafer should be aligned. If these conditions are not satisfied, the high density structure may collapse.
To prevent this from happening, the wafers must be constantly cleaned to avoid contamination, and to remove the left-over of the previous process steps. Then, automatic defect classification (ADC) is used to identify and classify wafer surface defects using scanning electron microscope images. However, the classification performance of current ADC systems is poor. If the defects could be classified correctly, then the root of the fabrication problem can be recognized and eventually resolved.
Machine learning techniques have been widely accepted and are well suited for such classification problems. In this paper, we propose double feature extraction method based on convolution neural network. The proposed model uses the Radon transform for the first feature extraction, and then input this feature into the convolution layer for the second feature extraction. Experiments with real-world data set verified that the proposed method achieves high defect classification performance, defect pattern recognition accuracy up to 98.5%, and we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction technique.","ADC,Deep Learning,Defect,Wafer Map",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,PATTERN,,,

A first one is the need for a high level of technical expertise in the manufacturing process of focus: this is essential to define the meaningful dataset that represents comprehensively the desired output of the process. Another component is the data collection aspect: many data have to be collected, stored and parsed, and some small signals found will become the leading indicator to an upcoming process degradation and capability of capturing them is essential. Another key data is traceability of the processed material. Additionally, ensuring an informatic technology architecture to support collection, storage, parsing and computation of the datasets is a significant challenge.

DR is detected by analysing the retinal background without segmenting the lesions. This work focuses on local ternary pattern (LTP) for analysing texture of the fundus image. As local binary pattern (LBP) is more sensitive to noise and illumination variation, LTP is employed and its discriminative power is explored. LTP is obtained for all three colour components, red (R), green (G) and blue (B) for different radius considering eight neighbours. The histogram of LTP and variance form a feature set for the classifiers KNN and random forest with ten-fold cross validation. Random forest provides a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The average sensitivity and specificity of nearly 91% are achieved. The proposed algorithm is very fast and can be used as a screening test for retinal abnormalities detection.","local ternary pattern,LTP,local binary pattern,LBP,random forest,computer aided diagnosis,fundus images,K-nearest neighbourhood,KNN,diabetic retinopathy",Article,"INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD, WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,,"TEXTURE,CLASSIFICATION,GLOBAL,PREVALENCE,RISK-FACTORS,MICROANEURYSMS,DIAGNOSIS,RETRIEVAL,FEATURES,LESIONS,SYSTEM",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,,

The sentences unrelated to food nutrition matching can be filtered. Then, the two food verb-noun joint probability matrices can be constructed. By comparing row mean value of the two matrices, whether the verb is a trigger word can be judged.

Applicability of these methods to large scale inverse problems is however limited by the available memory for training and extensive training times, the latter due to computationally expensive forward models. As a possible solution to these restrictions we propose a multi-scale learned iterative reconstruction scheme that computes iterates on discretisations of increasing resolution. This procedure does not only reduce memory requirements, it also considerably speeds up reconstruction and training times, but most importantly is scalable to large scale inverse problems with non-trivial forward operators, such as those that arise in many 3D tomographic applications. In particular, we propose a hybrid network that combines the multi-scale iterative approach with a particularly expressive network architecture which in combination exhibits excellent scalability in 3D. Applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated for 3D cone beam computed tomography from real measurement data of an organic phantom. Additionally, we examine scalability and reconstruction quality in comparison to established learned reconstruction methods in two dimensions for low dose computed tomography on human phantoms.","Model-based learning,iterative reconstruction,cone beam computed tomography,deep learning,inverse problems",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,5.107,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00936,

CS-MRI presents two fundamental problems: (1) where to sample and (2) how to reconstruct an under-sampled scan. In this article, we tackle both problems simultaneously for the specific case of 2D Cartesian sampling, using a novel end-to-end learning framework that we call LOUPE (Learning-based Optimization of the Under-sampling PattErn). Our method trains a neural network model on a set of full-resolution MRI scans, which are retrospectively under-sampled on a 2D Cartesian grid and forwarded to an anti-aliasing (a.k.a. reconstruction) model that computes a reconstruction, which is in turn compared with the input. This formulation enables a data-driven optimized under-sampling pattern at a given sparsity level. In our experiments, we demonstrate that LOUPE-optimized under-sampling masks are data-dependent, varying significantly with the imaged anatomy, and perform well with different reconstruction methods. We present empirical results obtained with a large-scale, publicly available knee MRI dataset, where LOUPE offered superior reconstruction quality across different conditions. Even with an aggressive 8-fold acceleration rate, LOUPE's reconstructions contained much of the anatomical detail that was missed by alternative masks and reconstruction methods.

These neural networks are usually trained in a supervised manner, so matched pairs of subsampled, and fully sampled k-space data are required. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to acquire matched fully sampled k-space data, since the acquisition of fully sampled k-space data requires long scan time, and often leads to the change of the acquisition protocol. Therefore, unpaired deep learning without matched label data has become a very important research topic. In this article, we propose an unpaired deep learning approach using a optimal transport driven cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (OT-cycleGAN) that employs a single pair of generator, and discriminator. The proposed OT-cycleGAN architecture is rigorously derived from a dual formulation of the optimal transport formulation using a specially designed penalized least squares cost.

Our network has three cascaded blocks, where the first block is used to denoise and interpolate the sinograms, the second to map the sinograms to CT images and the last to denoise the CT images. The second block of our network implements the filter backprojection (FBP) algorithm or the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, where the filter step is implemented by a one-dimensional convolution layer and the backprojection is implemented by a sparse matrix multiplication. By incorporating the FBP/FDK algorithm into our network, training a fully connected layer to convert the sinograms to CT images is avoided and the number of weights of our network is decreased. Our network is trained with two labels, the sinograms and CT images, and can reconstruct good CT images even if the input sinograms are very sparse.

The algorithm processes signals collected from pairs of antennas that are positioned symmetrically around the head, discretizes the imaging domain into pixels, and computes the statistical fields between the antennas on the left and right sides of the head. Then, it concatenates their intensities along the axis normal to the imaging domain to compute the expected value for every pixel. The computed expected values are merged into a matrix containing expected values for all pixels. Pixels with higher intensity show the likelihood of an anomaly being present at that location. The assumption on brain symmetry from the electromagnetic perspective was tested on healthy volunteers using a 14-element array system with a working frequency band of 0.5 - 2.0 GHz.

It has been reported that FDG PET imaging provides prognostic information for both baseline and therapeutic follow-up of MM patients using visual analysis. In this study, we aim to develop a computer-assisted method based on PET quantitative image features to assist diagnoses and treatment decisions for MM patients. Methods Our proposed model relies on a two-stage method with Random Survival Forest (RFS) and variable importance (VIMP) for both feature selection and prediction. The targeted variable for prediction is the progression-free survival (PFS). We consider texture-based (radiomics), conventional (e.g., SUVmax) and clinical biomarkers. We evaluate PFS predictions in terms of C-index and final prognosis separation in two risk groups, from a database of 66 patients who were part of the prospective multi-centric french IMAJEM study. Results Our method (VIMP + RSF) provides better results (1-C-index of 0.36) than conventional methods such as Lasso-Cox and gradient-boosting Cox (0.48 and 0.56, respectively). We experimentally proved the interest of using selection (0.61 for RSF without selection) and showed that VIMP selection is more stable and gives better results than minimal depth and variable hunting (0.47 and 0.43). The approach gives better prognosis group separation (a p value of 0.05 against 0.11 to 0.4 for others). Conclusion Our results confirm the predictive value of radiomics for MM patients, in particular, they demonstrate that quantitative/heterogeneity image-based features reduce the error of the predicted progression. To our knowledge, this is the first work using RFS on PET images for the progression prediction of MM patients. Moreover, we provide an analysis of the feature selection process, which points toward the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers.","Random survival forest,Multiple myeloma,Variable selection,Radiomics,PET imaging",Review,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"VARIABLE,SELECTION,TEXTURAL,FEATURES,FDG,PET%2FCT",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02172435/document,

Early detection and early treatment can reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies have shown that breast cancer microcalcifications is one of the important clinical manifestations of early breast cancer, and sometimes even the only manifestation. When the mammography image shows typical malignant microcalcification, it can be diagnosed as breast cancer without any other signs of malignancy. In the aided diagnosis of microcalcifications, it is a crucial step to automatically find and locate regions of interest containing microcalcifications. However, the existing feature extraction method for microcalcifications only extracts features in the time domain or wavelet domain, and does not completely represent all the information of the region of interest. An extraction method based on the combination of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) and texture features is proposed in the paper.
METHODS: First, the processing operations including denoising, enhancement, and edge detection were performed on mammograms. Sub-image segmentation is then performed. DTCWT features and texture features are extracted for each sub-image.DTCWT features are combined with texture features, and then genetic algorithm is used for feature optimization. The features are classified by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to achieve rapid detection and automatic extraction of ROI with microcalcifications. The experimental results verify that the feature model proposed in this paper has the highest detection rate for ROI regions. The ROI region extracted by the proposed feature model was used as subsequent experimental data. Three different methods were used to detect the microcalcifications, including Top-hat, wavelet transform, and methods combining Top-Hat and wavelet transform.
RESULTS: The method was applied to 100 mammograms from the mammograms database of women in Northeast China. In the automatic extraction of ROI, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive accuracy and negative accuracy of the proposed model combined with DTCWT were 95.92%, 96.71%, 92.20%, 93.65%, 96.33%, respectively. When the Top-hat algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity reached 89.6%, and the false positive detection rate was 2.6. When the wavelet transform algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 91.1%, and the false positive detection rate was 3.28. When the combined algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 86.7%, and the false positive detection rate decreased to 1.35.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model combined with DTCWT features achieves better result in the automatic extraction of ROI. Moreover, in the subsequent detection of microcalcifications based on three methods, the three methods achieved better results in sensitivity and false positive detection rate, respectively.","Breast Cancer,Microcalcifications,DTCWT,ELM,Mammogram",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,1.159,"EXTREME,LEARNING-MACHINE,CLUSTERED,MICROCALCIFICATIONS,AUTOMATIC,DETECTION,CANCER,STATISTICS,CALCIFICATIONS,CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEM",JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,,

The system is cost-effective, single-channeled, and time-frequency scalp-EEG signals-based. In this study, the Bitalino EEG sensor board is used to record EEG signals from 30 human subjects in different attention states. Initially, the attention level was classified into three categories, which are focused, neutral and distracted. The data was taken while the subjects were watching interesting videos and boring lectures, doing simple and interesting math problems, and solving interesting and hard puzzles. At first, these EEG signals are pre-processed to remove noise such as muscle movement. Statistical coefficients (i.e. mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy) and statistical wavelet transform are used to extract meaningful features from the EEG signal. We mainly used two multi-scale wavelet packet statistics (WPS) and multi-scale wavelet packet energy statistics (WPES) to generate the feature vector.

Это время в свою очередь состоит из интервала времени собственно разрушения камня и времени, затрачиваемого на дополнительные действия: осмотр места дробления, перемещение лазерного волокна к смещенному в результате ретропульсии камню, промывания области дробления и проч. В настоящее время отсутствуют методы расчета или прогнозирования этих интервалов времени. Цель: разработать способ прогнозирования времени разрушения мочевых камней с учетом дополнительных затратвремени при использовании контактной литотрипсии гольмиевым лазером, чтобы на основе знания времени операции рационально выстраивать тактику лечения, планировать варианты операционного пособия и загрузку операционного помещения и высокотехнологического оборудования.Материалы и методы. В работе приведены собственные результаты измерений in vivo интервалов времени, зарачиваемых на собственно разрушение мочевого камня и на вспомогательные действия, необходимые при проведении трансуретральной контактной литотрипсии, а также общее время полного разрушения конкремента. Дробление камней осуществлялось с помощью полуригидного и гибкого уретероскопов в мочеточнике и чашечно-лоханочной системе. В ряде случаев прибегали к перкутанному минидренированию ЧЛС. Использованы методы статистической обработки данных и пакет Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox системы Матлаб для прогнозирования длительности процедуры разрушения конкрементов гольмиевым литотриптером Triple («Медоптотех»). Результаты. Для прогнозирования общего времени, затрачиваемого на дробление мочевого камня предложена линейная регрессионная модель, в которой общее время представлено в виде суммы времени, затрачиваемого на собственно процесс дробления, и времени дополнительных затрат на выполнение вспомогательных манипуляций. К вспомогательным действиям относятся: промывание области дробления, репозиционирование оптического волокна по причине смещения его из-за ретропульсии камня и дыхательной экскурсии и проч. Время непосредственного дробления камня определяется на основе массы камня, рассчитанной по измеренным при КТ объеме и плотности, а также удельной скорости потери массы камня при дроблении гольмиевым лазером, энергии и частоты импульсов лазерного литотриптера. Время дополнительных затрат представлено в виде произведения времени непосредственного дробления камня на коэффициент дополнительных затрат. Путем измерений in vivo и статистической обработки данных получены средние и максимально допустимые значения коэффициентов дополнительных затрат при дроблении в различных частях мочевыделительной системы. Средние значения этих коэффициентов составляют: 5,44±2,42 при дроблении камней в ЧЛС полуригидным уретероскопом; 3,86±1,95 при использовании гибкого УРС; 8,92±3,13 при дроблении камней в различных отделах мочеточника и 1,36±0,62 при использовании методики mini drainage. Заключение. Получены данные экспериментальных исследований длительностей дробления мочевых конкрементов и интервалов времени дополнительных затрат на проведение вспомогательных манипуляций, выполняемых наряду с процедурой собственно дробления камней, а также предложен способ дополнительного промывания полости дробления, позволяющий сократить время дополнительных затрат при дроблении не менее, чем в 4 раза. Разработана математическая модель для вычисления продолжительности общих затрат на дробление, позволяющая более точно прогнозировать длительность операции контактной литотрипсии гольмиевым лазером в целом.",контактная литотрипсия; гольмиевый лазер; мочевые камни; МКБ; дополнительное промывание; прогнозирование длительности литотрипсии,Article,,,,,,,,

The network architectures examined included ResNet34 and DenseNet121. Image resolutions ranging from 32 * 32 to 600 * 600 pixels were investigated. Network training paradigms used 80% of samples for training and 20% for validation. CNN performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and label accuracy. Binary output networks were trained separately for each label or diagnosis under consideration.Results: Maximum AUCs were achieved at image resolutions between 256 * 256 and 448 * 448 pixels for binary decision networks targeting emphysema, cardiomegaly, hernias, edema, effusions, atelectasis, masses, and nodules. When comparing performance between networks that utilize lower resolution (64 * 64 pixels) versus higher (320 * 320 pixels) resolution inputs, emphysema, cardiomegaly, hernia, and pulmonary nodule detection had the highest fractional improvements in AUC at higher image resolutions.

This paper proposes a novel effective three-level convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to automate the selection of abdominal computed tomography (CT) images on large-scale CT scans and automatically quantify the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. First, the proposed framework employs support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a configured parameter to cluster abdominal CT images from screening patients. Second, a pyramid dilation network (DilaLab) is designed based on CNN, to address the complex distribution and non-abdominal internal adipose tissue problems of biomedical image segmentation in visceral adipose tissue. Finally, since the trained DilaLab implicitly encodes the fat-related learning, the transferred DilaLab learning and a simple decoder constitute a new network (DilaLabPlus) for quantifying subcutaneous adipose tissue. The networks are trained not only all available CT images but also with a limited number of CT scans, such as 70 samples including a 10% validation subset. All networks are yielding more precise results. The mean accuracy of the configured SVM classifier yields promising performance of 99.83%, while DilaLabPlus achieves a remarkable performance improvement an with average of 98.08 +/- 0.84% standard deviation and 0.7 +/- 0.8% standard deviation false-positive rate.

In this work, we apply a mixture of predictive, e.g., classification methods and attribute-selection techniques, and traditional explanatory, e.g., statistical, analyses on functional connectivity measures extracted from EEG signal acquired from at-rest participants (N = 52) during their interictal period and tested them against the distinction between MWA and MWoA. We show that a functional connectivity metric of EEG data obtained during resting state can serve as a sole biomarker to differentiate between MWA and MWoA. Using the proposed analysis, we not only have been able to present high classification results (average classification of 84.62%) but also to discuss the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms upon which our technique is based. Additionally, a more traditional statistical analysis on the selected features reveals that MWoA patients show higher than average connectivity in the Theta band (p = 0.03) at rest than MWAs.

The proposed work utilizes a deep supervised learning method, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture achieving a classification accuracy of 95%. The classification capability of the new CNN model is compared with a pre-trained AlexNet model, a visual geometry group (VGG)-16 deep architecture and a conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network. The results show that the constructed model can achieve better classification accuracy than VGG-16 (94%) and MLP (90.3%), while AlexNet emerges as the most efficient classifier (97%).","liver biopsies,fatty liver,hepatocyte ballooning,deep learning,convolutional neural networks,computer vision",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"DISEASE,QUANTIFICATION,CLASSIFICATION,STEATOSIS,BIOPSIES,FAT",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/1/42/pdf,

The technique of capturing CO2 from higher CO2 concentrations, such as power plants, has been widely studied, but capturing lower concentrations of CO2 directly from the air remains a challenge. This study uses high-throughput computer (Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation) and machine learning (ML) to study 6013 computation-ready, experimental metal-organic frameworks (CoRE-MOFs) for CO2 adsorption and diffusion properties in the air with very low concentrations of CO2. First, the law influencing CO2 adsorption and diffusion in air is obtained as a structure-performance relationship, and then the law influencing the performance of CO2 adsorption and diffusion in air is further explored by four ML algorithms. Random forest (RF) was considered the optimal algorithm for prediction of CO2 selectivity, with an R value of 0.981, and this algorithm was further applied to analyze the relative importance of each metal-organic framework (MOF) descriptor quantitatively. Finally, 14 MOFs with the best properties were successfully screened out, and it was found that a key to capturing a low concentration CO2 from the air was the diffusion performance of CO2 in MOFs. When the pore-limiting diameter (PLD) of a MOF was closer to the CO2 dynamic diameter, this MOF could possess higher CO2 diffusion separation selectivity. This study could provide valuable guidance for the synthesis of new MOFs in experiments that capture directly low concentration CO2 from the air.","CO2 capture,Monte Carlo,machine learning,metal-organic framework,adsorption,diffusion",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"STRUCTURE-PROPERTY,RELATIONSHIPS,CARBON-DIOXIDE,SEPARATION,ADSORPTION,PERFORMANCE,HYDROGEN,STORAGE,POROUS,MATERIALS,COORDINATION,MIXTURES,BIOCHAR,DESIGN",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/2/569/pdf,

Integration of Conditional Random Fields into Convolutional Neural Networks as a hybrid end-to-end approach for prostate cancer detection on non-contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Abstract Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common oncological disease in Western men. Even though a growing effort has been carried out by the scientific community in recent years, accurate and reliable automated PCa detection methods on multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) are still a compelling issue. In this work, a Deep Neural Network architecture is developed for the task of classifying clinically significant PCa on non-contrast-enhanced MR images. In particular, we propose the use of Conditional Random Fields as a Recurrent Neural Network (CRF-RNN) to enhance the classification performance of XmasNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture specifically tailored to the PROSTATEx17 Challenge. The devised approach builds a hybrid end-to-end trainable network, CRF-XmasNet, composed of an initial CNN component performing feature extraction and a CRF-based probabilistic graphical model component for structured prediction, without the need for two separate training procedures. Experimental results show the suitability of this method in terms of classification accuracy and training time, even though the high-variability of the observed results must be reduced before transferring the resulting architecture to a clinical environment. Interestingly, the use of CRFs as a separate postprocessing method achieves significantly lower performance with respect to the proposed hybrid end-to-end approach. The proposed hybrid end-to-end CRF-RNN approach yields excellent peak performance for all the CNN architectures taken into account, but it shows a high-variability, thus requiring future investigation on the integration of CRFs into a CNN.","prostate cancer detection,magnetic resonance imaging,convolutional neural networks,conditional random fields,recurrent neural networks",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED,MRI,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SEGMENTATION,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHMS",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/310433/3/applsci-10-00338-v2.pdf,

The 405 beach placer borehole samples were collected from Southern Suoi Nhum deposit, Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, to test the feasibility of these soft computing techniques in estimating ilmenite content. Heavy mineral analysis indicated that valuable minerals in the placer sand are zircon, ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, anatase, and monazite. In this study, five materials, namely rutile, anatase, leucoxene, zircon, and monazite, were used as the input variables to estimate ilmenite content based on the above mentioned soft computing models. Of the whole dataset, 325 samples were used to build the regarded soft computing models; 80 remaining samples were used for the models' verification. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-2), a simple ranking method, and residuals analysis technique were used as the statistical criteria for assessing the model performances. The numerical experiments revealed that soft computing techniques are capable of estimating the content of ilmenite with high accuracy.

For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing (GP) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other AutoML systems, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data.
Results We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector (FSS) and Template. FSS provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. FSS increases TPOT's efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing GP to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed GP and enables the incorporation of FSS at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, FSS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-FSS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-FSS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, TPOT-FSS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.

Existing approaches involve physical models, which are non-linear in nature and lead to classifiers that do not generalize well, e.g. across different types of tissue preparation. Furthermore, existing preprocessing approaches involve iterative procedures that are computationally demanding, so that computation time required for preprocessing does not keep pace with recent progress in infrared microscopes which can capture whole-slide images within minutes.
Results We investigate the application of stacked contractive autoencoders as an unsupervised approach to preprocess infrared microscopic pixel spectra, followed by supervised fine-tuning to obtain neural networks that can reliably resolve tissue structure. To validate the robustness of the resulting classifier, we demonstrate that a network trained on embedded tissue can be transferred to classify fresh frozen tissue. The features obtained from unsupervised pretraining thus generalize across the large spectral differences between embedded and fresh frozen tissue, where under previous approaches separate classifiers had to be trained from scratch.

Detecting the boundaries from different nodule structures is crucial due to the presence of similar visualization characteristics between the nodules and its surroundings. The study proposed an approach for pulmonary nodule region of interest (NROI) detection and segmentation using Computed Tomography (CT) lung images. Lung nodule CT images are acquired from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) public repository having 1018 cases. In this paper, a methodology for automated tumor grading of pulmonary lung nodules is proposed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The salient features of benign and malignant nodules from different nodule structures are automatically self-learned and classified based on the classification strategy. The stages involved in the methodology are: 1) Pre-processing the image datasets using discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). 2) NROI segmentation. 3) NROI Feature extraction using CNN. 4) Nodule classification. CNN are trained with self-learned extracted features from NROI and are further classified as benign or malignant. Analyzing and segregating these extracted features plays a vital role in the correct classification of malignancy levels. The methodology is compared with conventional state-of-art methods and traditional hand-crafted methods. A total of 710 pulmonary nodules are used in the study, with 258 benign samples and 452 malignant samples. A consistent behavior was observed using CNN with reduced low false positives and a classification accuracy of 96.5%, sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 96.55% and standard Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the highest value of 0.969 was recorded.","Lung cancer,computed tomography (CT),pulmonary nodules,segmentation,feature extraction,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),discrete wavelet transform (DWT)",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,,"CANCER,SEGMENTATION,ALGORITHMS,DIAGNOSIS",INTELLIGENT DECISION TECHNOLOGIES-NETHERLANDS,,

We used an AlexNet trained with natural images for the deep convolutional neural network and a support vector machine for classification. Synthetic computed tomography images with circular and rectangular signal bodies at different levels of contrast and added Gaussian noise were used for training and testing.
RESULTS: Two transfer learning methods were tested: classification by a re-trained support vector machine using the AlexNet features, and a method that fine-tuned the deep convolutional neural network. Using the first method, all the test image noise levels could be classified correctly. The fine-tuning method achieved an accuracy rate of 92.6%.

The framework is divided into two parts: knowledge modeling and knowledge reasoning. In the first step of knowledge modeling, 3D-CNN is utilized to model the spatiotemporal information from the facial and forehead regions based on the remote photoplethysmography technique, separating the blood volume pulse (BVP) signal and extracting the HR from the forehead image sequence. Finally, the multichannel features are integrated and transformed into structured data and put into the knowledge graph as much as possible. Knowledge reasoning is an inferential process that associates the deep learning model with structured knowledge to predict continuous values of the emotional dimensions (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) from facial videos of subjects. Experiments conducted on the DEAP database demonstrate that this approach leads to improved emotion recognition performance and significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art proposals. The result proved that prior knowledge from the knowledge graph ground truth on deep learning is an efficient means of emotional recognition in vision modality. Our artificial intelligence models can be popularized and applied in daily healthcare.","Emotion Recognition,Multi-channel,Knowledge Graph,3D-CNN,the PAD model,Remote Photoplethysmography",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Computer Science,,,,11TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (ICKG 2020),,
97,Machine Learning Based Spam E-mail Detection System for Turkish,,,7-12,"Eryilmaz Ersin Enes,Sahin Durmus Ozkan,Kilic Erdal","Eryilmaz EE,Sahin DO,Kilic E",Eryilmaz EE,,Ondokuz Mayis University,"Electronic mail is a digital letter sent over the internet. All types of files such as documents, pictures, music, videos can be attached to emails and transferred to the recipient's computer. E-mails, which are preferred due to their cheapness and ease, are sent to billions of people every year. Email is an effective way of communication as it saves time and money, hence it has become the most used communication tool in personal and professional communication. Emails are actively used by people or communities who want to make propaganda, advertising, phishing because of their ease of use and low cost. People or communities who want to achieve their goals send unnecessary and unsolicited mail to the e-mail accounts they never knew. These mails cause serious material and moral damages to Internet users and also weaken Internet traffic. Spam e-mail is a method that is sent to the recipient without his consent and that is generally used by malicious or promotional purposes. The purpose of spammers is to encourage computer users to purchase legal or prohibited products and services. Existing spam blocking methods often lag behind innovations that spammers constantly bring, so machine learning-based spam detection methods emerge. In this study, it is provided to detect spam by using 7 different machine learning methods on 800 Turkish e-mail datasets. In the developed method, when the feature selection is made with the chi-square test, the best result is obtained from the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. When the feature selection is made with the information gain method, the best result is obtained from the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. Performance results obtained from SMO and MLP algorithms are 0.985 and 0.984 according to F-measure, respectively.","e-mail classification,spam filtering,machine learning,Turkish e-mail classification,Turkish spam filtering",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,

These signals are commonly used to detect epileptic seizures. The aim of this study is to classify healthy and epileptic individual EEG signals using artificial neural networks (ANN). For this purpose, the open data source of the University of Bonn was used. The success rates of the classification results obtained with the designed ANN model show the effectiveness of this ANN structure in the application under consideration.","EEG Signal,Artificial Neural Networks,Wavelet Transform",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"WAVELET,SEIZURE",2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,
99,Application of Deep Learning Based Object Detection on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,,,74-78,"Ipek Burak,Akpinar Mustafa","Ipek B,Akpinar M",Ipek B,,Sakarya University,"Object recognition can be seen in every field thanks to today's high computation power. It has become possible to extract information from the images with high accuracy in different areas such as human, animal, vehicle, traffic signs and MR images. In this study, plastic water bottle detection was applied by using Inception v2, MobileNet v2 and ResNet50 architectures to be used in the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAIC) International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Competition. Cloud based training applied to locate very small objects from up to 5 meters high. In the present study, the Single Shot Detector (SSD) ResNet50 model yielded the best results for mAP@1.75 and final loss. It was also determined that SSD Inception v2 model gave better results than SSD MobileNet v2 model. When the processing times were considered, it was determined that models could not work at Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ equipment at sufficient speed. However, these results have shown that the Jetson Nano card can be operated correctly on a drone. In the next stage of this study, the aim will be determining environmental pollution level by detecting objects such as plastic bags, bottles and fruits on the streets.","convolutional neural networks,motion detection,neural net architecture",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,
100,Anomaly Detection on EtherCAT Based Water Level Control Automation,,,79-82,"Akpinar Kevser Ovaz,Ozcelik Ibrahim","Akpinar KO,Ozcelik I",Ozcelik I,,Sakarya University,"Cyber attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are considered to be an extremely dangerous threat as they lead material losses or undermine a process. These attacks are mostly targeted to the field level of the critical systems. EtherCAT, one of the most preferred hard real-time protocol in Europe is also open to both known and zero-day attacks. In this work, EtherCAT based anomaly detection is studied applying machine learning methods. To do this, first, a water level control testbed is developed in laboratory scale. Attack vectors are created, and a dataset is formed considering EtherCAT communication principles. Secondly, attributes related to the running-process are selected and reduced. Finally, anomalies are detected both for supervised and unsupervised methods and an evaluation of the methods are done. Results showed that, SVM and Random Forest can be used for EtherCAT anomaly detection as supervised methods. It is also observed that each algorithm applied in unsupervised learning is successful in detecting a specific attack trace.","anomaly detection,EtherCAT,SCADA,cyber security",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,,2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (UBMK),,
