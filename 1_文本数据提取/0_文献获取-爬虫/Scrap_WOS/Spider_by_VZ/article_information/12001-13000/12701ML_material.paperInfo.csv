1,EEG- based Recognition of Driver State Related to Situation Awareness Using Graph Convolutional Networks,,,180-187,"Li Ruilin,Lan Zirui,Cui Jian,Sourina Olga,Wang Lipo","Li RL,Lan ZR,Cui J,Sourina O,Wang LP",Li RL,10.1109/CW49994.2020.00037,"Fraunhofer Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.","Extracting intra- and inter-subject parameters from Electroencephalogram (EEG) representing different Situation Awareness (SA) status is a critical challenge for objective SA recognition. Most of the existing work focuses on the subject-dependent classification that applies power spectrum density (PSD) features. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral-spatial (S-S) model for cross-subject fatigue-related SA recognition. The S-S model not only considers the biological topology across different brain regions to capture both local and global relations among different EEG channels, but also extracts spectral features for each EEG channel. Specifically, we firstly model the topological structure of EEG channels via an adjacency matrix which is built based on the Euclidean distance between EEG channels. Then, the graph convolution operation is employed to perform the neighbourhood aggregation for extracting spatial features. We test our model on a public dataset collected during driver's task performance. The subject-independent performance of the model is explored. Results demonstrate (1) the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art models on SA recognition from EEG signals. Specifically, our S-S model achieves 70.6% accuracy which is higher than traditional machine learning methods by 2.7%-6.8% and deep learning methods by 10.3%-11.6%; (2) EEG signal at the occipital region can better reflect the change of SA.","Situation awareness recognition,Graph Convolution Networks,EEG",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,NEURAL-NETWORKS,2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERWORLDS (CW 2020),,

This study evaluates and compares the impacts of two statistical and two machine learning imputation techniques when classifying breast cancer patients, using several evaluation metrics. Mean, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were applied to impute 18% of missing data missed completely at random in the two Wisconsin datasets. Thereafter, we empirically evaluated these four imputation techniques when using five classifiers: decision tree (C4.5), Case Based Reasoning (CBR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). In total, 1380 experiments were conducted and the findings confirmed that classification using imputation based machine learning outperformed classification using statistical imputation.

WMLs, which have extensively been associated with gait impairment, justify further investigation of its implication in FD. This study aims to identify a set of gait characteristics to discriminate FD patients with/without WMLs and healthy controls. Seventy-six subjects walked through a predefined circuit using gait sensors that continuously acquired different stride features. Data were normalized using multiple regression normalization taking into account the subject physical properties, with the assessment of 32 kinematic gait variables. A filter method (Mann Whitney U test and Pearson correlation) followed by a wrapper method (recursive feature elimination (RFE) for Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and information gain for Random Forest (RF)) were used for feature selection. Then, five different classifiers (LR, SVM Linear and RBF kernel, RF, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) based on different selected set features were evaluated. For FD patients with WMLs versus controls the highest accuracy of 72% was obtained using LR based on 3 gait variables: pushing, foot flat, and maximum toe clearance 2. For FD patients without WMLs versus controls, the best performance was observed using LR and SVM RBF kernel based on loading, foot flat, minimum toe clearance, stride length variability, loading variability, and lift-off angle variability with an accuracy of 83%. These findings are the first step to demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques based on gait variables as a complementary tool to understand the role of WMLs in the gait impairment of FD.","Fabry Disease,Feature selection,Machine learning,Gait",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Mathematics",,,"PARKINSONS-DISEASE,CLASSIFICATION,PERFORMANCE",,,

The structural-asymmetricity induces large axial force which causes axial vibration and shaft system damage. In this study, impeller forces are analyzed and optimized based on numerical simulation and experiment. Balance holes and a balance plate are used in cooperation. Orthogonal experiment is conducted to analyze the effects of balance hole diameter, sealing clearance width on the hub, and balance plate clearance width on axial force at design condition. Then, BP-artificial neural network is established with Global Dynamic Criterion algorithm. Efficiency and axial force at design condition are chosen as optimization objectives. The results prove that optimized pump has lower axial force and higher efficiency at design condition. The head coefficient meets design requirement. Accordingly, a cooperative method named the 'Combining Hole-Plate Pressure Balancing Method', made by adding balance holes and installing a balance plate in the hub clearance chamber, is proposed. The method can effectively reduce axial force and improve the adverse effect of axial force on the pump without obvious influence on hydraulic performance. This study is significant as a means to reduce axial force, lessen damage to a shaft system, and improve operation stability.","Vaned mixed-flow pump,axial force,pressure balance,orthogonal experiment,artificial neural network",Article,"HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, DEPT CIVIL & STRUCTURAL ENG, HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA","Engineering,Mechanics",,5.839,"HYDRAULIC,PERFORMANCE,CENTRIFUGAL,PUMP,SIMULATION,TURBINE,SHAPE",ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19942060.2020.1749933?needAccess=true,

So, the automatic and earlier diabetic prediction system needs to be created for eliminating the serious factors in medical field. There are several earlier diabetic prediction system is created with the help of hybridized machine learning techniques but they are difficult to process the huge dimension of data as well as consume more time for predicting diabetic related features.

Yet fall prevention interventions are not often prescribed until after a fall has been reported to a healthcare provider. While still nascent, objective fall risk assessments could help in prescribing preventative interventions. To this end, retrospective fall status classification commonly serves as an intermediate step in developing prospective fall risk assessments. Previous research has identified measures of gait biomechanics that differ between PwMS who have fallen and those who have not, but these biomechanical indices have not yet been leveraged to detect PwMS who have fallen. Moreover, they require the use of laboratory-based measurement technologies, which prevent clinical deployment. Here we demonstrate that a bidirectional long short-term (BiLSTM) memory deep neural network was able to identify PwMS who have recently fallen with good performance (AUC of 0.88) based on accelerometer data recorded from two wearable sensors during a one-minute walking task. These results provide substantial improvements over machine learning models trained on spatiotemporal gait parameters (21% improvement in AUC), statistical features from the wearable sensor data (16%), and patient-reported (19%) and neurologist-administered (24%) measures in this sample. The success and simplicity (two wearable sensors, only one-minute of walking) of this approach indicates the promise of inexpensive wearable sensors for capturing fall risk in PwMS.","Machine learning,Pulse width modulation,Feature extraction,Wearable sensors,Data models,Legged locomotion,Wearables,fall risk,digital health,machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Medical Informatics",,6.018,"VARIABILITY,PEOPLE,BALANCE,MOBILITY,HISTORY",IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,,

Despite all the successes of deep learning, neural networks of significant depth could not ensure better performance compared to shallow architectures. The approach presented in the article employs this idea, making use of yet shallower, but productive architecture. The main idea of the proposed architecture is based on three points: full-dimension-long 'valid' convolutions, dense connections - combination of layer's input and output and layer reuse. Another aspect addressed in the paper is related to interpretable machine learning. Interpretability is extremely important in medicine, where decisions must be taken on the basis of solid arguments and clear reasons. Being shallow, the architecture could be used for feature selection by interpreting the layers' weights, which allows understanding of the knowledge about the data cumulated in the network's layers. The approach, based on a fuzzy measure, allows using Choquet integral to aggregate the knowledge generated in the layer weights and understanding which features (EEG electrodes) provide the most essential information. The approach allows lowering feature number from 64 to 14 with an insignificant drop of accuracy (less than a percentage point).","Motor imagery,Feature selection,Convolutional neural network,Reusable convolutions",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

Using several additional approximations, we make the resulting sophisticated inference architecture real-time capable.

Our results show that wavelet decomposition does not improve the rib suppression, ""skip connections"" modification outperforms baseline autoencoder approach with and without the usage of the wavelet decomposition, the residual models are trained faster than plain models and achieve higher validation scores.","Bone suppression,Bone shadow exclusion,Chest x-ray,Convolutional neural networks,Deep learning",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,NETWORKS,,,

Nowadays, for medical image classification, there are some methods based on machine learning, deep learning and transfer learning. However, these methods may be time-consuming and not suitable for small datasets. Based on these limitations, we propose a novel method which combines few-shot learning method and attention mechanism. Our method takes end-to-end learning to solve the problem of artificial feature extraction in machine learning and few-shot learning method is especially to fulfill small datasets tasks, which means it performs better than traditional deep learning. In addition, our method can make full use of spatial and channel information which enhances the representation of models. Furthermore, we adopt 1x1 convolution to enhance the interactions of cross channel information. Then we apply the model to the medical dataset Brain Tumor and compare it with the transfer learning method and Dual Path Network. Our method achieves an accuracy of 92.44%, which is better than the above methods.","Medical image classification,Few-shot learning,Attention mechanism,Transfer learning",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

The premise of training an efficient deep learning model is to have a large number of medical images with annotations. Most medical images are scattered in hospitals or research institutions, and professionals such as doctors always don't have enough time to label the images. Besides, due to the constraints of privacy protection regulations like GDPR, sharing data directly between multiple institutions is prohibited. To solve the obstacles above, we propose an efficient federated learning model SU-Net for brain tumor segmentation. We introduce inception module and dense block into standard U-Net to comprise our SU-Net with multi-scale receptive fields and information reusing. We conduct experiments on the LGG (Low-Grade Glioma) Segmentation dataset ""Brain MRI Segmentation"" in Kaggle. The results show that, in non-federated scenario, SU-Net achieves a AUC (Area Under Curve which measures classification accuracy) of 99.7% and a DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient which measures segmentation accuracy) of 78.5%, which are remarkably higher than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model DeepLabv3+ and the classical model U-Net dedicated to semantic segmentation of medical images.

The typical training strategy is to adjust their input-output behavior so that it matches that of the biological circuit of interest. Even though this strategy ensures that the biological and artificial networks perform the same computational task, it does not guarantee that their internal activity dynamics match. This suggests that the trained RNNs might end up performing the task employing a different internal computational mechanism. In this work, we introduce a novel training strategy that allows learning not only the input-output behavior of an RNN but also its internal network dynamics. We test the proposed method by training an RNN to simultaneously reproduce internal dynamics and output signals of a physiologically-inspired neural model of motor cortical and muscle activity dynamics. Remarkably, we show that the reproduction of the internal dynamics is successful even when the training algorithm relies on the activities of a small subset of neurons sampled from the biological network. Furthermore, we show that training the RNNs with this method significantly improves their generalization performance. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed method is suitable for building powerful functional RNN models, which automatically capture important computational properties of the biological circuit of interest from sparse neural recordings.","Recurrent neural networks,Neural population dynamics,Full-FORCE learning,Motor control,Muscle synergies",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,"MOTOR,PRIMITIVES,GENERATION,MOVEMENTS",,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02211,

In the concerned problem, we predict whether there are surplus materials under a given group of production parameters. The dataset used in this work is from a real-world three-month steel coil production process. First, data cleaning is conducted to standardize the industrial dataset. Then, the production parameters highly correlated with surplus material prediction results are selected by a series of feature selection methods. Finally, two prediction models based on extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression are presented according to the selected features.

Specifically, MALDI-TOF-MS is applied on samples that usually include bacterial cells, generating representative signals for the various bacterial species. However, for a reliable identification result, a significant amount of biomass is required. For most samples used for diagnostics of infectious diseases, the sample volume is extremely low to obtain the required amount of biomass. Therefore, amplification of the bacterial load is performed by a culturing phase. If the MALDI process could be applied to individual bacteria, it would be possible to circumvent the need for culturing and isolation, accelerating the whole process. In this paper, we briefly describe an implementation of a MALDI-TOF MS procedure in a setting of individual cells and we demonstrate the use of the produced data for the application of pathogen identification. The identification of pathogens (bacterial species) is performed by using machine learning algorithms on the generated single-cell signals. The high predictive performance of the machine learning models indicates that the produced bacterial signatures constitute an informative representation, helpful in distinguishing the different bacterial species. In addition, we reformulate the bacterial species identification problem as a time series classification task by considering the intensity sequences of a given spectrum as time series values. Experimental results show that algorithms originally introduced for time series analysis are beneficial in modelling observations of single-cell MALDI-TOF MS.","MALDI-TOF MS,Single-cell spectrum,Single-ionization-event,Classification,Bacterial species identification,Time series",Proceedings Paper,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Computer Science,,,SPECTROMETRY,,,

Diagnosis of pneumonia by chest X-ray is one of the common methods used by medical experts. However, the image quality of chest X-Ray has some defects, such as low contrast, overlapping organs and blurred boundary, which seriously affects detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays. Therefore, it has important medical value and application significance to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia through a large number of chest X-ray images. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-Ray image: ACNN-RF, which is an adaptive median filter Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) recognition model based on Random forest (RF). Firstly, the improved adaptive median filtering is employed to remove noise in the chest X-ray image, which makes the image more easily recognized. Secondly, we establish the CNN architecture based on Dropout to extract deep activation features from each chest X-ray image. Finally, we employ the RF classifier based on GridSearchCV class as a classifier for deep activation features in CNN model. It not only avoids the phenomenon of over-fitting in data training, but also improves the accuracy of image classification. During our experiment, the public chest X-ray image dataset used in the experiment contains 5863 images, which comprises 4265 frontal-view X-ray images of 1574 unique patients.

Since the virus begun to spread, emergency departments were busy with COVID-19 patients for whom a quick decision regarding in- or outpatient care was required. The virus can cause characteristic abnormalities in chest radiographs (CXR), but, due to the low sensitivity of CXR, additional variables and criteria are needed to accurately predict risk. Here, we describe a computerized system primarily aimed at extracting the most relevant radiological, clinical, and laboratory variables for improving patient risk prediction, and secondarily at presenting an explainable machine learning system, which may provide simple decision criteria to be used by clinicians as a support for assessing patient risk. To achieve robust and reliable variable selection, Boruta and Random Forest (RF) are combined in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme to produce a variable importance estimate not biased by the presence of surrogates. The most important variables are then selected to train a RF classifier, whose rules may be extracted, simplified, and pruned to finally build an associative tree, particularly appealing for its simplicity. Results show that the radiological score automatically computed through a neural network is highly correlated with the score computed by radiologists, and that laboratory variables, together with the number of comorbidities, aid risk prediction. The prediction performance of our approach was compared to that that of generalized linear models and shown to be effective and robust.

So far, there are no effective therapeutic drugs or vaccines for COVID-19. The most serious complication of COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia called 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) with about 4.3% mortality rate. Comparing to chest Digital Radiography (DR), it is recently reported that chest Computed Tomography (CT) is more useful to serve as the early screening and diagnosis tool for NCIP. In this study, aimed to help physicians make the diagnostic decision, we develop a machine learning (ML) approach for automated diagnosis of NCIP on chest CT. Different from most ML approaches which often require training on thousands or millions of samples, we design a few-shot learning approach, in which we combine few-shot learning with weakly supervised model training, for computerized NCIP diagnosis. A total of 824 patients are retrospectively collected from two Hospitals with IRB approval. We first use 9 patients with clinically confirmed NCIP and 20 patients without known lung diseases for training a location detector which is a multitask deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) designed to output a probability of NCIP and the segmentation of targeted lesion area. An experienced radiologist manually localizes the potential locations of NCIPs on chest CTs of 9 COVID-19 patients and interactively segments the area of the NCIP lesions as the reference standard. Then, the multitask DCNN is furtherly fine-tuned by a weakly supervised learning scheme with 291 case-level labeled samples without lesion labels. A test set of 293 patients is independently collected for evaluation. With our NCIP-Net, the test AUC is 0.91. Our system has potential to serve as the NCIP screening and diagnosis tools for the fight of COVID-19S endemic and pandemic.","Lung,COVID-19,Training,Lesions,Hospitals,Computed tomography,COVID-19,chest CT,2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia,few-shot learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Telecommunications",,3.671,,IEEE ACCESS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09235500.pdf,

Existing deep learning approaches heavily rely on large labeled data sets, which are difficult to acquire in this pandemic situation. Therefore, weakly-supervised approaches are in demand. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection approach, ResNext+, that only requires volume level data labels and can provide slice level prediction. The proposed approach incorporates a lung segmentation mask as well as spatial and channel attention to extract spatial features. Besides, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized to acquire the axial dependency of the slices. Moreover, a slice attention module is applied before the final fully connected layer to generate the slice level prediction without additional supervision. An ablation study is conducted to show the efficiency of the attention blocks and the segmentation mask block.

In this article, we present a potential application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and physical distance monitoring for pandemic situations. The proposed framework consists of three parts: a lightweight and low-cost IoT node, a smartphone application (app), and fog-based Machine Learning (ML) tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks health parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display the user health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a physical distance of 2 m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling virus spread. In addition, a Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog server) considers the environmental risk and user health conditions to predict the risk of spreading infection in real time. The environmental risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides updated information for different places. Two scenarios are considered for the communication between the IoT node and fog server, 4G/5G/WiFi, or LoRa, which can be selected based on environmental constraints.

However, due to the heterogeneity of X-ray imaging and the difficulty of annotating infected regions precisely, learning automated infection segmentation on CXRs remains a challenging task. We propose a novel approach, called DRR4Covid, to learn COVID-19 infection segmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid consists of an infection-aware DRR generator, a segmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. Given a labeled Computed Tomography scan, the infection-aware DRR generator can produce infection-aware DRRs with pixel-level annotations of infected regions for training the segmentation network. The domain adaptation module is designed to enable the segmentation network trained on DRRs to generalize to CXRs. The statistical analyses made on experiment results have indicated that our infection-aware DRRs are significantly better than standard DRRs in learning COVID-19 infection segmentation (p < 0.05) and the domain adaptation module can improve the infection segmentation performance on CXRs significantly (p < 0.05). Without using any annotations of CXRs, our network has achieved a classification score of (Accuracy: 0.949, AUC: 0.987, F1-score: 0.947) and a segmentation score of (Accuracy: 0.956, AUC: 0.980, F1-score: 0.955) on a test set with 558 normal cases and 558 positive cases. Besides, by adjusting the strength of radiological signs of COVID-19 infection in infection-aware DRRs, we estimate the detection limit of X-ray imaging in detecting COVID-19 infection. The estimated detection limit, measured by the percent volume of the lung that is infected by COVID-19, is 19.43% +/- 16.29%, and the estimated lower bound of infected voxel contribution rate for significant radiological signs of COVID-19 infection is 20.0%.

Using deep learning methods to quickly identify COVID-19 and accurately segment the infected area can help control the outbreak and assist in treatment. Computed tomography (CT) as a fast and easy clinical method, it is suitable for assisting in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. According to clinical manifestations, COVID-19 lung infection areas can be divided into three categories: ground-glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates and consolidation. We proposed a multi-scale discriminative network (MSD-Net) for multi-class segmentation of COVID-19 lung infection on CT. In the MSD-Net, we proposed pyramid convolution block (PCB), channel attention block (CAB) and residual refinement block (RRB). The PCB can increase the receptive field by using different numbers and different sizes of kernels, which strengthened the ability to segment the infected areas of different sizes. The CAB was used to fusion the input of the two stages and focus features on the area to be segmented. The role of RRB was to refine the feature maps. Experimental results showed that the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the three infection categories were 0.7422,0.7384,0.8769 respectively.

To train our MIT Open Voice model we built a data collection pipeline of COVID-19 cough recordings through our website (opensigma.mit.edu) between April and May 2020 and created the largest audio COVID-19 cough balanced dataset reported to date with 5,320 subjects. Methods: We developed an AI speech processing framework that leverages acoustic biomarker feature extractors to pre-screen for COVID-19 from cough recordings, and provide a personalized patient saliency map to longitudinally monitor patients in real-time, non-invasively, and at essentially zero variable cost. Cough recordings are transformed with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and inputted into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture made up of one Poisson biomarker layer and 3 pre-trained ResNet50's in parallel, outputting a binary pre-screening diagnostic. Our CNN-based models have been trained on 4256 subjects and tested on the remaining 1064 subjects of our dataset. Transfer learning was used to learn biomarker features on larger datasets, previously successfully tested in our Lab on Alzheimer's, which significantly improves the COVID-19 discrimination accuracy of our architecture. Results: When validated with subjects diagnosed using an official test, the model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 98.5% with a specificity of 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). For asymptomatic subjects it achieves sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83.2%. Conclusions: AI techniques can produce a free, non-invasive, real-time, any-time, instantly distributable, largescale COVID-19 asymptomatic screening tool to augment current approaches in containing the spread of COVID-19. Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers, and public as schools, jobs, and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups.

Weed/crop detection and classification were performed through the Random Forest classifier.

Owing to their success in computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) or U-Net based models have often been employed in many recent studies for automatic tumor segmentation to learn numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels and extract various semantic features. However, the correlation between different tumor regions in feature maps cannot be easily captured due to the lack of contextual dependencies, which in turn limits the representative capability of the adopted models and thus affects the accuracy of tumor segmentation results. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework for segmentation of tumors in liver CT scans, which can explicitly extract multi-scale fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies. The proposed multi-scale framework features a light model with a very few additional parameters, and also its visualization capability significantly boosts networks' interpretability.

Recently, deep learning models have been increasingly applied to ECG classification. Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification. However, this methodology has two drawbacks. First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Second, beat-wise classification risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to achieving high classification performance. Addressing these drawbacks, we propose a novel deep learning model that can simultaneously conduct heartbeat segmentation and classification. Compared to existing methods, our model is more compact as it does not require explicit heartbeat segmentation. Moreover, our model is more context-aware, for it takes into account the relationship between heartbeats. To achieve simultaneous segmentation and classification, we present a Faster R-CNN based model that has been customized to handle ECG data. To characterize inter-heartbeat context information, we exploit inverted residual blocks and a novel feature fusion subroutine that combines average pooling with max-pooling.

Current state-of-the-art models for brain tissue segmentation and disease classification require multiple modalities for training and inference. However, the acquisition of all of these modalities are expensive, time-consuming, inconvenient and the required modalities are often not available. As a result, these datasets contain large amounts of unpaired data, where examples in the dataset do not contain all modalities. On the other hand, there is smaller fraction of examples that contain all modalities (paired data) and furthermore each modality is high dimensional when compared to number of datapoints. In this work, we develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in translating between two neuroimaging modalities. Our proposed model, Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN), uses an adversarial loss to learn from unpaired data points, cycle loss to enforce consistent reconstructions of the mappings and another adversarial loss to take advantage of paired data points.

This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S-type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S-type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types.

Moreover, the cognitive map is segmentwise continuous and preserves many of the major topological features of the latter. Therefore, neurons, trained using a Hebbian learning rule, can approximate the shape of any arbitrary manifold provided there are enough neurons to accomplish this. Moreover, the cognitive map can be readily used for clustering and visualization. Because of the above properties, SOMs are often used in big data pipelines. This conference paper focuses on a multilinear distance metric for the input vector space which adds flexibility in two ways. First, clustering can be extended to higher order data such as images, graphs, matrices, and time series. Second, the resulting clusters are unions of arbitrary shapes instead of fixed ones such as rectangles in case of l(1) norm or circles in case of l(2) norm. As a concrete example, the proposed distance metric is applied to an anonymized and open under the Creative Commons license cognitive multimodal dataset of fMRI images taken during three distinct cognitive tasks.

The technology for selecting informative features was proposed within the framework of the study. It consisted of three successive steps: 1) breaking a multiclass task into a series of binary tasks using the ""one vs all"" strategy; 2) screening of false-informative features is performed for each binary comparison by comparing the values of the median of the sets ""one"" and ""all""; 3) ranking of the remaining features according to their informative value and selection of the most informative ones for each binary comparison.
To assess the quality of the proposed technology for informative feature selection, we used the results obtained after application of classification based on the filtered data. Support vector method that proved itself in the problems of high-dimensional data classification was used as a classification model.
Results. Effectiveness of the proposed technology for informative feature selection was determined. This technology allows us to provide high quality of classification while significantly reducing the feature space. The number of features eliminated in the second step is approximately 50% for each data set under consideration, which greatly simplifies subsequent data analysis. After the third step, when the feature space is reduced to 15 features, the quality of classification by the macro-average F1-score metric is assessed as 98.9% for the GSE52581 dataset. For the GSE52581 dataset, with the feature space reduced to 266 features, the quality of classification by the macro-average F1-score metric is 91.3%.
Conclusion. The results of the work demonstrate the promising outlook of the proposed technology for informative feature selection as applied to the data of immunosignature analysis.","early diagnosis of diseases,immunosignature,feature selection in the sample,machine learning",Article,"NIZHNIY NOVGOROD STATE MEDICAL ACAD, MININ & POZHARSKY SQUARE, 10-1, NIZHNIY NOVGOROD, 603005, RUSSIA",Research & Experimental Medicine,,,DIAGNOSIS,SOVREMENNYE TEHNOLOGII V MEDICINE,http://www.stm-journal.ru/en/numbers/2020/5/1664/pdf,

The tractographic feature is built from the stroke lesion and average connectome information from a group of normal subjects. The tractographic feature takes into account different functional regions that may be affected by the stroke, thus complementing the commonly used stroke volume features. The proposed tractographic feature is tested on a public stroke benchmark Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation 2017 and achieves higher accuracy than the stroke volume and the state-of-the-art feature on predicting the mRS grades of stroke patients.

To that end we set out to (i) harmonize measures previously defined separately for different conditions, (ii) create clinical information models from the measures, and (iii) restructure the annotation to make the sets machine-readable. Materials and Methods: First, we harmonized the semantic meaning of individual measures across all the 28 standard-sets published to date, in a harmonized measure repository. Second, measures corresponding to four conditions (Breast cancer, Cataracts, Inflammatory bowel disease and Heart failure) were expressed as logical models and mapped to reference terminologies in a pilot study. Results: The harmonization of semantic meaning resulted in a consolidation of measures used across the standard-sets by 15%, from 3,178 to 2,712. These were all converted into a machine-readable format. 61% of the measures in the 4 pilot sets were bound to existing concepts in either SNOMED CT or LOINC. Discussion: The harmonization of ICHOM measures across conditions is expected to increase the applicability of ICHOM standard-sets to multi-morbid patients, as well as facilitate their implementation in health information systems. Conclusion: Harmonizing the ICHOM measures and making them machine-readable is expected to expedite the global adoption of systematic and interoperable outcomes measurement. In turn, we hope that the improved transparency on health outcomes that follows will let health systems across the globe learn from each other to the ultimate benefit of patients.

76,Adaptive Physics-Based Non-Rigid Registration for Immersive Image-Guided Neuronavigation Systems.,2,,613608,,,,10.3389/fdgth.2020.613608,,"Objective: In image-guided neurosurgery, co-registered preoperative anatomical, functional, and diffusion tensor imaging can be used to facilitate a safe resection of brain tumors in eloquent areas of the brain. However, the brain deforms during surgery, particularly in the presence of tumor resection. Non-Rigid Registration (NRR) of the preoperative image data can be used to create a registered image that captures the deformation in the intraoperative image while maintaining the quality of the preoperative image. Using clinical data, this paper reports the results of a comparison of the accuracy and performance among several non-rigid registration methods for handling brain deformation. A new adaptive method that automatically removes mesh elements in the area of the resected tumor, thereby handling deformation in the presence of resection is presented. To improve the user experience, we also present a new way of using mixed reality with ultrasound, MRI, and CT. Materials and methods: This study focuses on 30 glioma surgeries performed at two different hospitals, many of which involved the resection of significant tumor volumes. An Adaptive Physics-Based Non-Rigid Registration method (A-PBNRR) registers preoperative and intraoperative MRI for each patient. The results are compared with three other readily available registration methods: a rigid registration implemented in 3D Slicer v4.4.0; a B-Spline non-rigid registration implemented in 3D Slicer v4.4.0; and PBNRR implemented in ITKv4.7.0, upon which A-PBNRR was based. Three measures were employed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the registration accuracy: (i) visual assessment, (ii) a Hausdorff Distance-based metric, and (iii) a landmark-based approach using anatomical points identified by a neurosurgeon. Results: The A-PBNRR using multi-tissue mesh adaptation improved the accuracy of deformable registration by more than five times compared to rigid and traditional physics based non-rigid registration, and four times compared to B-Spline interpolation methods which are part of ITK and 3D Slicer. Performance analysis showed that A-PBNRR could be applied, on average, in <2 min, achieving desirable speed for use in a clinical setting. Conclusions: The A-PBNRR method performed significantly better than other readily available registration methods at modeling deformation in the presence of resection. Both the registration accuracy and performance proved sufficient to be of clinical value in the operating room. A-PBNRR, coupled with the mixed reality system, presents a powerful and affordable solution compared to current neuronavigation systems.

This paper presents a novel solution in the early detection of pMCI people and classification of AD risk within MCI people. We proposed a model, MudNet, to utilise deep learning in the simultaneous prediction of progressive/stable MCI classes and time-to-AD conversion where high-risk pMCI people see conversion to AD within 24 months and low-risk people greater than 24 months. MudNet is trained and validated using baseline clinical and volumetric MRI data (n = 559 scans) from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The model utilises T1-weighted structural MRIs alongside clinical data which also contains neuropsychological (RAVLT, ADAS-11, ADAS-13, ADASQ4, MMSE) tests as inputs.

In this paper, we present our work in designing real-time sensing, and evaluating machine learning algorithms for real-time arrhythmia detection. Most of the existing work applies machine learning algorithms to electrocardiogram (ECG) images to detect abnormal patterns.

Nevertheless, they lack the interpretability and explainability that less complex algorithms are more fitted. Nowadays, one of the main goals of XDL research is to make these algorithms highly precise and explainable. There exist different systems and techniques, but only limited research on explaining deep neural networks using soft computing approaches. The purpose of this research is to propose the theoretical fundamentals of an explainable fuzzy-based deep learning (EFBDL) system that is both precise and explainable. The system comprises two main parts. First, the deep network part composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on Inception V4 for image classification, a transfer learning mechanism, and a feature extraction algorithm based on neuron perturbation. Second, a soft computing part comprised of a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS), a hierarchical network for natural language generation named granular linguistic model of a phenomenon (GLMP), and a human-machine integration methodology for linguistic rules named highly interpretable linguistic knowledge (HILK). The output of the overall system is an explanation of the neural network decision using natural language. This system focuses on preventing skin cancer rather than healing it.

The firmness of Meningioma is a critical factor that influences operative strategy and patient counseling. Conventional methods to predict the tumor firmness rely on the correlation between the consistency of Meningioma and their preoperative MRI findings such as the signal intensity ratio between the tumor and the normal grey matter of the brain. Machine learning techniques have not been investigated yet to address the Meningioma firmness detection problem. The main purpose of this research is to couple supervised learning algorithms with typical descriptors for developing a computer-aided detection (CAD) of the Meningioma tumor firmness in MRI images. Specifically, Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are extracted from real labeled MRI-T2 weighted images and fed into classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to learn association between the visual properties of the region of interest and the pre-defined firm and soft classes. The learned model is then used to classify unlabeled MRI-T2 weighted images. This paper represents a baseline comparison of different features used in CAD system that intends to accurately recognize the Meningioma tumor firmness. The proposed system was implemented and assessed using a clinical dataset.

To address this difficulty, we develop an automated detection system based on artificial intelligence (AI) in this study to simplify the diagnostic process of active tuberculosis (ATB) and improve the diagnostic accuracy using CT images.
DATA: A CT image dataset of 846 patients is retrospectively collected from a large teaching hospital. The gold standard for ATB patients is sputum smear, and the gold standard for normal and pneumonia patients is the CT report result. The dataset is divided into independent training and testing data subsets. The training data contains 337 ATB, 110 pneumonia, and 120 normal cases, while the testing data contains 139 ATB, 40 pneumonia, and 100 normal cases, respectively.
METHODS: A U-Net deep learning algorithm was applied for automatic detection and segmentation of ATB lesions. Image processing methods are then applied to CT layers diagnosed as ATB lesions by U-Net, which can detect potentially misdiagnosed layers, and can turn 2D ATB lesions into 3D lesions based on consecutive U-Net annotations. Finally, independent test data is used to evaluate the performance of the developed AI tool.
RESULTS: For an independent test, the AI tool yields an AUC value of 0.980.

The lamp is an interactive light with a deformable lampshade surface. We deployed transTexture lamps in the homes of three professional designers for two months with the aim of exploring possible interactions and engagements with the deformable lamp. Our findings show how participants experienced transTexture through pleasurable interactions and how they experienced deformation over time from reflections on these interactions. Analyzing the data through a materiality lens unpacked a creative process of drawing on the deformable lampshade surface, which results in the accumulation of substrates and transformations of deformations.

As a response, researchers are calling for data literacies and computational thinking to facilitate people's capacity and volition to make informed actions in their digital world. Yet, efforts and curricula towards a greater understanding of computational mechanisms of new media ecology are sorely missing from K12-education as well as from teacher education.

The lengthy time-consuming process of obtaining multiple recordings creates an obstacle in detecting epileptic patients in real time. An epileptic signature validated over EEG data of multiple similar kinds of epilepsy cases will haste the decision-making process of clinicians. In this paper, we have identified EEG data derived signatures for differentiating epileptic patients from normal individuals. Here we define the signatures with the help of various machine learning techniques, viz., feature selection and classification, pattern mining, and fuzzy rule mining These signatures will add confidence to the decision-making process for detecting epileptic patients. Moreover, we define separate signatures by incorporating few demographic features like gender and age. Such signatures may aid the clinicians with the generalized epileptic signature in case of complex decisions.","Epileptic signature,Epileptic Network,Feature Selection,Fuzzy Logic,EEGLAB",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Mathematics",,1.069,"ALGORITHM,CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEM,FURIA",FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE,,

Many medical researchers have expected that the use of the DNN algorithms would provide higher prediction results for their analysis. However, while these applications are currently underway for medical imaging data, they are not yet optimised for clinicopathologic data, with two-dimensional input space. One such challenge is the difficulty of applying deep learning to optimise hyperparameters, i.e., learning DNN models for more accurate prediction results. In this study, we identified parameters having a greater impact on predictive power, by applying DNNs to clinicopathologic data. Specifically, we predicted therapeutic response to platinum-based chemotherapy, based on data from 710 epithelial ovarian cancer patients. Predictive performance was measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC) after optimising six hyperparameters, including the number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, optimisation algorithm, weight initialisation, activation function for hidden layers, and dropout rate. By identifying the significant main effects, and interaction effects, of these hyperparameters on clinical prediction, we successfully determined combinations of hyperparameters contributing to higher predictive power. These approaches have ramifications for assessing therapeutic response to numerous treatments for various pathologies.","DNN,deep neural network,hyperparameter,predictive power",Article,"INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD, WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",Mathematical & Computational Biology,,0.743,CLASSIFICATION,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS,https://doi.org/10.1504/ijdmb.2020.109499,

Our model consists of the following steps: (1) biomarker filtration; (2) biomarker selection, using a cross-modal, superlayered neural network with an L1 penalty; (3) integration of selected biomarkers from gene expression and DNA methylation data; and (4) prediction model building. For comparison, machine learning methods were used, alone and in combination. In these analyses, SCR-SNN was applied to gene expression and methylation data of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma from The Cancer Genomic Atlas. The SCR-SNN model well classified lung cancer subtypes, using only a small number of markers.

Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is an important research topic in the field of brain medicine, which can classify rs-fMRI data to automatically diagnose brain diseases. However, the original features of the rs-fMRI data are difficult to be extracted and the high-dimensional characteristics, which make the data analysis an extremely complicated task. Those have also plagued many researchers and bring great challenges to the existing pattern classification methods. Aiming at the high dimensionality of rs-fMRI data, in this paper, we propose a feature extraction approach based on the combination of neighborhood rough set and PCA, thereby improving the accuracy of migraine identification. Firstly, Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit plus was applied for preprocessing, calculating three characteristic indices: Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Functional Connectivity (FC. The inter-group difference analysis was performed by two-sample T test and GRF correction. Then, correlation coefficient matrix original features extraction was performed by means of automatic anatomical label template (AAL). Finally, the original features were trained by the traditional classification algorithm in machine learning. The experimental results show that the propose approach can obtain good performance in predicting migraine.","Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging,migraine,correlation coefficient matrix,neighborhood rough set,principal component analysis,classification",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,1.797,"COMPLEXITY,RESONANCE",JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,,

However, because of the small inside diameter of the duct, it is difficult to completely fill it with concrete (grout) and even small mistakes can cause defects. Today, the complex and professional analysis of the signals measured by nondestructive testing (NDT) is conducted by a geophysicist to detect defects. However, owing to the limitations of NDT, accurate detection is very difficult. We introduce a deep learning model for defect detection to help working-level officials in the field immediately perform defect detection without the need for such complex and professional analysis. In this study, we apply the long short-term memory (LSTM), which is one of the deep learning models with good performance for time series data. Moreover, we use raw impact echo (IE) signals measured using IE equipment and some characteristics of the bridge (concrete thickness, depth of duct, and distance between the measured point and hit point). At this time, because the value of the signal was very small, we standardized the raw data to perform normalization. As a result of the experiment, we obtained an average accuracy of 82.58%.","defect detection,long short-term memory,impact echo,PSC box-girder bridge,deep learning",Article,"MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION, 1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN","Instruments & Instrumentation,Materials Science",,0.71,CONCRETE,SENSORS AND MATERIALS,https://myukk.org/SM2017/sm_pdf/SM2094.pdf,

This requires to accurately predict hand gestures capable of grabbing varying objects and execute them timely as intended by the user. Current approaches often rely on physiological signal inputs such as Electromyography (EMG) signal from residual limb muscles to infer the intended motion. However, limited signal quality, user diversity and high variability adversely affect the system robustness. Instead of solely relying on EMG signals, our work enables augmenting EMG intent inference with physical state probability through machine learning and computer vision method. To this end, we: (1) study state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to select a performant source of knowledge transfer for the prosthetic hand, (2) use a dataset containing object images and probability distribution of grasp types as a new form of labeling where instead of using absolute values of zero and one as the conventional classification labels, our labels are a set of probabilities whose sum is 1. The proposed method generates probabilistic predictions which could be fused with EMG prediction of probabilities over grasps by using the visual information from the palm camera of a prosthetic hand.

A deep learning-based object recognition algorithm is used to calculate the location of the objects on the online camera view from a depth camera. After the bounding box of the objects is estimated, the location of the SSVEP flickers are designed to overlap on the object locations. An overlapping FFT and SVM is used to recognize the EEC signals into corresponding classes. In experimental results, the classification rate for camera view scenario is more than 94.1%.
