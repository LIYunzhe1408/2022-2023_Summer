Early diagnosis of the disease can improve the patient's survival rate. The manual diagnosis involves clinicians to visually examine microscopic bone marrow images for any signs of cells proliferation. This step is often laborious and can be highly subjective due to clinician's expertise. Automatic system based on WBC identification and counting provides more accurate result than manual method. This system is mainly based on three major steps: cell's segmentation, cell's characterisation and cell's classification. In the proposed system, microscopic images of bone marrow blood are segmented by the combination of watershed transform and the evidence theory, the segmented cells are characterised with shape and colour texture features, and then classified into plasma cells or not plasma cells with three supervised classifiers; support vector machines, K-nearest neighbour and decision tree. Experimental results show that the recognition of plasma cells with the K-nearest neighbour achieved 97% of correct rate with 100% of specificity.","myeloma,plasma cell,bone marrow images,segmentation,evidence theory,watershed,characterisation,shape,colour texture,classification",Article,"INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD, WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",Engineering,,,"IMAGE,SEGMENTATION,BLOOD,CLASSIFICATION,RECOGNITION",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,,

In spite of several advantages, titanium alloys are difficult to machine because of their poor thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity. Identification of suitable machining conditions is the key to get the good surface finish. Chatter during machining brings adverse effects in surface quality, dimensional accuracy and in tool life. The objective of this work is to identify chatter free machining conditions for machining titanium alloys and to predict the chatter occurrence with the help of machine leaning algorithms. During machining of titanium alloy, the vibration signals are captured for various machining conditions using accelerometer. From the raw signal statistical features are extracted and decision tree algorithm is used in selecting the dominant features. By monitoring the dominant features, chatter occurrences are predicted using Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, compressed sensing (CS) circumvents this sensing process usually using a random sensing matrix to acquire fewer measurements and reconstructs the multispectral image based on a sparsity assumption. However, a random matrix may not be physically realizable nor the best fit for extracting information pertaining a high-level vision task such as segmentation. Here, we use a deep neural network to jointly optimize the sensing scheme subject to optical realizability constraints, and segment the multispectral image in the compressed domain.

Through human-robot interaction, it can monitor the mental health status of perinatal women in real time while collecting user health data. The application of human-robot interaction in mental health services has attracted widespread attention.

Hence, a scientific basis is needed for the determination of the feasible combination of process parameters that will bring about excellent mechanical properties. This study examines the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) for the prediction of mechanical properties, namely density and hardness of graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)/polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposite developed under various operating conditions of spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. A back-propagation having a 2-12-2 architecture and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed to predict the mechanical performance in terms of density and hardness property of GNP/PLA nanocomposites. The predictions of the modelled results were compared with those of the experimental value obtained. The model gave a low root-mean-squared error and performed well with the correlation coefficient (R) for both outputs; density (0.95497) and hardness (0.9832) found to be close to 1. The results of the predicted data were discovered to be very consistent with the values obtained from the actual experimental test result. Thus, our study confirmed the efficiency of a well-trained ANN system in estimating the density and hardness property of SPSed GNP/PLA nanocomposites. Hence, the ANN technique is a reliable decision-making tool capable of reducing the excessive cost incurred in experimental characterisation for newly developed polymer composites. This will serve as a decision-making tool for manufacturing industries where SPS techniques will be employed for processing GNP/PLA polymer nanocomposite.","ANN,density,hardness,SPS,PLA,GNP",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS, KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",Engineering,,,"MOLDING,PROCESS,PARAMETERS,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,GRAPHENE,OPTIMIZATION,COMPOSITES,BEHAVIOR,CRYSTALLIZATION,WEAR",COGENT ENGINEERING,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311916.2020.1720894?needAccess=true,

The presented work takes a step towards these goals by using wearable muscle and motion sensors to detect gestures without dedicated calibration or training procedures.

The detection of the lung cancer tumor at its early stage is also a challenging problem. Early identification of tumor has the potential to help in saving a large number of human lives. An automatic lung cancer detection and classification (ALCDC) system based on computed tomography (CT) scan images is effective, but the design of a robust lung cancer detection and classification system is a challenging problem. The existing designs of lung cancer detection and classification systems are based on hand-engineered techniques and their outcomes in terms of accuracy and other performance measures are limited. Driven by the exceptional deep learning (DL) success in several recognition related tasks, an ALCDC system based on CT scan images using DL is introduced. For this purpose, using the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, an ALCDC system is built to detect and classify whether the tumors found in the lungs are malignant or benign. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed ALCDC system is validated using images from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and the Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI). The results indicate that the proposed ALCDC system gives an accuracy of 97.2%. The comparison shows that the proposed ALCDC system performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems. The proposed ALCDC will be helpful in medical diagnosis research and health care systems.","lung,computed tomography,convolutional neural network,detection,classification",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Computer Science,,,"NODULES,IMAGES",,,

The Great Pacific garbage patch consisting of abandoned plastics is killing marine life. In addition, micro-plastics decomposed by solar UV radiation and waves can accumulate in the human body. Recycling plastic is accordingly a critical element of waste management. As part of the solution to this problem, factory automation in recycling plants to handle more waste faster is essential. The amount of reproduced raw plastics is proportional to the inlet speed of the plastics waste stream into a recycling process line. Furthermore, the quality of recycled products with reproduced raw plastics depends on the sorting purity through the line. Thus, an automated system should be capable of real-time classification of the plastics category and rapid manipulation for removing selected plastics. We propose a real-time sorting system for mixed color plastics by applying a machine learning algorithm and a parallel manipulator with a vacuum suction pad. The learning data and picking test samples were collected from a municipal waste disposal site at RM corporation factory.

This can be applied to the domain of simulations in low altitude flight imaging simulations. Low altitude imaging consists of images taken at an altitude of less than 500 feet above the surface in this context. Simulating the acquisition of such images using commercial game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine 4 is possible. However one defect in the images thus taken is the repetition of material images on the terrain itself. This lowers the fidelity of the simulation since materials that represent certain characteristics of the ground are based on a single or small group of source images. In the past few years a set of generative neural network architectures known as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have seen much development. We propose a method using GANs in order to generate variations of similar terrain with a high degree of randomness in order to replace tiling caused by using similar images. We have been sucessful in developing textures for a variety of terrain types including sand and grass by utilizing the evaluation functions and blending algorithms we have constructed. Using these images as terrain textures will allow for a higher fidelity simulation and will provide a more accurate test bed for computer vision algorithms operating in the domain of low altitude flight.,,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Engineering,,,,,,

The results show that the ANN model yields a high accuracy of 99.6% and an impressive weighted accuracy of 90.9% on the selected dataset.

These current strategies use pre-defined threat material signatures in contrast to adaptability towards new and emerging threat signatures. To address this issue, the concept of adaptive automatic threat recognition (AATR) was proposed in previous work.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present a solution to AATR based on such X-ray CT baggage scan imagery. This aims to address the issues of rapidly evolving threat signatures within the screening requirements. Ideally, the detection algorithms deployed within the security scanners should be readily adaptable to different situations with varying requirements of threat characteristics (e.g., threat material, physical properties of objects).
METHODS: We tackle this issue using a novel adaptive machine learning methodology with our solution consisting of a multi-scale 3D CT image segmentation algorithm, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier for object material recognition and a strategy to enable the adaptability of our approach. Experiments are conducted on both open and sequestered 3D CT baggage image datasets specifically collected for the AATR study.
RESULTS: Our proposed approach performs well on both recognition and adaptation. Overall our approach can achieve the probability of detection around 90% with a probability of false alarm below 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our AATR shows the capabilities of adapting to varying types of materials, even the unknown materials which are not available in the training data, adapting to varying required probability of detection and adapting to varying scales of the threat object.","Adaptive automatic threat recognition,X-ray computed tomography,Image segmentation,Baggage security screening,Automatic threat detection",Article,"IOS PRESS, NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","Instruments & Instrumentation,Optics,Physics",,1.159,CLASSIFICATION,JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,http://dro.dur.ac.uk/29897/1/29897.pdf?DDD4+DDC116+DDD280+qhww73,

These lymphatic vessels surround the cerebral cortex and have been recently found to drain waste from the brain. Studies on mice have shown loss of memory and impairment in cognitive ability if the vessels' draining capacity does not function adequately. As the meningeal lymphatic vasculature itself is a recent discovery, there is no software tailored for automatically segmenting these images. Instead, segmentation must be performed by hand, which is a tedious and error-prone process. By building an automatic segmentation tool for these vessels, we can provide informatics for understanding and researching them, in a quick and reliable way. A convolutional neural network, called u-net, is adapted to the vessel segmentation application, with the goal of teaching the network how to segment the vessels. Segmentation using u-net is compared to traditional non-learning based segmentation methods using Dice coefficient. Three complexity measures are also proposed to evaluate the segmentation quality: vessel ramification index, porosity, and vessel length. The existence of a technique and associated software to automatically segment and analyze these vessels will drastically speed up subsequent neuroscience research in the field.","u-net,segmentation,lymphatics,learning,vasculature,complexity,porosity,ramification",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Telecommunications",,,,,,

Different types of cells will have different gene expression profiles, thus they can be identified by these profiles. Predicting the cell type through expression profiles is of great practical significance. Previous application includes classifying cancers to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression, demonstrating the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy. In this work, this task of cell type identification is pursued by implementing and comparing multiple machine learning methods. The neural network model can reach an accuracy of 59 percent when predicting 21 cell types.

In this paper, a new deep learning fusion clustering framework is proposed to integrate multi-omics data (mRNA expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation) on the TCGA BRAC dataset for breast cancer subtype identification named as DLFC. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) and autoencoder (AE) are used to learn high-level data representations. Prior biological knowledge is used to guide the representation learning.

Early detection of cancerous cells is of vital importance in the lungs providing oxygen to the human body and excretion of carbon dioxide in the body as a result of vital activities. In this study, the detection of lung cancers is realized using LeNet, AlexNet and VGG-16 deep learning models. The experiments were carried out on an open dataset composed of Computed Tomography (CT) images. In the experiment, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used for feature extraction and classification purposes. In order to increase the success rate of the classification, the image augmentation techniques, such as cutting, zooming, horizontal turning and filling, were applied to the dataset during the training of the models. Because of the outstanding success of AlexNet model, the features obtained from the last fully-connected layer of the model were separately applied as the input to linear regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and softmax classifiers. A combination of AlexNet model and k NN classifier achieved the most efficient classification accuracy as 98.74 %. Then, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method was applied to the deep feature set to choose the most efficient features. Consequently, the success rate was yielded as 99.51 % by reclassifying the dataset with the selected features and k NN model.

Although there are a wide variety of disease types regarding OM, the most commonly seen disorders are acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The examination of OM in the clinics is realized subjectively. This subjective examination is error-prone and leads to a limited variability among specialist. For these reasons, computer-aided systems are in demand. In this study, we focus on recognizing normal, AOM, CSOM, and earwax tympanic membrane (TM) conditions using fused fine-tuned deep features provided by pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These features are applied as the input to several networks, such as an artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (k NN), decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, we release a new publicly available TM data set consisting of totally 956 otoscope images. As a result, the DCNNs yielded promising results. Especially, the most efficient results were provided by VGG-16 with an accuracy of 93.05 %. The fused fine-tuned deep features improved the overall classification success. Finally, the proposed model yielded promising results with an accuracy of 99.47 %, sensitivity of 99.35 %, and specificity of 99.77 % using the combination of the fused fine-tuned deep features and SVM model. Consequently, this study shows that fused fine-tuned deep features are rather useful in recognizing different TMs and these features can provide a fully automated model with high sensitivity.

The preprocessed signal is initially decomposed into scattering coefficients with various orders and scales employing scattering transform. Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) and Log energy entropy (LogEn) of the sub-band coefficients are obtained to characterize the epileptic seizure signals. Then the joint features are fed into five classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM), genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, we not only compare the classification results and the time efficiency derived from different classifiers, but also explore the discrimination performance of the proposed methodology based on ten different classification tasks with great clinical significance. The prominent classification accuracy (ACC) of 99.87 %, 99.59 %, 99.58 %, 99.56 % and 99.80 % are achieved using the above five classifiers respectively.

The automatic segmentation and classification are two core technologies of the proposed CAD system, which are both realized based on CNN. The segmentation of liver and tumor is implemented by a fully convolutional networks (FCN) based on a fine tuning VGG-16 model with two additional 'skip structures' using a weighted loss function which helps to solve the problem of inaccurate tumor segmentation caused by the inevitably unbalanced training data. HCC classification is implemented by a 9-layer CNN classifier, whose input is a 4-channel image data constructed by combining the segmentation result of FCN with the original CT image. A total of 165 venous phase CT images including 46 diffuse tumors, 43 nodular tumors, and 76 massive tumors are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed CAD system. The classification accuracy of CNN classifier for diffuse, nodular and massive tumors are 98.4%, 99.7% and 98.7% respectively, which are significantly improved in contrast with the traditional feature-based ANN and SVM classifiers.

Different tube current and sweep angular range acquisition settings were repeated to acquire different DBT images. As a result, a total number of 66 cases of four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) reading was undertaken to the human observer and DLMO. The images of spheroidal mass with different sizes of 1.8, 2.3, 3.1, 3.9, 4.7, and 6.3 mm in the target slab of CIRS breast phantom were cropped by 200x200 size for their region of interest (ROI). A percentage of correct responses (P-c) was measured at the end of each human observer test and compared by the accuracy of prediction using DLMO. The results indicated that our proposed DLMO showed the averaged training accuracy 93% using 60 testing datasets after 50 epochs of training using 204 input training datasets. Both the accuracy and loss function in training session of categorical cross-entropy reached a plateau after 35 epochs. The sensitivity and specificity of the testing data from DLMO showed 78% and 98%, respectively, which is comparable to the P-c, 0.89, on 4AFC test from the human observer. Although the current number of datasets is too small to apply in clinical trials, the authors considered that our DLMO on the phantom study is useful for initial trial of analysis on DBT images.","Deep learning,model observer,alternative forced choice,breast tomosynthesis",Proceedings Paper,"SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING, 1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","Engineering,Optics,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,

A new phantom platform (Mercury Phantom, Gammex) provides test patterns for estimating the task transfer function (TTF) or noise power spectrum (NPF) and simulates different patient sizes. Determining which image slices are suitable for analysis currently requires manual annotation of these patterns by an expert, as subtle defects may make an image unsuitable for measurement. We propose a method of automatically classifying these test patterns in a series of phantom images using deep learning techniques. By adapting a convolutional neural network based on the VGG19 architecture with weights trained on ImageNet, we use transfer learning to produce a classifier for this domain. The classifier is trained and evaluated with over 3,500 phantom images acquired at a university medical center. Input channels for color images are successfully adapted to convey contextual information for phantom images. A series of ablation studies are employed to verify design aspects of the classifier and evaluate its performance under varying training conditions.

The accuracy of dual-energy CT (DECT)-derived parametric maps relies on image noise levels and the severity of artifacts. Suboptimal image quality may degrade the accuracy of physics-based mapping techniques and affect subsequent processing for clinical applications. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based method to accurately generate relative stopping power map (RSPM) based on the virtual monoenergetic images as an alternative to physics-based dual-energy approaches. For the training target of our deep-learning model, we manually segmented head-and-neck DECT images into brain, bone, fat, soft-tissue, lung and air, and then assigned different RSP values into the corresponding tissue types to generate a reference RSPM. We proposed to integrate a residual block concept into a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) framework to learn the nonlinear mapping between DECT 70keV/140keV monoenergetic image pairs and reference RSPM. We evaluated the proposed method with 18 head-and-neck cancer patients. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error (ME) were used to quantify the differences between the generated and reference RSPM. The average MAE between generated and reference RSPM was 3.1 +/- 0.4 % and the average ME was 1.5 +/- 0.5 % for all patients.

Interestingly, like proteins, they can fold into complex structures to perform their wide array of biological functions. Since the folded structure of a ncRNA may be critical to its function, many studies have attempted to exploit structural data to infer information, often using machine learning techniques. For instance, they have used predicted secondary structures as input features to various machine learning techniques, in order to classify RNA sequences. However, it is known that a strand of RNA can fold into more than one possible structure, and some strands even form different structures in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ncRNAs often function as RNA-protein complexes, which can affect structure. We therefore hypothesized that using a single predicted secondary structure for a single sequence may discard important information, which may result in poorer classification accuracy. To investigate this claim, we propose the use of secondary structure fingerprints as features for machine learning applications, and report on a preliminary evaluation of this approach. The fingerprints comprise two categories: a higher-level (topological) representation derived from RNA-As-Graphs (RAG), and free energy fingerprints based on a novel curated repertoire of small RNA motifs. We have also evaluated our deep learning architecture with k-mers as features, alone and combined with secondary structure fingerprints; to see whether secondary structures or nucleotide composition is more useful in RNA classification, and whether or not both feature types complement each other well.","RNA classification,non-coding RNA,secondary structure,deep learning,k-mers",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,,"NONCODING,RNAS,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS,TETRALOOP,HAIRPINS,CD-HIT,PREDICTION,LOOP,GNRA,CLASSIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION,MOTIF",,,

However, the heart color Doppler echocardiography report, blood biochemical indicators and other basic information can reflect the degree of heart damage in patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a combined reinforcement multitask progressive networks (CRMPN) model to predict the grade of coronary heart disease through heart color Doppler echocardiography report, blood biochemical indicators and ten basic body information items about the patient. In this model, the first step is performing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) pre-training through asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). Training data is adopted to optimize the recurrent neural networks (RNN) that parameterizes the stochastic policy. In the second step, we use soft parameter sharing module, hard parameter sharing module and progressive deep network to predict coronary heart disease.

To address this issue, we studied automated report generation for fundus images. Unlike the radiological field, t his task presents s everal c hallenges.

However, it is error-prone to detect epileptic seizures by manually observing EEG, and labeling epilepsy data is an expensive and time-consuming process. In this study, without requiring any epileptic EEG data and only based on normal EEGs, a new self-supervised learning method is proposed for anomaly detection on EEG signals. In particular, a series of scaling transformations are performed on the original EEG data to generated self-labeled scaled EEG data, where different labels correspond to different scaling transformations. Then using the self-labeled normal EEG dataset, a multi-class classifier can be trained to accurately predict the scaling transformations on new normal EEG data, but not accurately on abnormal (epileptic) EEGs. The inconsistency between the predicted scaling transformations and the ground-truth scaling transformations can then be used to measure the degree of abnormality in a new EEG data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised method outperforms classic anomaly detection methods including one-class support vector machine (SVM) and autoencoders. The robustness of the proposed method also has been empirically proved with different classifier structures and by varying relevant hyper-parameters.","Anomaly detection,Self-supervised learning,Epilepsy detection,Electroencephalography",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,,,,,

The progression rate and manifestation of PD is highly heterogenous, and the underlying etiology for this heterogeneity remains elusive. Although some studies have identified risk genes associated with the development of PD, it is unknown whether the patient genome influences the progression pattern of PD in any way. In this study, we used the whole-exome sequencing data of PD patients from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine whether an individual's genetic profile is associated with their progression pattern of PD. We used the three distinct progression subtypes defined by Zhang et al. as the outcome variable, and trained logistic regression and support vector classifiers. Our best performing model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 on the test set, indicating that the genetic profile of a PD patient appears to have some relationship with their likely disease course. We then interpreted our trained model by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on the sets of genes with high model coefficients for each progression subtype. The results showed enrichment for genes related to olfactory signaling in Subtype I and III, and an enrichment for genes related to protein glycosylation and glycation for Subtype I and II.

To further explore the ordinal relationship for lung nodule classification, this paper proposes a meta ordinal regression forest (MORF), which improves upon the state-of-the-art ordinal regression method, deep ordinal regression forest (DORF), in three major ways. First, MORF can alleviate the biases of the predictions by making full use of deep features while DORF needs to fix the composition of decision trees before training. Second, MORF has a novel grouped feature selection (GFS) module to re-sample the split nodes of decision trees. Last, combined with GFS, MORF is equipped with a meta learningbased weighting scheme to map the features selected by GFS to tree-wise weights while DORF assigns equal weights for all trees.

The proposed model starts with predicting a coarse mask with a well-designed segmentation module, followed by a boundary rendering module, which exploits semantic information from different layers of feature maps to refine the boundary of the coarse mask. The designed rendering module is shown to achieve superior performance with dramatically fewer parameters by operating only on the segmented mask, rather than on the whole feature maps as the popular methods do.

To break this trade-off, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework, named IB-M, to align an Interpretable model and a Black-box Model for simultaneously optimizing model interpretation and model accuracy. Generally, we think most of samples that are well-clustered or away from the true decision boundary can be easily interpreted by an interpretable model. Removing those samples can help to learn a more accurate black-box model by focusing on the left samples around the true decision boundary. Inspired by this, we propose a data re-weighting based framework to align an interpretable model and a blackbox model, letting them focus on the samples what they are good at, hence, achieving both interpretation and accuracy. We implement our IB-M framework for a real medical problem of ultrasound thyroid nodule diagnosis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm can achieve a more interpretable and more accurate diagnosis than a single interpretable model and a single black-box model.","Interpretable model,Black-box model,Thyroid nodules",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC, 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,,,,,
