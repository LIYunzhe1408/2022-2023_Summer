1,BSCN: bidirectional symmetric cascade network for retinal vessel segmentation,20,1,,"Guo Yanfei,Peng Yanjun","Guo YF,Peng YJ",Peng YJ,10.1186/s12880-020-0412-7,Shandong University of Science & Technology,"Background Retinal blood vessel segmentation has an important guiding significance for the analysis and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. But the traditional manual method of retinal blood vessel segmentation is not only time-consuming and laborious but also cannot guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis. Therefore, it is especially significant to create a computer-aided method of automatic and accurate retinal vessel segmentation. Methods In order to extract the blood vessels' contours of different diameters to realize fine segmentation of retinal vessels, we propose a Bidirectional Symmetric Cascade Network (BSCN) where each layer is supervised by vessel contour labels of specific diameter scale instead of using one general ground truth to train different network layers. In addition, to increase the multi-scale feature representation of retinal blood vessels, we propose the Dense Dilated Convolution Module (DDCM), which extracts retinal vessel features of different diameters by adjusting the dilation rate in the dilated convolution branches and generates two blood vessel contour prediction results by two directions respectively. All dense dilated convolution module outputs are fused to obtain the final vessel segmentation results. Results We experimented the three datasets of DRIVE, STARE, HRF and CHASE_DB1, and the proposed method reaches accuracy of 0.9846/0.9872/0.9856/0.9889 and AUC of 0.9874/0.9941/0.9882/0.9874 on DRIVE, STARE, HRF and CHASE_DB1. Conclusions The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-art methods, the proposed method has strong robustness, it not only avoids the adverse interference of the lesion background but also detects the tiny blood vessels at the intersection accurately.","Retinal vessel segmentation,Bidirectional symmetric cascade network,Specific diameter scale,Dense dilated convolution,Scale detection",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"BLOOD-VESSELS,IMAGES,VALIDATION,TORTUOSITY,LEVEL",BMC MEDICAL IMAGING,https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12880-020-0412-7,

Midinfrared (mid-IR) spectroscopic imaging offers label-free molecular recording and virtual staining by probing fundamental vibrational modes of molecular components. This quantitative signal can be combined with machine learning to enable microscopy in diverse fields from cancer diagnoses to forensics. However, absorption of IR light by common optical imaging components makes mid-IR light incompatible with modern optical microscopy and almost all biomedical research and clinical workflows. Here we conceptualize an IR-optical hybrid (IR-OH) approach that sensitively measures molecular composition based on an optical microscope with wide-field interferometric detection of absorption-induced sample expansion. We demonstrate that IR-OH exceeds state-of-the-art IR microscopy in coverage (10-fold), spatial resolution (fourfold), and spectral consistency (by mitigating the effects of scattering). The combined impact of these advances allows full slide infrared absorption images of unstained breast tissue sections on a visible microscope platform. We further show that automated histopathologic segmentation and generation of computationally stained (stainless) images is possible, resolving morphological features in both color and spatial detail comparable to current pathology protocols but without stains or human interpretation. IR-OH is compatible with clinical and research pathology practice and could make for a cost-effective alternative to conventional stain-based protocols for stainless, all-digital pathology.","infrared spectroscopy,imaging,quantum cascade laser,pathology,breast cancer",Article,"NATL ACAD SCIENCES, 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,12.291,"COHERENCE,TOMOGRAPHY,MIE,SCATTERING,BREAST-CANCER,SPECTROSCOPY,MICROSPECTROSCOPY,CELLS,FIELD,CLASSIFICATION,INTERFEROMETER,PROTOCOL",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7035604,

The proposed framework estimates the blood pressure (BP) values obtained from signals generated from 14 volunteers subjected to a series of exercise routines. Herein, the physiological signals were first pre-processed, followed by the extraction of complexity features from both the PPG and ECG. Subsequently the complexity features were used in regression models (artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and LASSO) to predict the BP. The performance of the approach was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the predicted results and compared with the recommendations made by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Complexity features from the ECG and PPG were investigated independently, along with the combined dataset. It was observed that the complexity features obtained from the combination of ECG and PPG signals resulted to an improved estimation accuracy for the BP. The most accurate DBP result of 5.15 +/- 6.46 mmHg was obtained from ANN model, and SVM generated the most accurate prediction for the SBP which was estimated as 7.33 +/- 9.53 mmHg. Results for DBP fall within recommended performance of the BHS but SBP is outside the range. Although initial results are promising, further improvements are required before the potential of this approach is fully realised.","Blood pressure (BP),Complexity analysis,Photoplethysmogram (PPG),Electrocardiogram (ECG),Machine learning",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Engineering,Physics,Optics",,1.625,"HEART-RATE,SYSTEMS,ECG,PPG",OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS,http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/60140/1/Sen%20yang-merged.pdf,
4,The feasibility and acceptability of smart home technology using the Howz system for people with stroke,15,2,148-152,"Rogerson Louise,Burr Jonathan,Tyson Sarah","Rogerson L,Burr J,Tyson S",Tyson S,10.1080/17483107.2018.1541103,University of Manchester,"Purpose: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Howz smart home system for stroke survivors. Materials: Howz uses smart home technology to monitor users' activity in the home and machine learning algorithms to detect when their activity changes. This information made available to the user and a named contact (usually a family member) via the Howz app. If activity changes, an alert is then sent to the user and the named contact. Methods: Howz was installed in the homes of 19 stroke survivors who lived alone. The sensors installed; the number and nature of alerts; adverse events; any technical difficulties and how Howz was used were recorded. We also interviewed participants and their named contacts about their views and experiences of using Howz eight weeks after installation. Results: Installation was effective; no technological problems or adverse events were reported. All participants chose alerts regarding ""getting up"" and activity during the day and at night. There was a mean of 1.1 (sd 1.2) alerts/person. Participants found the system unobtrusive and were positive about it. They found it easy to use and would recommend it to others with stroke. The most frequently reported benefit was that Howz gave peace of mind for the users and/or the family/named contact that help would be at hand if needed. Conclusions: The Howz system was feasible and acceptable for stroke survivors. It gave users and their family an enhanced sense of security and peace of mind that help would be at hand if needed.
IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION
Although most stroke survivors are elderly and often suffer physical, visual and cognitive disabilities which are often considered as barriers to using smart home technology, this project has demonstrated the well-developed smart home technology is feasible and acceptable.
Users were able and willing to engage with the technology (to varying degrees) and had no concerns about invasion of privacy.
The main benefit of the Howz system is an enhanced sense of security for the user and their family that help is at hand if needed.","Stroke,smart home technology,telecare,telerehabilitation",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Rehabilitation,,2.619,COMMUNITY,DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY,,

An OHT system, which consists of multiple vehicles moving at high speeds on guided rails, is the primary automated material-handling system (AMHS) in a fab. Modern large-scale fabs have hundreds of vehicles moving lots between multiple processing machines. The dynamic routing method is a route guidance method that dynamically selects the best vehicle paths under given traffic conditions and congestion levels. Building on the learning method, we develop a reinforcement learning-based dynamic routing algorithm called QLBWR(lambda), which consists of a Boltzmann softmax policy and a reward function. The proposed algorithm uses real-time information to effectively guide each vehicle so that it avoids congestion and finds an efficient path. The algorithm is also designed with a low computational burden, such that the efficient route can be found for hundreds of vehicles in real time. Simulation analyses on an actual fab layout are used to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with common static and dynamic algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarking algorithms.","overhead hoist transport,routing,Q learning,reinforcement learning,semiconductor manufacturing",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Operations Research & Management Science",,6.715,"PETRI-NET,VEHICLES,AGVS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00207543.2019.1614692?needAccess=true,
6,Discrimination of white teas produced from fresh leaves with different maturity by near-infrared spectroscopy,227,,,"Li Chunlin,Zong Bangzheng,Guo Haowei,Luo Zhou,He Puming,Gong Shuying,Fan Fangyuan","Li CL,Zong BZ,Guo HW,Luo Z,He PM,Gong SY,Fan FY",Gong SY; Fan FY,10.1016/j.saa.2019.117697,Zhejiang University,"White tea is a special tea product with increasing market demand. The assessment of white tea quality is mainly based on panel sensory by sensory evaluation experts, which is time costly and is limited by many uncertainties. This study established a rapid and accurate method for classification of white teas produced from buds and young leaves and that produced from mature leaves and shoots using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR). Back propagation neural network modelling and support vector machine (SVM) modelling were compared with six pre-processing methods. The best performance was provided by SVM with particle swarm optimization combined with Savitzky-Golay filter pre-processing method, achieving the accuracy of 98.92% in test samples. The NIR-related chemical compounds of two categories of white teas produced from fresh leaves with different maturity were analyzed, including catechins, alkaloids, amino acids and flavonol glycosides. Compared with chemical component concentration, NIR absorbance had a distinct advantage in quick classification of white teas based on the principal components analysis. In addition, the sensory characteristics of two categories white teas produced from fresh leaves with different maturity were also assessed by panelist. The result showed that characteristics of ""umami-like"" and ""smooth"" were more likely present in white teas produced from buds and young leaves, while ""woody"" and ""coarse"" characteristics were usually present in white teas produced from mature leaves and shoots. Thus, NIR technique is a rapid and reliable method for discrimination of white teas produced from fresh leaves with different maturity, and is a potential method to discriminate sensory characteristics of white teas.

Weighting in the experiments was accomplished using analytical balances with precision as low as 0.0001 g. The NIR spectra data of cream with different concentration of indigotine were recorded. The original spectra was pretreated by SG smoothing, mean centering and second derivative. Random forest was applied to establish a quantitative analysis model for cream pigment content, and multiple evaluation criteria were selected to comprehensively evaluate the model. The R-2 was 0.9402, RMSEP was 0.2509 and RPD was 4.0893.

It is important to study compositional stability and crystal chemistry controlling the formation of BX6 octahedral periodic arrays in Ti-based perovskites. Here, we investigate on the formability of Ti-based mixed organic-inorganic and all-inorganic perovskite crystals via establishing a library of tolerance (t) and octahedral (mu) stability factors using random sampling of ionic radii. Structural mapping and machine learning analysis are performed for twelve Ti-perovskites selected by mixing/matching cations with halide anions. Formation probabilities from normal/binomial distributions are integrated into a statistical algorithm used in a ""Decision tree classifier"" to obtain training/testing datasets. We relate perovskites stability to cuboctahedral formation considering complex crystal chemistry including ionic radii, bond length from ions electronegativity, and bond-valence sums from coordination numbers. Results revealed that cuboctahedral B-sites should be occupied by Ti cations to have a stable structural composition. High formation tendencies are estimated for methylammonium Ti-based chloride or bromide perovskites. Game theory methods determined six formable structures (Cs2TiX6 and RbTiX3 for X = F-, Cl-, Br-). Probabilities of formation of future datasets with different halides are A(m)TiBr(3m) (0.93) > A(m)TiCl(3m) (0.91) > A(m)TiF(3m) (0.79) > A(m)TiI(3m) (0.52) matching statistical results with +/- 8% marginal error and 96.3% classification accuracy; there is optimality in having a (Ti-Br)-like structure for a balanced cuboctahedral.

11,A new model for predicting sulfur solubility in sour gases based on hybrid intelligent algorithm,262,,,"Chen Huasheng,Liu Chao,Xu Xiaoxiao,Zhang Lu","Chen HS,Liu C,Xu XX,Zhang L",Liu C,10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116550,Chongqing University,"The accurate prediction of solubility of elemental sulfur in high H2S-content gas (sour gas) is of critical importance in the exploitation of sour gas. Due to the measurement difficulties, high pressure and low sulfur content in the gas phase, there are limited experimental data about the solubility of sulfur in the literature to date. In order to determine the reliability of data about sulfur solubility in H2S, CO2 and CH4, an assessment test of experimental data for gas-solid system under high pressure is carried out. The assessment test is based on Gibbs-Duhem equation and P-R equation of state is used for modeling. The correlated parameters in the model are obtained by using chaos-based firefly algorithm (CFA). For the whole experimental data, the assessment results show that 28% data points are considered as thermodynamically consistent, 28% are inconsistent and 44% are deemed to be not fully consistent. After eliminating the unreliable data points, four optimization algorithms combined BP neural network and support vector regression (SVR) into eight hybrid intellect algorithms. The results show that the most accurate results can be obtained using CFA algorithm combined with support vector regression among eight hybrid intellect algorithms. Simultaneously, this new model can obtain more accurate results compared with previous proposed three empirical models. For sulfur solubility in sour gas, the result shows that the average relative deviation between the experimental data and calculated results (ARD) is 4.51%.

The evolution of the 3D microstructure of the bituminous coal before and after LN2 fracturing was studied, using a high-resolution 3D X-ray microanalyzer and 'Dragonfly' software. The pore-fracture structure was preliminarily segmented using a digital terrain model (DTM) threshold segmentation and then was optimized using a 'deep learning' model. The box-counting method and a pore network model (PNM) were used to analyze the fractal features, spatial size distribution, and connectivity of pore-fractures. The results of the fractal analysis showed that the 2D fractal dimension of pore-fracture in the horizontal and vertical directions increased significantly after LN2 fracturing. The PNM analyses showed that the number and size of equivalent pores and throats after fracturing were significantly higher than prior to fracture. The relatively large fractures play a decisive role in the coal permeability, although they account for a small proportion of the total number of fractures. The results of the permeability tests showed that LN2 fracturing can effectively destroy the original structure of the coal and improve its permeability. At a constant confining pressure, the permeability and permeability increment increased exponentially with increasing gas pressure. The permeability increment curve can be divided into two stages: micro-fracture seepage and large-fracture seepage. During the first phase, the incremental change in permeability is small. During the second stage, the permeability increment increases sharply due to the re-opening of micro-fractures and the formation of large fractures.","Coalbed methane,Bituminous coal,Liquid nitrogen,Microstructure,Permeability,mu CT",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,6.63,"FREEZE-THAW,EVOLUTION,METHANE,STIMULATION,SIMULATION,POROSITY,SAMPLES,DAMAGE,ROCK,FLOW",FUEL,,

Typically, a desired output (usually a gain profile, a noise profile, a transfer function or a similar continuous function) is given and the goal is to determine the corresponding set of input parameters (usually a set of input voltages, currents, powers, and wavelengths). We present a novel method for inverse system design using machine learning and apply it to Raman amplifier design. Inverse system design for Raman amplifiers consists of selecting pump powers and wavelengths that would result in a targeted gain profile. This is a challenging task due to highly-complex interaction between pumps and Raman gain.

However, this approach requires picking huge numbers of macromolecular particle images from thousands of low-contrast, high-noisy electron micrographs. Although machine-learning methods were developed to get rid of this bottleneck, it still lacks universal methods that could automatically picking the noisy cryo-EM particles of various macromolecules.
Results: Here, we present a deep-learning segmentation model that employs fully convolutional networks trained with synthetic data of known 3D structures, called PARSED (PARticle SEgmentation Detector). Without using any experimental information, PARSED could automatically segment the cryo-EM particles in a whole micrograph at a time, enabling faster particle picking than previous template/feature-matching and particle-classification methods. Applications to six large public cryo-EM datasets clearly validated its universal ability to pick macromolecular particles of various sizes. Thus, our deep-learning method could break the particle-picking bottleneck in the single-particle analysis, and thereby accelerates the high-resolution structure determination by cryo-EM.","SELECTION,MICROSCOPY,SYSTEM,VISUALIZATION,PROTEIN",Article,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS, GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Computer Science,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematics",,8.47,"SELECTION,MICROSCOPY,SYSTEM,VISUALIZATION,PROTEIN",BIOINFORMATICS,https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-pdf/36/4/1252/32527799/btz728.pdf,

In the present study, we propose a systematic framework that utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently select the ML model and materials descriptors from a huge number of alternatives and demonstrated its efficiency on two phase formation problems in high entropy alloys (HEAs). The optimized classification model allows an accuracy for identifying solid-solution and non-solid-solution HEAs to be up to 88.7% and further for recognizing body-centered-cubic (BCC), face-centered-cubic (FCC), and dual-phase HEAs to reach 91.3%.

This demands for a viable, feasible and cost-effective technique for the defect recognition using timely detection of MC in fruits and vegetables to maintain a healthy sensory characteristic of fruits. Here we propose a non-invasive machine learning (ML) driven technique to monitor variations of MC in fruits using the terahertz (THz) waves with Swissto12 material characterization kit (MCK) in the frequency range of 0.75 THz to 1.1 THz. In this regard, multi-domain features are extracted from time-, frequency-, and time-frequency domains, and applied three ML algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree (D-Tree) for the precise assessment of MC in both apple and mango slices. The results illustrated that the performance of SVM exceeded other classifiers results using 10-fold validation and leave-one-observation-out-cross-validation techniques.

In combination with machine learning technology, the introduction of artificial intelligence to flexible materials design, synthesis, characterization and application research will greatly promote the flexible materials research efficiency. In this study, the back propagation (BP) neural network based on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm was applied to determine the electrical properties of the flexible Ag/poly (amic acid) (PAA) composite structure and to develop flexible materials for its different applications. In the machine learning model, the concentration of PAA, the ion exchange time of AgNO3, and the concentration and reduction time of NaBH4 are set as input parameters, and the product of the sheet resistance of the Ag/PAA film and the processing time are set as output information. To overcome the situation whereby the BP neural network solution process could fall into the local optimum, the initial threshold and the weight of the BP neural network and the data import model are optimized by the DE algorithm. Utilizing 1077 learning samples and 49 predictive samples, a machine learning model with very high accuracy was established and relative errors of predictions less than 1.96% were achieved. In terms of this model, the optimized fabrication conditions of the Ag/PAA composites, which are suitable for strain sensors and electrodes, were predicted. To identify the availability and applicability of the proposed algorithm, a strain gauge sensor, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a capacitive pressure sensor array were fabricated successfully using the optimized process parameters.

Methods This work proposes a new methodology using MRI (n = 31, across the spectrum of disc degeneration) that combines deep learning-based segmentation, atlas-based registration, and statistical parametric mapping for voxel-based analysis of T-1 rho and T-2 relaxation time maps to characterize disc degeneration and its associated disability.
Results Across degenerative grades, the segmentation algorithm produced accurate, high-confidence segmentations of the lumbar discs in two independent data sets. Manually and automatically extracted mean disc T-1 rho and T-2 relaxation times were in high agreement for all discs with minimal bias. On a voxel-by-voxel basis, imaging-based degenerative grades were strongly negatively correlated with T-1 rho and T-2, particularly in the nucleus. Stratifying patients by disability grades revealed significant differences in the relaxation maps between minimal/moderate versus severe disability: The average T-1 rho relaxation maps from the minimal/moderate disability group showed clear annulus nucleus distinction with a visible midline, whereas the severe disability group had lower average T-1 rho values with a homogeneous distribution.

In recent decades, the interest has grown to quantify the green area index as one of the key characteristics of crop canopies (e.g. for modelling transpiration, light interception, growth). The approach of estimating green area index based on multispectral reflection data from unmanned airborne vehicles with lightweight sensors might have the potential to deliver data with sufficient accuracy and high throughput during the whole season.
Materials and Methods
We therefore examined the applicability of a recently launched drone-based multispectral system (Sequoia, Parrot) for the prediction of whole season green area index in winter wheat, with data from field trials in Northern Germany (2017, 2018 and 2019). The explanatory power of different modeling approaches to predict green area index based on multispectral data was tested: linear and non-linear regression models, multivariate techniques, and machine learning algorithms. Further, different predictors were implemented in these models: multispectral data as raw bands and as ratios. Additionally, a new approach for the evaluation of green area index predictions during senescence is introduced. It is shown that a robust calibration during growth phase is applicable during senescence as well.
Results and Discussion
A linear model which includes all four wavebands provided by the sensor in three ratios (VIQUO) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm allow a reliable and sufficiently accurate whole season prediction. The VIQUO-model is recommended as the best model, as it is precise but still relatively simple, thus easier to communicate and to apply than the SVM. The integrated values of predicted green area indices in an independent trial are highly correlated with their final biomass (R-2: VIQUO = 0.84, SVM = 0.85) which represents the process of radiation interception, one of the determining factors of growths. This is an indicator for both, a robust model calibration and a high potential of the tested multispectral system for agricultural research and crop management.","green area index,unmanned aerial vehicle,multispectral,winter wheat,whole season,vegetation index,sequoia camera",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Plant Sciences,,6.612,"HYPERSPECTRAL,VEGETATION,INDEXES,UNMANNED,AERIAL,VEHICLES,GRAIN-YIELD,CROP,NITROGEN,BIOMASS,LAI,EXPLOITATION,CAPABILITIES,CANOPIES",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033565,

Reflectance differences among flour, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, and Cheyletus eruditus were relatively distinct. Majority of the shape features, including area, perimeter, the major, and minor axis in C. eruditus were remarkably larger than flour and T. putrescentiae. Textural features reached the level of the maximum significance except for contrast with one-way analysis of variance. Images under the ant colony optimization (ACO) wavebands in random forests (RF) classification showed at least 89% recognition rates, better than the successive projections algorithm wavebands. Artificial neural networks (ANN) with ACO wavebands gave higher recognition accuracies in training and validation sets than RF. Further analysis verified hyperspectrum with ACO-PCA-ANN (PCA, principal component analysis), which showed over 98% accuracy. This study revealed the promising potential of HSI coupled with ACO-PCA-ANN as an accurate and rapid method for detecting mites in flour.
Practical applications Mite infection in flour is a global problem and an important research area related to stored food safety and quality control in the food industry. An effective classification method for mite contaminants with automated detection has not been previously established in the literature.

Since their discovery, natural agents such as trampling phenomena have been a topic of great taphonomic interest. Nevertheless, the majority of investigation into these traces has focused almost exclusively on their differentiation from other anthropic agents such as cut marks. In recent years, advances into bone surface modification analysis via geometric morphometrics have proven useful for in-depth characterization of different taphonomic traces; including cut, tooth and percussion marks. Through this, a preliminary study of trampling marks using advanced 3D digital microscopy was able to detect differences between what have since been known as scratch and graze marks. The present study expands from this, developing a more detailed analysis of these traces. Here, we use advanced data science techniques to provide a means of understanding trampling mark variations, contributing to our knowledge of site formation processes. Our results show how scratch and graze marks are a product of progressional decay and changes in cortical hardness, providing a new means of understanding taphonomic processes.
Lay Description The study of microscopic bone surface modifications in archaeology and palaeontology is of great importance, allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the formation of a site and providing a means of interpreting the fossil register. The damage that sedimentary abrasion can produce, however, is likely to distort and influence these studies, thus requiring a detailed understanding of the different traces that can be found on different materials. Here, we use advanced 3D digital microscopy and pattern recognition algorithms to analyse the different marks produced in different sedimentological contexts, also controlling for other variables such as the state of the bone when buried, the type of bone and the time exposed to these types of damages. Through this detailed microscopic analysis of these types of damages, we are able to conclude that morphological variations in trampling marks are product of the state of decay when the bones are buried.","3D microscopy,Archaeological data science,Cortical hardness,Diagenesis,Taphonomy",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Microscopy,,,"MACHINE,LEARNING,ALGORITHMS,SURFACE,MODIFICATIONS,BSM,GEOMETRIC,MORPHOMETRICS,CUT-MARKS,ARCHAEOLOGICAL,RECORD,BONE,SITE,DECOMPOSITION,MORPHOLOGY,TARRAGONA",JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY,,

We show that vast numbers of adsorbents and adsorbing molecules can be explored in a powerful way by coupling atomistic simulations with machine learning. This concept is demonstrated by describing the adsorption of similar to 54 000 industry-relevant chemicals in an experimentally derived set of thousands of metal-organic framework materials.

Realization of fundamental synaptic plasticities on hard-ware devices would endow new intensions for neuromorphic devices. Spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP) is one of the most important synaptic learning mechanisms in brain cognitive behaviors. It is thus interesting to mimic the SRDP behaviors on solid-state neuromorphic devices. In the present work, nanogranular phosphorus silicate glass (PSG)-based proton conductive electrolyte-gated oxide neuromorphic transistors have been proposed. The oxide neuromorphic transistors have good transistor performances and frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity behavior. Moreover, the neuromorphic transistor exhibits SRDP activities. Interestingly, by introducing priming synaptic stimuli, the modulation of threshold frequency value distinguishing synaptic potentiation from synaptic depression is realized for the first time on an electrolyte-gated neuromorphic transistor. Such a mechanism can be well understood with interfacial proton gating effects of the nanogranular PSG-based electrolyte. Furthermore, the effects of SRDP learning rules on pattern learning and memory behaviors have been conceptually demonstrated. The proposed neuromorphic transistors have potential applications in neuromorphic engineering.","electrical double layer,neuromorphic devices,spike-rate-dependent plasticity,metaplasticity,proton gating,neuromorphic transistor",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"LONG-TERM,POTENTIATION,SYNAPTIC,PLASTICITY,ARTIFICIAL,SYNAPSE,TRANSISTOR,DEVICE,MODEL",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,,

The most common particle size analyser relies on measuring the angle-dependent diffracted light from a sample illuminated by a laser beam. Compared to other non-light-based counterparts, such a laser diffraction scheme offers precision, but it does so at the expense of size, complexity and cost. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a new particle size analyser in a collimated beam configuration using a consumer electronic camera and machine learning. The key novelty is a small form factor angular spatial filter that allows for the collection of light scattered by the particles up to predefined discrete angles. The filter is combined with a light-emitting diode and a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor array to acquire angularly resolved scattering images. From these images, a machine learning model predicts the volume median diameter of the particles. To validate the proposed device, glass beads with diameters ranging from 13 to 125 mu m were measured in suspension at several concentrations. We were able to correct for multiple scattering effects and predict the particle size with mean absolute percentage errors of 5.09% and 2.5% for the cases without and with concentration as an input parameter, respectively. When only spherical particles were analysed, the former error was significantly reduced (0.72%). Given that it is compact (on the order of ten cm) and built with low-cost consumer electronics, the newly designed particle size analyser has significant potential for use outside a standard laboratory, for example, in online and in-line industrial process monitoring.
Analysis: Novel design uses machine learning for characterising materials Scientists have developed low-cost particle size analyser (PSA) for conducting quality control and product testing in a range of industries, including the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics. Currently, laser diffraction PSAs that use static light scattering to measure the size distribution of particles from hundreds of nanometres to several millimetres are the most widely used technology. However, these devices are generally large, expensive and complicated to operate, making them impractical for many industrial applications. Led by Valerio Pruneri from ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain, a team of researchers has made a low-cost, miniaturised PSA capable of determining the volume median diameter of particles suspended in liquids. The novel design incorporates a collimated beam configuration using a commonly available image sensor to capture scattering images and machine learning to predict the particle size distribution.","LIGHT-SCATTERING,NEURAL-NETWORKS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DIFFRACTION,DENSITY",Article,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP, MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Optics,,16.996,"LIGHT-SCATTERING,NEURAL-NETWORKS,DISTRIBUTIONS,DIFFRACTION,DENSITY",LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7016131,

To model the ANN, a numerical periodic homogenization in several parameters is used. To construct the model, five main material and geometrical input parameters are utilized. Multilayer perceptron neural networks are designed and trained (with the best selected ANN model) by the sets of input-output patterns using the backpropagation algorithm.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolism abnormality that is posing severe threat, exercising substantial pressure on human health worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem around the world. In 1980, 108 million adults worldwide had diabetes. By 2040 the number is expected to reach 642 million adults. Hence extensive research in interdisciplinary field that uses skills from various fields such as statistics machine learning, artificial intelligence, visualization, etc. is carried out for better management of diabetes. In this paper, the focus is to use time series forecasting algorithms. Data-driven models in time series machine learning are used to derive meaningful and appropriate information from large volumes of blood glucose level and related data for precise forecasting of upcoming blood glucose level fluctuations. Not only can the patient and physician be informed beforehand, to avert complications, but also it aids in predicting response to certain medications with ease. In this case, univariate data-driven models from time series machine learning algorithms are implemented on 2 different continuous glucose monitoring sensor datasets: Libre Pro dataset of 10 patients and Ohio T1DM dataset of 6 patients. A comparison of performance evaluation metrics of the different time series machine learning algorithms is drawn based on root mean squared error (RMSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE) and Theil's U, which are statistical analyses, and Clarke's error grid, which is clinical analysis for prediction horizon from 15 to 45 min.

However, understanding their chemistry is still an open and debated topic, especially for complex compounds such as approximants and quasicrystals. In this work, targeted topological data mining succeeded in (i) selecting all known Mackay-type approximants, (ii) uncovering the most important geometrical and chemical factors involved in their formation, and (iii) guiding the experimental work to obtain a new binary Sc-Pd 1/1 approximant for icosahedral quasicrystals containing the desired cluster. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data analysis supplemented by electron density reconstruction using the maximum entropy method, showed fine structural peculiarities, that is, smeared electron densities in correspondence to some crystallographic sites. These characteristics have been studied through a comprehensive density functional theory modeling based on the combination of point defects such as vacancies and substitutions. It was confirmed that the structural disorder occurs in the shell enveloping the classical Mackay cluster, so that the real structure can be viewed as an assemblage of slightly different, locally ordered, four shell nanoclusters. Results obtained here open up broader perspectives for machine learning with the aim of designing novel materials in the fruitful field of quasicrystals and their approximants.

Due to the inherent limitations of MCT, a balance should be made between the field of view (FOV) and resolution of rock MCT images-a large FOV at low resolution (LR) or a small FOV at high resolution (HR). However, large FOV and HR are both expected for reliable analysis results in practice. Super-resolution (SR) is an effective solution to break through the mutual restriction between the FOV and resolution of rock MCT images, for it can reconstruct an HR image from a LR observation. Most of the existing SR methods cannot produce satisfactory HR results on real-world rock MCT images. One of the main reasons for this is that paired images are usually needed to learn the relationship between LR and HR rock images. However, it is challenging to collect such a dataset in a real scenario. Meanwhile, the simulated datasets may be unable to accurately reflect the model in actual applications. To address these problems, we propose a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN)-based SR approach for real-world rock MCT images, namely, SRCycleGAN. In the off-line training phase, a set of unpaired rock MCT images is used to train the proposed SRCycleGAN, which can model the mapping between rock MCT images at different resolutions. In the on-line testing phase, the resolution of the LR input is enhanced via the learned mapping by SRCycleGAN. Experimental results show that the proposed SRCycleGAN can greatly improve the quality of simulated and real-world rock MCT images. The HR images reconstructed by SRCycleGAN show good agreement with the targets in terms of both the visual quality and the statistical parameters, including the porosity, the local porosity distribution, the two-point correlation function, the lineal-path function, the two-point cluster function, the chord-length distribution function, and the pore size distribution.

Automated segmentation of myocardial scar is critical for the potential clinical translation of this technique given the number of tomographic images acquired.
Methods In this paper, we describe the development of cascaded multi-planar U-Net (CMPU-Net) to efficiently segment the boundary of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium and scar from 3D LGE-MR images. In this approach, two subnets, each containing three U-Nets, were cascaded to first segment the LV myocardium and then segment the scar within the presegmented LV myocardium. The U-Nets were trained separately using two-dimensional (2D) slices extracted from axial, sagittal, and coronal slices of 3D LGE-MR images. We used 3D LGE-MR images from 34 subjects with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The U-Nets were trained using 8430 slices, extracted in three orthogonal directions from 18 images. In the testing phase, the outputs of U-Nets of each subnet were combined using the majority voting system for final label prediction of each voxel in the image. The developed method was tested for accuracy by comparing its results to manual segmentations of LV myocardium and LV scar from 7250 slices extracted from 16 3D LGE-MR images. Our method was also compared to numerous alternative methods based on machine learning, energy minimization, and intensity-thresholds.
Results Our algorithm reported a mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC), absolute volume difference (AVD), and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 85.14% +/- 3.36%, 43.72 +/- 27.18 cm(3), and 19.21 +/- 4.74 mm for determining the boundaries of LV myocardium from LGE-MR images. Our method also yielded a mean DSC, AVD, and HD of 88.61% +/- 2.54%, 9.33 +/- 7.24 cm(3), and 17.04 +/- 9.93 mm for LV scar segmentation on the unobserved test dataset. Our method significantly outperformed the alternative techniques in segmentation accuracy (P < 0.05).
Conclusions The CMPU-Net method provided fully automated segmentation of LV scar from 3D LGE-MR images and outperformed the alternative techniques.","convolutional neural network,late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging,left ventricle myocardium,left ventricular scar,U-Net",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"WHOLE,HEART,SEGMENTATION,MR,IMAGES,TISSUE,SIZE,2D",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

In this paper, we present and evaluate a deep learning-based method that includes pre-annotation of the phases and steps in surgical videos and user assistance in the annotation process. Methods We propose a classification function that automatically detects errors and infers temporal coherence in predictions made by a convolutional neural network. First, we trained three different architectures of neural networks to assess the method on two surgical procedures: cholecystectomy and cataract surgery. The proposed method was then implemented in an annotation software to test its ability to assist surgical video annotation. A user study was conducted to validate our approach, in which participants had to annotate the phases and the steps of a cataract surgery video. The annotation and the completion time were recorded. Results The participants who used the assistance system were 7% more accurate on the step annotation and 10 min faster than the participants who used the manual system. The results of the questionnaire showed that the assistance system did not disturb the participants and did not complicate the task.

DC vaccine treatment efficiency was demonstrated using histological analysis in pre-clinical studies; however, its usage was limited due to invasiveness. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of MRI texture features for detection of early immunotherapeutic response as well as overall survival (OS) of PDAC subjects following dendritic cell (DC) vaccine treatment in LSL-Kras(G12D);LSL-Trp53(R172H);Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) transgenic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Materials and methodsKPC mice were treated with DC vaccines, and tumor growth was dynamically monitored. A total of a hundred and fifty-two image features of T2-weighted MRI images were analyzed using a kernel-based support vector machine model to detect treatment effects following the first and third weeks of the treatment. Moreover, univariate analysis was performed to describe the association between MRI texture and survival of KPC mice as well as histological tumor biomarkers.ResultsOS for mice in the treatment group was 54.822.54 days while the control group had 35.39 +/- 17.17 days. A subset of three MRI features distinguished treatment effects starting from the first week with increasing accuracy throughout the treatment (75% to 94%). Besides, we observed that short-run emphasis of approximate wavelet coefficients had a positive correlation with the survival of the KPC mice (r=0.78, p<0.001). Additionally, tissue-specific MRI texture features showed positive association with fibrosis percentage (r=0.84, p<0.002), CK19 positive percentage (r=-0.97, p<0.001), and Ki67 positive cells (r=0.81, p<0.02) as histological disease biomarkers.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that MRI texture features can be used as imaging biomarkers for early detection of therapeutic response following DC vaccination in the KPC mouse model of PDAC. Besides, MRI texture can be utilized to characterize tumor microenvironment reflected with histology analysis.","Dendritic cell vaccine,Machine learning,Magnetic resonance imaging,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,Radiomics",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Research & Experimental Medicine,,5.76,"DENDRITIC,CELLS,CANCER,IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY,SURVIVAL,IMAGES",JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,https://escholarship.org/content/qt3fh446pj/qt3fh446pj.pdf?t=qcod3j,

How to design a versatile algorithm that can simultaneously deal with both aspects remains an impending problem. In this study, a Sparse-Graph Manifold Learning (SGML) method was proposed to balance the source sparseness and morphology, by integrating non-convex sparsity constraint and dynamic Laplacian graph model. Furthermore, based on the nonconvex optimization theory and some iterative approximation, we proposed a novel iteratively reweighted soft thresholding algorithm (IRSTA) to solve the SGML model. Numerical simulations and in vivo experiments result demonstrated that the proposed SGML method performed much superior to the comparative methods in spatial localization and tumor morphology recovery for various source settings. It is believed that the SGML method can be applied to the related optical tomography and facilitate the development of optical molecular tomography.","biology and medicine,bioluminescence tomography,image reconstruction techniques,inverse problems",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biophysics,Optics",,3.403,"RECONSTRUCTION,RESOLUTION,CANCER,REGULARIZATION,VALIDATION,SIMULATION,ACCURACY,BRAF",JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS,,

To date, the surveillance of tumor progression in real time for orthotopic bladder xenografts is highly dependent on semi-quantitative in vivo imaging technologies such as bioluminescence. While these imaging technologies can estimate tumor progression, they are burdened with requirements such as anesthetics, specialized equipment, and genetic modification of the injected cell line. Thus, a convenient and non-invasive technology to quantitatively monitor the growth of bladder cancer in orthotopic xenografts is highly desired. In this work, using a microfluidic chemiluminescent ELISA platform, we have successfully developed a rapid, multiparameter urine-based and non-invasive biomolecular prognostic technology for orthotopic bladder cancer xenografts. This method consists of two steps. First, the concentrations of a panel of four urinary biomarkers are quantified from the urine of mice bearing orthotopic bladder xenografts. Second, machine learning and principal component analysis (PCA) algorithms are applied to analyze the urinary biomarkers, and subsequently, a score is assigned to indicate the tumor growth. With this methodology, we have quantitatively monitored the orthotopic growth of human bladder cancer that was inoculated with low, medium, and high cancer cell numbers.

Although there has been progress towards implementing SNN functionalities in custom CMOS-based hardware using beyond Von Neumann architectures, the power-efficiency of the human brain has remained elusive. This has necessitated investigations of novel material systems which can efficiently mimic the functional units of SNNs, such as neurons and synapses. In this paper, we present a magnetoelectric-magnetic tunnel junction (ME-MTJ) device as a synapse. We arrange these synapses in a crossbar fashion and perform in situ unsupervised learning. We leverage the capacitive nature of write-ports in ME-MTJs, wherein by applying appropriately shaped voltage pulses across the write-port, the ME-MTJ can be switched in a probabilistic manner. We further exploit the sigmoidal switching characteristics of ME-MTJ to tune the synapses to follow the well-known spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule in a stochastic fashion. Finally, we use the stochastic STDP rule in ME-MTJ synapses to simulate a two-layered SNN to perform image classification tasks on a handwritten digit dataset. Thus, the capacitive write-port and the decoupled-nature of read-write path of ME-MTJs allow us to construct a transistor-less crossbar, suitable for energy-efficient implementation of in situ learning in SNNs.

Recent revolutions made in data science could have a great impact on traditional catalysis research in both industry and academia and could accelerate the development of catalysts. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science, can play a central role in this paradigm shift away from the use of traditional approaches. In this review, we present a user's guide for ML that we believe will be helpful for scientists performing research in the field of catalysis and summarize recent progress that has been made in utilizing ML to create homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The focus of the review is on the design, synthesis, and characterization of catalytic materials/compounds as well as their applications to catalyzed processes. The ML technique not only enhances ways to discover catalysts but also serves as a powerful tool to establish a deeper understanding of relationships between the properties of materials/compounds and their catalytic activities, selectivities, and stabilities. This knowledge facilitates the establishment of principles employed to design catalysts and to enhance their efficiencies. Despite such advantages of ML, it is noteworthly that the current ML-assisted development of real catalysts remains in its infancy, mainly because of the complexity of catalysis associated with the fact that catalysis is a time dependent dynamic event. In this review, we discuss how seamless integration of experiment, theory, and data science can be used to accelerate catalyst development and to guide future studies aimed at applications that will impact society's need to produce energy, materials, and chemicals. Moreover, the limitations and difficulties of ML in catalysis research originating from the complex nature of catalysis are discussed in order to make the catalysis community aware of challenges that need to be addressed for effective and practical use of ML in the field.","machine learning,catalysis informatics,high-throughput experiments/computations,data mining,structure-activity relationships",Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,13.721,"DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL,THEORY,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE,APPROACH,HIGH-THROUGHPUT,NEURAL-NETWORKS,KNOWLEDGE,EXTRACTION,ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE,STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS,ADSORPTION,ENERGIES,SCALING,RELATIONS,CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE",ACS CATALYSIS,,

However, these methods need to extract the handcrafted features that demand domain specific knowledge and image processing stage is time consuming. In order to tackle these problems, in this study, the authors propose a novel framework that ensembles three state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with multi-modality images for AD classification. In detail, they extract some slices from each subject of each modality, and every DCNN generates a probabilistic score for the input slices. Furthermore, a 'dropout' mechanism is introduced to discard low discrimination slices of the category probabilities. Then average reserved slices of each subject are acquired as a new feature.

The separation of wool/mohair fibres is an important issue and can be performed with human eye by using the microscopic images, that is not time/cost effective and not objective. The novelty of the presented study is to design an objective, easy, rapid, time and cost-effective method in order to separate wool fibre from mohair fibre by using a texture analysis based identification method. For this purpose, microscopic images of both wool and mohair fibres were preprocessed as the texture images.

Due to the nature of line-by-line printing and the slump of the material deposition in each extruded line, 3D printed structures exhibit obvious lines or marks at the layer interface, which affects surface finish quality and potentially affect bonding strength between layers. This makes it necessary to control the extrudate formation in 3DCP. However, it is difficult to directly analyse the extrudate formation process because the extrudate shape depends on many parameters. In this paper, a machine learning technique is applied to correlate the formation of the extrudate to the printing parameters using an Artificial Neural Network model. The training data for the model development was obtained from extrudates printed in 3DCP experiments. The performance of the trained model was experimentally validated and the predicted extrudate geometry resulting from the developed model showed good agreement to the actual extrudate geometry. Subsequently, the developed model was used to find proper nozzle shapes to produce designated extrudate geometries. Significant improvement on the printing quality was demonstrated using nozzle shapes generated from the model on 3D printed objects consisting a vertical wall, an inclined wall and a curved part.","COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH,NEURAL-NETWORKS,CONSTRUCTION,DESIGN,PREDICTION,ROUGHNESS,KNOWLEDGE,SHAPE,DEEP,FLOW",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Engineering,Materials Science",,9.881,"COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,NEURAL-NETWORKS,CONSTRUCTION,DESIGN,PREDICTION,ROUGHNESS,KNOWLEDGE,SHAPE,DEEP,FLOW",VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL PROTOTYPING,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/652762/2/Manuscript.docx,

Frequently, the classical methods break down owing to the curse of dimensionality, and popular strategies to overcome this are typically based on regularized versions of the classical methods. However, these approaches rely on loss functions that may not be robust and usually do not allow for the incorporation of prior information in a straightforward way. Fully Bayesian methods are equipped to handle both of these shortcomings quite naturally, and they offer the potential for improvements in network structure learning. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from time-series gene expression data, such as those common in perturbation experiments of biological systems. The proposed methodology uses global-local shrinkage priors for posterior selection of regulatory edges and relaxes the common normal likelihood assumption in order to allow for heavy-tailed data, which were shown in several of the cited references to severely impact network inference. We provide a sufficient condition for posterior propriety and derive an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo via Gibbs sampling in the electronic supplementary material. We describe a novel way to detect multiple scales based on the corresponding posterior quantities. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our approach in a simulation study and compare it with existing methods on real data from a T-cell activation study.","Bayesian shrinkage,horseshoe prior,gene networks,reverse engineering",Article,"ROYAL SOC, 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,,,"BAYESIAN-INFERENCE,REGULATORY,NETWORKS,RECONSTRUCTION,REGRESSION,APOPTOSIS,DYNAMICS",INTERFACE FOCUS,https://doi.org/10.1101/709741,

The myriad of illnesses and patient conditions render maintenance of glycemic control very challenging in this setting.
Materials and Methods: This study involved collection of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, and other associated measures, from the electronic medical records of 127 patients for the first 72 h of ICU care who upon admission to the ICU had a diagnosis of type 1 (n = 8) or type 2 diabetes (n = 97) or a glucose value >150 mg/dL (n = 22). A neural network-based model was developed to predict a complete trajectory of glucose values up to 135 min ahead of time. Model accuracy was validated using data from 15 of the 127 patients who were not included in the model training set to simulate model performance in real-world health care settings.
Results: Predictive models achieved an improved accuracy and performance compared with previous models that were reported by our research team. Model error, expressed as mean absolute difference percent, was 10.6% with respect to interstitial glucose values (CGM) and 15.9% with respect to serum blood glucose values collected 135 min in the future. A Clarke Error Grid Analysis of model predictions with respect to the reference CGM and blood glucose measurements revealed that >99% of model predictions could be regarded as clinically acceptable and would not lead to inaccurate insulin therapy or treatment recommendations.
Conclusion: The noted clinical acceptability of these models illustrates their potential utility within a clinical decision support system to assist health care providers in the optimization of glycemic management in critical care patients.","Machine learning,Clinical decision support,Predictive models,Intensive care unit,Glycemic control",Article,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC, 140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",Endocrinology & Metabolism,,4.699,"DIABETES-MELLITUS,GLUCOSE,CONTROL,MORTALITY,HYPERGLYCEMIA,MANAGEMENT,TIGHT,HYPOGLYCEMIA,INJURY,TIME",DIABETES TECHNOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS,,

Here, we introduce new local structure order parameters (LoStOPs) that are specifically designed to rapidly detect highly symmetric local coordination environments (e.g., Platonic solids such as a tetrahedron or an octahedron) as well as less symmetric ones (e.g., Johnson solids such as a square pyramid). Furthermore, we introduce a Monte Carlo optimization approach to ensure that the different LoStOPs are comparable with each other. We then apply the new local environment descriptors to define site and structure fingerprints and to measure similarity between 61 known coordination environments and 40 commonly studied crystal structures, respectively.

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.","ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS,REMOTE-SENSING DATA,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,SPATIAL PREDICTION,WATER-RETENTION,PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS,LAND-USE,SEMIARID RANGELANDS,TOPSOIL CARBON,TOTAL NITROGEN",Review,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH, BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",Agriculture,,6.691,"ORGANIC-CARBON,STOCKS,REMOTE-SENSING,DATA,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SPATIAL,PREDICTION,WATER-RETENTION,PEDOTRANSFER,FUNCTIONS,LAND-USE,SEMIARID,RANGELANDS,TOPSOIL,CARBON,TOTAL,NITROGEN",SOIL,https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-2019-57,

Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up.

Replacing incandescent and compact fluorescent light bulbs with energy-efficient, solid-state white lighting is one of the easiest and most promising solutions. Eu3+-substituted inorganic oxide phosphors are one class of materials that can serve as the red component in these new light bulbs, allowing the creation of warm white light. Unfortunately, the emission intensity in most of these materials cannot be reliably maintained at elevated temperatures. There is therefore a need to discover entirely novel phosphor materials that are thermally robust; however, this is generally a prolonged and expensive process requiring extensive synthetic effort. In this work, we develop a machine-learning regression algorithm based on 134 experimentally measured temperature-dependent Eu3+ emission data points to rapidly estimate the thermal quenching temperature (T-50), which is defined as the temperature when the emission intensity is half of the initial value. The T-50 was then predicted for more than 1000 potential oxide Eu3+ phosphor hosts using this model. Five compounds with predicted thermal quenching temperatures >423 K were subsequently selected and synthesized for validation of this approach. The phosphors, Sr2ScO3F, Cs2MgSi5O12, Ba2P2O7, LiBaB9O15, and Y3Al5O12, all exhibit good thermal stability when substituted with Eu3+, suggesting the success of our methodology.","machine learning,support vector regression,photoluminescence,inorganic phosphors,thermal quenching",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science",,9.57,"RED,PHOSPHOR,LUMINESCENCE,CONVERSION",ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,,

About 2000 survey participants were randomly assigned to one of four different information materials (brochures or videos) about the negative consequences of corruption or to a control group. While we do not find important effects in the full sample, applying machine learning methods for detecting effect heterogeneity suggests that some subgroups of students might react to the same information differently, albeit statistical significance mostly vanishes when accounting for multiple hypotheses testing. Taking the point estimates at face value, students who commonly plagiarize appear to develop stronger negative attitudes toward corruption in the aftermath of our intervention. Unexpectedly, some information materials seem inducing more tolerant views on corruption among those who plagiarize less frequently and in the group of male students, while the effects on female students are generally close to zero. Therefore, policy makers aiming to implement anti-corruption education at a larger scale should scrutinize the possibility of (undesired) heterogeneous effects across student groups.","Anti-corruption campaigns,Experiments,Corruption,Academic integrity,University,Students,Russia",Article,"PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO, PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Business & Economics,Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",,1.846,"SELECTION,GENDER,FIELD",EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS,http://doc.rero.ch/record/330174/files/combiningexperimentalevidencewithmachinelearningtoassesanti-corruption.pdf,

Method A fully connected neural network, denoted as DeepMARS, was trained using simulation data and added Gaussian noise. Two MRF-ASL models were used to generate the simulation data, specifically a single-compartment model with 4 unknowns parameters and a two-compartment model with 7 unknown parameters. The DeepMARS method was evaluated using MRF-ASL data from healthy subjects (N = 7) and patients with Moymoya disease (N = 3). Computation time, coefficient of determination (R-2), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were compared between DeepMARS and conventional dictionary matching (DM). The relationship between DeepMARS and Look-Locker PASL was evaluated by a linear mixed model.
Results Computation time per voxel was 4 seconds for DM in the single-compartment model. Compared with DM, the DeepMARS showed higher R-2 and significantly improved ICC for single-compartment derived bolus arrival time (BAT) and two-compartment derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) and higher or similar R-2/ICC for other parameters. In addition, the DeepMARS was significantly correlated with Look-Locker PASL for BAT (single-compartment) and CBF (two-compartment).

We use the strong correlation among features of a generic EM problem to considerably reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thus, the computational complexity, without imposing considerable errors. By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using the more recently demonstrated autoencoder technique, we redefine the conventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into a one-to-one problem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved using an analytic formulation. This approach reduces the computational complexity in solving both the forward problem (i.e., analysis) and the inverse problem (i.e., design) by orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. In addition, it provides analytic formulations that, despite their complexity, can be used to obtain intuitive understanding of the physics and dynamics of EM wave interaction with nanostructures with minimal computation requirements. As a proof-of-concept, we applied such an efficacious method to design a new class of on-demand reconfigurable optical metasurfaces based on phase-change materials (PCMs). The experimental results of the fabricated devices are in good agreement with those predicted by the proposed approach. We envision that the integration of such a DL-based technique with full-wave commercial software packages offers a powerful toolkit to facilitate the analysis, design, and optimization of the EM nanostructures as well as explaining, understanding, and predicting the observed responses in such structures.

However, collecting and annotating large datasets can be a very cumbersome and expensive task. We tackle these problems with a virtual database approach where training data is generated using computer simulations of related phenomena. Specifically, we concentrate on the following problem: can cardiovascular indices such as aortic elasticity, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and blood flow from heart be predicted continuously using wearable photoplethysmographic sensors? We simulate the blood flow using a haemodynamic model consisting of the entire human circulation. Repeated evaluation of the simulator allows us to create a database of ""virtual subjects"" with size that is only limited by available computational resources. Using this database, we train neural networks to predict the cardiac indices from photoplethysmographic signal waveform. We consider two approaches: neural networks based on predefined input features and deep convolutional neural networks taking waveform directly as the input. The performance of the methods is demonstrated using numerical examples, thus carrying out a preliminary assessment of the approaches. The results show improvements in accuracy compared with the previous methods. The improvements are especially significant with indices related to aortic elasticity and maximum blood flow.

Methods An end-to-end unrolled network is trained to reconstruct beat-to-beat 3D iNAVs acquired during a CMRA sequence. The unrolled model incorporates a nonuniform FFT operator in TensorFlow to perform the data-consistency operation, and the regularization term is learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the proximal gradient descent algorithm. The training set includes 6,000 3D iNAVs acquired from 7 different subjects and 11 scans using a variable-density (VD) cones trajectory. For testing, 3D iNAVs from 4 additional subjects are reconstructed using the unrolled model. To validate reconstruction accuracy, global and localized motion estimates from DL model-based 3D iNAVs are compared with those extracted from 3D iNAVs reconstructed with l1-ESPIRiT. Then, the high-resolution coronary MRA images motion corrected with autofocusing using the l1-ESPIRiT and DL model-based 3D iNAVs are assessed for differences. Results 3D iNAVs reconstructed using the DL model-based approach and conventional l1-ESPIRiT generate similar global and localized motion estimates and provide equivalent coronary image quality. Reconstruction with the unrolled network completes in a fraction of the time compared to CPU and GPU implementations of l1-ESPIRiT (20x and 3x speed increases, respectively). Conclusions We have developed a deep neural network architecture to reconstruct undersampled 3D non-Cartesian VD cones iNAVs. Our approach decreases reconstruction time for 3D iNAVs, while preserving the accuracy of nonrigid motion information offered by them for correction.","3D cones trajectory,convolutional neural networks,coronary MRA,non-Cartesian",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,"NONRIGID,MOTION,CORRECTION,ACCELERATED,MRI,ANGIOGRAPHY,ALGORITHM,NETWORK,SENSE",MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11414,

Higher interfacial thermal resistances (ITRs) affect the device efficiency and increase the energy consumption. Conversely, higher ITRs can enhance the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials by achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity via nanostructuring. This study proposes a dataset of descriptors for predicting the ITRs. The dataset includes two parts: one part consists of ITRs data collected from 87 experimental papers and the other part consists of the descriptors of 289 materials, which can construct over 80,000 pair-material systems for ITRs prediction. The former part is composed of over 1300 data points of metal/nonmetal, nonmetal/nonmetal, and metal/metal interfaces. The latter part consists of physical and chemical properties that are highly correlated to the ITRs. The synthesis method of the materials and the thermal measurement technique are also recorded in the dataset for further analyses. These datasets can be applied not only to ITRs predictions but also to thermal-property predictions or heat transfer on various material systems.

In total, 210 000 SM-OCT images were used for training and validating the neural network model, which we call SM-GAN. The performance of the SM-GAN method was further demonstrated using online benchmark retinal images, 3D OCT images acquired from human fingers and OCT videos of a beating fruit fly heart.

Then, on the basis of an idealized model for refrigerator data, a model of the relationships between refrigerant amount (the dependent variable) and temperature variation, refrigerator compartment temperature, freezer temperature, and other relevant parameters (independent variables) was established. A refrigeration model based on a neural network was then established for predicting the amount of refrigerant and was used to predict five unknown amounts of refrigerant from data sets. BP neural network and RBF neural network models were used to compare the prediction results and analyze the loss functions. From the results, it was concluded that the unknown amount of refrigerant was most likely to be 32.5 g.

However, due to high visual similarities between malignant (cancer) and benign (non-cancer) nodules, distinguishing malignant from malign nodules is not an easy task for a thoracic radiologist. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architecture is proposed to classify the pulmonary nodules as either benign or malignant. Due to the high variance of nodule characteristics in CT scans, such as size and shape, a multi-path, multi-scale architecture is proposed and applied in the proposed ConvNet to improve the classification performance. The multi-scale method utilizes filters with different sizes to more effectively extracted nodule features from local regions, and the multi-path architecture combines features extracted from different ConvNet layers thereby enhancing the nodule features with respect to global regions. The proposed ConvNet is trained and evaluated on the LUNGx Challenge database, and achieves a sensitivity of 0.887 and a specificity of 0.924 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.948. The proposed ConvNet achieves a 14% AUC improvement compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach. The proposed ConvNet also outperforms the other state-of-the-art ConvNets explicitly designed for pulmonary nodule classification.

In this study, we propose two types of low-cost THz-tags; one is based on the thickness variation of coated polyethylene and the other on the fingerprint spectra of reagents. In the proposed approach, machine learning, specifically a deep-learning method, is used for high-precision tag identification even with weak signals, or when the spectrum is disturbed by passing through shielding materials. We achieved almost 100% identification accuracy despite using an inexpensive tag placed under thick shielding materials with an attenuation rate of about -50 dB.

In the case of Pnma symmetry, the Q(1) and Q(2) modes are rotation, Q(Rot)(a(0) a(0) c(+)) and tilt, Q(Tilt)(a(-) a(-)c(0)), of BO6 octahedra, respectively. Here, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations along with machine learning (ML) to investigate the effects of biaxial strain on the ferroelectric and magnetic properties for hybrid improper ferroelectric (LaFeO3)(1)/(LnFeO(3))(1) superlattices (SLs), where Ln represents Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Y, Tm, and Lu. We have investigated how the polarization, magnetization, and coupling coefficients are modified subject to the external strain. The shift in energy minima in the energy landscape, which is a function of both Q(Rot) and Q(Tilt), indicates that the ferroelectric switching can be modulated upon imposing strain. Strain can change the polarization up to 16% with respect to the zero-strain value. In the case of magnetization, we observe a change in the easy axis leading to a change in the magnetic configuration from G(x)A(y)F(z) to F(x)C(y)G(z) upon tensile strain. It is impractical to compute the strain response for all possible (LnFeO(3))(1) /(Ln'/ FeO3)(1) combinations. To overcome this limitation we perform ML with DFT calculated data within a subset of all the combinations. Using machine learning, we predict the change in polarization upon strain for tolerance tau ranging from 0.844 to 0.902, which covers all the possible (LnFeO(3))(1)/(Ln'/ FeO3)(1) SL combinations.

The segmentation is the first step in creating a realistic geometry (based on mu-CT) for finite element modelling of textile composites on meso-scale. Noise in X-ray imaging data of carbon/polymer composites forms a challenge for this segmentation due to the very low X-ray contrast between fiber and polymer and unclear fiber gradients. To the best of our knowledge, segmentation of mu-CT images of carbon/polymer textile composites with low resolution data (voxel size close to the fiber diameter) remains poorly documented. In this paper, we propose and evaluate different approaches for solving the segmentation problem: variational on the one hand and deep-learning-based on the other.

In this study, a set of machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), were employed to conduct a data-driven W prospectivity modelling of the southern Jiangxi Province, China. A total of 118 known W occurrences derived from long-term exploration of this brownfield area and eight evidential layers of multi-source geoscience information related to W mineralization constituted the input datasets. This provided a data-rich foundation for training machine learning models. The optimal configuration of model parameters was trained by a grid search procedure and validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting predictive models were comprehensively assessed by a confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic curve, and success-rate curve. The modelling results indicate that the CNN model achieves the best classification performance with an accuracy of 92.38%, followed by the RF model (87.62%). In contrast, the RF model outperforms the rest of ML models in overall predictive performance and predictive efficiency. This is characterized by the highest value of area under the curve and the steepest slope of success-rate curve. The RF model was chosen as the optimal model for mineral prospectivity in this region as it is the best predictor. The prospective zones delineated by the prospectivity map occupy 9% of the study area and capture 66.95% of the known mineral occurrences. The geological interpretation of the model reveals that previously neglected Mn anomalies are significant indicators. This implies that enrichment of ore-forming material in the host rocks may play an important role in the formation process of wolframite and can represent an innovative exploration criterion for further exploration in this area.","mineral prospectivity modelling,machine learning,random forest,convolutional neural network,southern Jiangxi Province,tungsten",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Geochemistry & Geophysics,Mineralogy,Mining & Mineral Processing",,2.737,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINES,MOLYBDENITE,RE-OS,ZIRCON,U-PB,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,TUNGSTEN,DEPOSITS,RANDOM,FOREST,GOLD,REGION,SELECTION,DISTRICT",MINERALS,https://doi.org/10.3390/min10020102,
100,Mapping and Quantifying the Human-Environment Interactions in Middle Egypt Using Machine Learning and Satellite Data Fusion Techniques,12,3,,"Blasco Jose Manuel Delgado,Cian Fabio,Hanssen Ramon E.,Verstraeten Gert","Blasco JMD,Cian F,Hanssen RE,Verstraeten G",Blasco JMD,10.3390/rs12030584,Delft University of Technology,"Population growth in rural areas of Egypt is rapidly transforming the landscape. New cities are appearing in desert areas while existing cities and villages within the Nile floodplain are growing and pushing agricultural areas into the desert. To enable control and planning of the urban transformation, these rapid changes need to be mapped with high precision and frequency. Urban detection in rural areas in optical remote sensing is problematic when urban structures are built using the same materials as their surroundings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-temporal classification approach based on satellite data fusion and artificial neural networks. We applied the proposed methodology to data of the Egyptian regions of El-Minya and part of Asyut governorates collected from 1998 until 2015. The produced multi-temporal land cover maps capture the evolution of the area and improve the urban detection of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sentinel-2 Prototype Land Cover 20 m map of Africa and the Global Human Settlements Layer from the Joint Research Center (JRC). The extension of urban and agricultural areas increased over 65 km(2) and 200 km(2), respectively, during the entire period, with an accelerated increase analysed during the last period (2010-2015). Finally, we identified the trends in urban population density as well as the relationship between farmed and built-up land.","multi-temporal land cover mapping,machine learning,satellite data fusion,urban growth,land reclamation,landscape dynamics,Egypt,Google Earth Engine,AI4EO",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Geology,Remote Sensing,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,5.353,"URBAN-GROWTH,SPATIAL,STRUCTURE,CITIES,DESERT,URBANIZATION,SETTLEMENTS,CHALLENGES,AGREEMENT,SPRAWL,SPACE",REMOTE SENSING,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/3/584/pdf,
