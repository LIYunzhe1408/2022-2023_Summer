Therefore, a pan-genome approach to analyzing resistomes is necessary for thoroughly characterizing patterns of ARGs distribution within particular pathogen populations. Software tools are readily available for either ARGs identification or pan-genome analysis, but few exist to combine the two functions. Results We developed Pan Resistome Analysis Pipeline (PRAP) for the rapid identification of antibiotic resistance genes from various formats of whole genome sequences based on the CARD or ResFinder databases. Detailed annotations were used to analyze pan-resistome features and characterize distributions of ARGs. The contribution of different alleles to antibiotic resistance was predicted by a random forest classifier. Results of analysis were presented in browsable files along with a variety of visualization options. We demonstrated the performance of PRAP by analyzing the genomes of 26 Salmonella enterica isolates from Shanghai, China. Conclusions PRAP was effective for identifying ARGs and visualizing pan-resistome features, therefore facilitating pan-genomic investigation of ARGs. This tool has the ability to further excavate potential relationships between antibiotic resistance genes and their phenotypic traits.","Pan-resistome,Identification,Visualization,Machine learning",Article,"BMC, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology,Mathematical & Computational Biology",,3.629,"RESISTANCE,GENES",BMC BIOINFORMATICS,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-019-3335-y,

It was aimed to develop a methodology that helps to define damping parameters of such viscoelastic coating layers through Rayleigh damping coefficients. Machine learning tools were considered to find a prediction formula which yields Rayleigh coefficients based on thicknesses. For this purpose, several tests were conducted with different coating thicknesses on steel plates. In parallel, a great number of simulations were performed not only to make comparisons with the reference values from tests but also to feed the learning algorithms with the data sets.

To assess the sorting performance for a specific ore type, the raw materials industry currently conducts trial-and-error batch tests. In this study, a new methodology to assess the potential of hyperspectral visible to near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) sensors, combined with machine-learning routines to improve the sorting potential evaluation, is presented. The methodology is tested on two complex ores. The first is a tin ore in which cassiterite-the target mineral-is variable in grain size, heterogeneously distributed and has no diagnostic response in the VNIR-SWIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, cassiterite is intimately associated with SWIR active minerals, such as chlorite and fluorite, which can be used as proxies for its presence. The second case study consists of a copper-gold porphyry, where copper occurs mainly in chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite and chalcocite, while gold is present as inclusions in the copper minerals and in pyrite. Machine-learning techniques such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine applied to the hyperspectral data predict excellent sorting results in terms of grade and recovery. The approach can be adjusted to optimize sorting for a variety of ore types and thus could increase the attractivity of VNIR-SWIR sensor sorting in the minerals industry.","Sensor-based sorting,Hyperspectral imaging,SWIR,Machine learning,Complex ores",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mineralogy,Mining & Mineral Processing",,4.884,"METALIFERI,MOUNTAINS,MINERALS,ROMANIA",MINERALS ENGINEERING,,

Statistical models based on such heterogeneous sets of data that represent the behavior of an underlying system can be used in the monitoring, control, and optimization of the system. Unfortunately, available methods mainly focus on the scalars and profiles and do not provide a general framework for integrating different sources of data to construct a model. This article addresses the problem of estimating a process output, measured by a scalar, curve, image, or structured point cloud by a set of heterogeneous process variables such as scalar process setting, profile sensor readings, and images. We introduce a general multiple tensor-on-tensor regression approach in which each set of input data (predictor) and output measurements are represented by tensors. We formulate a linear regression model between the input and output tensors and estimate the parameters by minimizing a least square loss function. To avoid overfitting and reduce the number of parameters to be estimated, we decompose the model parameters using several basis matrices that span the input and output spaces, and provide efficient optimization algorithms for learning the basis and coefficients. Through several simulation and case studies, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results reveal the advantage of the proposed method over some benchmarks in the literature in terms of the mean square prediction error. for this article are available online.","Alternating least square algorithm,Blessing of dimensionality,Block coordinate descent algorithm,High-dimensional process modeling,Tucker decomposition",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC, 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",Mathematics,,3.217,"MULTIVARIATE,IMAGE-ANALYSIS,PREDICTION,PCA",TECHNOMETRICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00138,

However, these biological devices have relatively poor memristive switching characteristics, and thus fail to meet the requirement of neuromorphic networks for high learning accuracy. Here, memristive synapses based on carrageenan nanocomposites that possess desirable characteristics are demonstrated. These devices show highly reproducible analog resistive switching behaviors with 250 conductance states, low write noise, good write linearity, high retention of more than 10(4) s and endurance for at least 10(6) pulses. The enhanced switching properties are attributed to controllable and confined conductive filament growth, owing to the synergistic effect of self-assembled silver nanocluster doping and nanocone-shaped electrode contact. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent reliability after 1000 bending cycles. Simulations including the non-ideal factors prove that the synaptic device array can operate with an online learning accuracy of 94.3%.

However, to in silico tailor these optoelectronic properties, one must compute the conformationally dependent electronic structure over mesoscopic length and time scales. This task represents a challenging multiscale computational problem in which quantum chemistry and atomistic or coarse-grained molecular dynamics must be integrated. Recently, we introduced a methodology, called electronic coarse graining (ECG), that utilizes artificial neural networks to compute ab initio quality electronic structures using only the reduced degrees of freedom of coarse-grained models. Here, we adapt ECG to variable-molecular weight conjugated oligomers by casting the problem in the framework of sequence detection. A machine-learning (ML) architecture employing one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks is utilized to compute ground-state orbital energies, charge density distributions, and optical spectra solely from the coarse-grained model's configurational degrees of freedom. Robust molecular weight transferability for ECG is established via a A-ML approach that leverages model electronic Hamiltonians for ground and excited-state property determination. The accuracy and transferability of the ECG methodology opens the door for scalable optoelectronic property prediction in conjugated polymers directly from coarse-grained degrees of freedom.","CHARGE-TRANSPORT,MACHINE,SIMULATION,CHEMISTRY,DISORDER",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Polymer Science,,,"CHARGE-TRANSPORT,MACHINE,SIMULATION,CHEMISTRY,DISORDER",MACROMOLECULES,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601973,

The characterization of amorphous materials is especially challenging because their lack of long-range order makes it difficult to define structural metrics. In this work, we apply deep learning algorithms to accurately classify amorphous materials and characterize their structural features. Specifically, we show that convolutional neural networks and message passing neural networks can classify two-dimensional liquids and liquid-cooled glasses from molecular dynamics simulations with greater than 0.98 AUC, with no a priori assumptions about local particle relationships, even when the liquids and glasses are prepared at the same inherent structure energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that message passing neural networks surpass convolutional neural networks in this context in both accuracy and interpretability. We extract a clear interpretation of how message passing neural networks evaluate liquid and glass structures by using a self-attention mechanism. Using this interpretation, we derive three novel structural metrics that accurately characterize glass formation. The methods presented here provide a procedure to identify important structural features in materials that could be missed by standard techniques and give unique insight into how these neural networks process data.","NEURAL-NETWORKS,GLASSY,RELAXATION,DYNAMICS",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Materials Science,Physics,Polymer Science",,3.705,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,GLASSY,RELAXATION,DYNAMICS",SOFT MATTER,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04648,

The previously reported formation criterion mainly focused on solid-solution alloys, while the formation criterion was rarely established in solid-solution ceramics. To solve this problem, herein, we take a class of solid-solution ceramics, namely binary metal diboride ((MxN1-x)B-2) solid solutions, as a prototype. Through combinatorial methods including high-throughput molten salt syntheses and high-throughput first-principles calculations combined with the machine learning approach, the correlation between influential factors, including atomic size difference (delta), mixing enthalpy at 0 K and 0 Pa (Delta Hmix0K), doping condition (phi), and valence electron concentration (VEC), and the formation ability of (MxN1-x)B-2 solid solutions was first studied systematically, and then their formation criterion was well established. The results showed that the influential degree of the aforementioned four factors on the formation ability of (MxN1-x)B-2 solid solutions could be described as follows: delta > Delta Hmix0K> phi > VEC. In addition, a newly proposed parameter, beta, could well reflect the formation ability of (MxN1-x)B-2 solid solutions: when beta > 0, the single-phase (MxN1-x)B-2 solid solutions could be successfully synthesized in our work and vice versa.

This approach employs the adaptive boosting algorithm to construct a strong learner by integrating several weak learners, which can find the mapping between the input data and output data. The weak learner whose predicting error is small will have a larger weight in the entire system, thus the overall accuracy of the strong learner will be enhanced. A total of 1030 sets of concrete compressive strength tests is collected to train and test the learners, in which the concrete mixture components (e.g., coarse/fine aggregates, cement, water, additive, etc.) and the curing time are set as the input data while the compressive strength value is set as the output data. The proposed approach is validated through a 10-fold cross validation method, and reaches an average accuracy of over 95% in sense of determination coefficient. In addition, a new dataset of 103 samples for concrete compressive strength is also adopted to demonstrate the generalization power of the proposed mode. The proposed approach is also compared to some other individual machine learning techniques that are already applied in this field, e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), and shows superior advantages over these methods. Finally, the influence of some key factors in the adaptive boosting approach is also investigated, e.g., the amount of training data, the choice of weak learner, and the influence of the sensitivity and number of the input parameters. It is shown that using 80% of the total data for training can obtain acceptable prediction results and decision tree is the best choice for the weak learner in the boosting framework. Also, the importances of different input variables are obtained based on the sensitivity analysis results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With the revolution of the machine learning era, many researchers currently aim to find pathways and develop tools that may help to detect breast cancer early on in its development. We propose a novel generalized logistic dependent model with considerations of the dependence among selected biomarkers for breast cancer detection based on a set of nine biomarker predictors such as age, glucose, BMI, resistin, HOMA, MCP-1, leptin, insulin, and adiponectin. Our research findings demonstrate that the proposed model has the potential to predict breast cancer in women just based on five biomarkers, ie, glucose, age, BMI, resistin, and MCP-1. We also compare our model results to several other machine-learning modeling approaches including SVM, logistic regression, random forest, and multiple regression analyses using various training data sets (60%, 70%, 80% of all data) and all the dataset. It shows that the inclusion of the dependence among those five predictors in the proposed model is worth the extra model complexity and effort for achieving a significant accuracy prediction level of breast cancer detection in women.

However, the lack of robust inverse design approaches to identify promising candidate materials without exploring the entire design space causes a fundamental bottleneck. A general-purpose inverse design approach is presented using generative inverse design networks. This ML-based inverse design approach uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of an objective function with respect to design variables. This inverse design approach is capable of overcoming local minima traps by using backpropagation to provide rapid calculations of gradient information and running millions of optimizations with different initial values. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is adopted in the inverse design approach to improve the performance of candidate materials and reduce the amount of training data needed to do so. Compared to passive learning, the active learning strategy is capable of generating better designs and reducing the amount of training data by at least an order-of-magnitude in the case study on composite materials.

Information regarding a physical parameter termed ""adsorption energy"", which dictates the degrees of adhesion of an adsorbate on a substrate, is a primary requirement in selecting the catalyst for catalytic reactions. Both experiments and in silico modeling are extensively being used in estimating the adsorption energies, both of which are an Edisonian approach, demand plenty of resources, and are time-consuming. In this paper, employing a data-mining approach, we predict the adsorption energies of monoatomic and diatomic gases on the surfaces of many transition metals (TMs) in no time. With less than a set of 10 simple atomic features, our predictions of the adsorption energies are within a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.4 eV with the quantum many-body perturbation theory estimates, a computationally expensive method with a good experimental agreement. Based on the important features obtained from machine learning models, we construct a set of mathematical equations using the compressed sensing technique to calculate adsorption energy. We also show that the RMSE can be further minimized up to 0.10 eV using the precomputed adsorption energies obtained with the conventional exchange and correlation (XC) functional by a new set of scaling relations.","SURFACE,CATALYST,METALS",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,,"SURFACE,CATALYST,METALS",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A,,

Previous studies have explored compliant actuators using analytical and numerically derived mechanics of materials principles. However, the control of compliant gradient mechanisms frequently uses complex analytical equations combined with traditional control algorithms, making them difficult to design. To confront the design processes and computational load, herein, machine learning is used to predict errors in compliant auxetic designs based on a mathematically optimal deformation. Finite element analysis and experimental specimens validate the theoretical mechanical behavior of a specific auxetic configuration as well as demonstrate the capabilities of additive manufacturing of graded auxetic materials. Pseudorandomized images and their respective computational deformation results are used to train a regressive model and predict the deviation from optimal behavior. The model predicts the deviation from the desired behavior with a mean average percent error below 5% for the validation set.

Methods Rat brain FIDs were simulated at 9.4 T based on in vivo data (N = 11) and randomly truncated by retaining 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 (null truncation) points (denoted as tFID(8), tFID(16), horizontal ellipsis tFID(1024)). Using a U-net, 3 CNNs were individually trained (N = 40 000) in time domain only (FID to FID [FIDCNNFID]), in frequency domain only (spectrum to spectrum [specCNNspec]), and across the domains (FID to spectrum [FIDCNNspec]) to map the truncated data to their fully sampled versions. The CNNs were tested on the simulated data (N = 5000), and the CNN with the best performance was further tested on the in vivo data, for which the CNN-predicted fully sampled data were analyzed using the LCModel and the results were compared with those from the original, fully sampled data. Results The best result on the simulated data was obtained with specCNNspec, which effectively recovered the spectral details even for those input spectra that appear as a hump due to substantial FID truncation (spectra from tFID(16) and tFID(32)). Overall, its performance was significantly degraded on the in vivo data. Nonetheless, using specCNNspec, several coupled spins in addition to the major singlets can be quantified from tFID(128) with the error no larger than 10%.

Fatigue can be seen as a subjective or objective phenomenon. Subjective fatigue corresponds to a mental and cognitive event, while fatigue referred as objective is a physical phenomenon. Despite the fact that subjective fatigue is often undervalued, only a physically and mentally healthy athlete is able to achieve top performance in a discipline. Therefore, we argue that physical training programs should address the preventive assessment of both subjective and objective fatigue mechanisms in order to minimize the risk of injuries. In this context, our paper presents a machine-learning system capable of extracting individual fatigue descriptors (IFDs) from electromyographic (EMG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. Our novel approach, using two types of biosignals so that a global (mental and physical) fatigue assessment is taken into account, reflects the onset of fatigue by implementing a combination of a dimensionless (0-1) global fatigue descriptor (GFD) and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The system, based on 9 main combined features, achieves fatigue regime classification performances of 0.82 +/- 0.24, ensuring a successful preventive assessment when dangerous fatigue levels are reached. Training data were acquired in a constant work rate test (executed by 14 subjects using a cycloergometry device), where the variable under study (fatigue) gradually increased until the volunteer reached an objective exhaustion state.","HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,MUSCLE FATIGUE,LACTATE THRESHOLD,MUSCULAR FATIGUE,EXERCISE,FOREST",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Health Care Sciences & Services,,3.188,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,MUSCLE,FATIGUE,LACTATE,THRESHOLD,MUSCULAR,FATIGUE,EXERCISE,FOREST",JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING,https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/114679/1/Fatigue_Evaluation_through_Machine_Learning_and_a_Global_Fatigue_Descriptor.pdf,

For this reason, lattice constants information is vital in the design of materials for technological applications. The determination of lattice constants via experimental analysis is relatively expensive and laborious. As a result, several linear empirical models have been proposed to predict the lattice constant of crystal structures. However, the accuracies of these models are limited partly due to their failure to account for nonlinearity in the atomic parameters-lattice constant relationship. Machine learning techniques have shown excellent ability to deal with nonlinear problems in many areas of materials science; hence, they are considered suitable computation tools to study the crystal structure of materials. In this contribution, we developed a support vector regression (SVR) model to predict the lattice constant of cubic crystals of the form A(2)XY(6) (A = K, Cs, Rb, TI; X = tetravalent cation; and Y = F, Cl, Br, I). The SVR algorithm uses the ionic radii and electronegativities data of the constituent elements of A(2)XY(6) cubic crystals as model inputs. The robustness of the proposed model was demonstrated by comparing our result with an existing linear model based on 26 cubic crystal samples. The result revealed a total relative deviation of 1.757 and 2.704 for the SVR model and the existing linear equation, respectively. This result proves that the SVR model has a huge potential in the search for new materials for different applications.

This paper provides an example of this process. Starting from a recently developed (very diverse) dataset which includes 1346 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), we downselect a subset of 350 three dimensional HOIPs to a final set of four lead-free HOIPs, including CH3NH3SnI3, HC(NH2)(2)SnI3, NH2NH3SnI3, and NH2(CH2)(3)SnI3, in which the first two were experimentally synthesized and the others remain hypothetical. Using first-principles based computational methods, we show that these HOIPs have preferable electronic band structures and carrier effective mass, good optical properties, and high spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency. Compared to the experimental data, we find that state-of-the-art numerical methods can predict the electronic and optical properties fairly well, while the current model for the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency is inadequate for capturing the power conversion efficiency of a solar absorber. We suggest that the HOIP dataset should be expanded to include larger structures of HOIPs, thereby being more useful for future data-mining and machine-learning approaches.","TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS,METAL-HALIDE PEROVSKITES,EFFICIENCY,TIN,APPROXIMATION,ABSORBER",Article,"AIP Publishing, 1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA","Chemistry,Physics",,3.166,"TOTAL-ENERGY,CALCULATIONS,METAL-HALIDE,PEROVSKITES,EFFICIENCY,TIN,APPROXIMATION,ABSORBER",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,

Ali","Saxena S,Khan TS,Jalid F,Ramteke M,Haider MA",Khan TS; Haider MA,10.1039/c9ta07651d,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System),"The advent of machine learning (ML) techniques in solving problems related to materials science and chemical engineering is driving expectations to give faster predictions of material properties. For heterogeneous catalysis applications, relying on the age-old Sabatier principle, an ab initio in silico high throughput screening of catalyst materials is envisaged, wherein ML based methods show potential to significantly reduce the experimental as well as computation cost. The availability of ML algorithms (in open source libraries like Scikit-Learn) and materials database (like CatApp and Materials Project) further augments this realization. By using these resources, ML models are developed to predict the binding energies of oxygen and carbon on bimetallic alloys and Cu-based single atom alloys (SAAs) using the features of metals that are readily available in the periodic table. Several ML models for predicting oxygen binding energy for AA terminated A3B alloys are analysed and gradient boosting regression (GBR) is observed to give superior performance with a root mean square error of 0.31 eV in the test. In addition, GBR based ML models are demonstrated to predict the oxygen and carbon binding energies of AB terminated A3B alloys with a test error of 0.38 eV and 0.35 eV respectively. The binding energy of oxygen and carbon on Cu-based SAAs is predicted with a test error of 0.36 eV and 0.37 eV respectively. Moreover, the computational time for predicting the binding energy using ML is 0.0006 s on a dual-core laptop which is significantly less than the time required for DFT calculations. DFT and ML calculated carbon and oxygen binding energies for the bimetallic A3B alloys are further used in an ab initio microkinetic model to calculate the turn over frequency (TOF) for ethanol decomposition and nonoxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The TOFs over bimetallic alloys obtained using the ML calculated binding energies follow the same trend as that obtained using the DFT energies, with the TOF values being the same or within an order of magnitude range. This shows that catalyst screening using binding energy as a descriptor can be performed using ML models, bypassing time and resources consuming DFT calculations. This is likely to speed up the process of novel catalyst discovery.","DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,STATE SCALING RELATIONS,BRONSTED-EVANS-POLANYI,AMMONIA-SYNTHESIS,ADSORPTION ENERGIES,SURFACE-CHEMISTRY,CATALYST DESIGN,CO METHANATION,METAL",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Energy & Fuels,Materials Science",,11.995,"DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL,THEORY,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,STATE,SCALING,RELATIONS,BRONSTED-EVANS-POLANYI,AMMONIA-SYNTHESIS,ADSORPTION,ENERGIES,SURFACE-CHEMISTRY,CATALYST,DESIGN,CO,METHANATION,METAL",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A,,

A deep stacked convolutional autoencoder is designed by combining the autoencoder and the deconvolution network which conjointly reduces noisy artifacts and improves image details in mammogram. The proposed SSDAE model takes large noisy mammogram image patches as input and extracts relevant features from target batches. The suggested model can extract relevant features and reduce the dimensionality through sparsity property of the image data while preserving the key features that have been applied to restore image data in feature space. In order to reconstruct a deafening mammogram, the proposed model is carried out through a patched base training on samples to suppress noise thereby preserving structural details in mammography imaging. Experimental results authenticate that the suggested SSDAE model outplays a number of state-of-the-art methods for both X-ray mammogram and ultrasonographic mammogram.

Moreover, a variational autoencoder-based data generator is trained with small sample sets to expand the size of the training data set. A comparative study involving the proposed method and traditional models is performed. In addition, a filtering rule based on the R2 score is proposed and applied in the training process of the MNNE, and this approach has a beneficial effect on the prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Findings A comparative study involving the proposed method and traditional models is performed.

Only part of the ROC curve and AUC are informative however when they are used with imbalanced data. Hence, alternatives to the AUC have been proposed, such as the partial AUC and the area under the precision-recall curve. However, these alternatives cannot be as fully interpreted as the AUC, in part because they ignore some information about actual negatives. Methods We derive and propose a new concordant partial AUC and a new partial c statistic for ROC data-as foundational measures and methods to help understand and explain parts of the ROC plot and AUC. Our partial measures are continuous and discrete versions of the same measure, are derived from the AUC and c statistic respectively, are validated as equal to each other, and validated as equal in summation to whole measures where expected. Our partial measures are tested for validity on a classic ROC example from Fawcett, a variation thereof, and two real-life benchmark data sets in breast cancer: the Wisconsin and Ljubljana data sets. Interpretation of an example is then provided. Results Results show the expected equalities between our new partial measures and the existing whole measures. The example interpretation illustrates the need for our newly derived partial measures. Conclusions The concordant partial area under the ROC curve was proposed and unlike previous partial measure alternatives, it maintains the characteristics of the AUC. The first partial c statistic for ROC plots was also proposed as an unbiased interpretation for part of an ROC curve. The expected equalities among and between our newly derived partial measures and their existing full measure counterparts are confirmed. These measures may be used with any data set but this paper focuses on imbalanced data with low prevalence.

This study investigates a machine learning algorithm and transfer learning techniques for Spectral CT imaging of K-edge contrast agents using simulated and experimental measurements. Methods A feed forward multilayer perceptron was implemented and trained on data acquired using a step wedge phantom containing acrylic, aluminum, and gadolinium materials. The neural network estimator was evaluated by scanning a rod phantom with varying dilutions of gadolinium oxide nanoparticles and by scanning a rat leg specimen with injected nanoparticles on a bench-top photon-counting computed tomography system. The algorithm decomposed each spectral projection measurement into path lengths of acrylic and aluminum and mass lengths of gadolinium. Each basis material sinogram was reconstructed into basis material images using filtered backprojection. Machine learning techniques of data standardization, transfer learning from aggregated pixel data, and transfer learning from simulations were investigated to improve image quality. The algorithm was compared to a previously published empirical method based on a linear approximation and calibration error look-up tables. Results The combined transfer learning techniques did not improve quantification in the rod phantom and provided only a small qualitative improvement in ring artifacts. Transfer learning from aggregated pixel data and from simulations improved the qualitative image quality of the rat specimen, for which the calibration data were limited. Transfer learning from aggregated pixel data and simulations estimated 3.26, 6.26, and 12.45 mg/mL Gd concentrations compared to true 2.72, 5.44, and 10.88 mg/mL concentrations in the rod phantom. Additionally, the neural networks were able to separate the soft tissue, bone, and gadolinium nanoparticles of the ex vivo rat leg specimen into the different basis images.

Lastly, the forecasting results of each component are aggregated to formulate an ultimate forecasting output for the original price series. To investigate the forecasting performance of the proposed model, extensive experiments have been executed using the LME (London Metal Exchange) daily future prices of Zinc, Copper and Aluminum, and other six state-of-the-art methods are included for comparison.

The label-free hyperspectral microscope imaging (HMI) method, which provides spectral ""fingerprints"" information of bacterial cells, was employed to classify serogroups at the cellular level. In spectral analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) method and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) method were conducted to extract principal spectral features for classification task. Based on these features, multiple classifiers including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM) and soft-max regression (SR) methods were evaluated. Different sizes of datasets were also tested in search for the suitable classification models. Among the results, SAE-based classification models performed better than PCA-based models, achieving classification accuracy of SAE-LDA (93.5%), SAE-SVM (94.9%) and SAE-SR (94.6%), respectively. In contrast, classification results of PCA-based methods such as PCA-LDA, PCA-SVM and PCA-SR were only 75.5%, 85.7% and 77.1%, respectively. The results also suggested the increasing number of training samples have positive effects on classification models. Taking advantage of increasing dataset, the SAE-SR classification model finally performed better than others with average accuracy of 94.9% in classifying STEC serogroups. Specifically, O103 serogroup was classified with the highest accuracy of 97.4%, followed by O111 (96.5%), O26 (95.3%), O121 (95%), O145 (92.9%) and O45 (92.4%), respectively.

To understand these properties, it's necessary to characterize the chemical ordering and identify order-disorder transitions through efficient simulation and modeling of thermodynamics. In this study, a robust data-driven framework based on Bayesian approaches is proposed for the accurate and efficient prediction of configurational energy of high entropy alloys. The recently proposed effective pair interaction (EPI) model with ensemble sampling is used to map the configuration and its corresponding energy. Given limited data calculated by first-principles calculations, Bayesian regularized regression not only offers an accurate and stable prediction but also effectively quantifies the uncertainties associated with EPI parameters. Compared with the arbitrary truncation of model complexity, we further conduct a physical feature selection to identify the truncation of coordination shells in EPI model using Bayesian information criterion. The results achieve efficient and robust performance in predicting the configurational energy, particularly given small data. The developed methodology is applied to study a series of refractory HEAs, i.e. NbMoTaW, NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWTi where it is demonstrated how dataset size affects the confidence when data is sparse.

Then, a Multi-objective Bacterial Colony Optimization algorithm (MOBCO) incorporating concepts of multi-swarm, topology, personal best and global best, named Multi-objective BCO with ring topology (MORBCO), is designed to handle the resulting problem. The extension of standard MOBCO to the MORBCO involves the addition of three specialized strategies: global chemotaxis operation, elite reproduction strategy and personal best archive with neighborhood communication mechanism. In order to test the performance of the MORBCO, benchmark tests are performed and compared with traditional MOBCO and three other well-known multi-objective algorithms first. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm can outperform other rivals and efficiently solve a variety of multi-objective problems in most of cases. Subsequently, MORBCO and two best performing algorithms from the previous test are applied to three instances generated by the proposed model. Judging by quality and diversity of obtained non-dominant solutions, we find that MORBCO has superior performance, especially for large instances of the container terminal problem.","Bacterial colony optimization algorithm,Container terminals,Integrated scheduling optimization,Multi-objective optimization",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,1.436,"BERTH-ALLOCATION,QUAY,CRANE,EVOLUTIONARY,ALGORITHMS",NATURAL COMPUTING,,

Ideally, network performance should be optimized by drawing the training and testing data from the same domain. In practice, however, large datasets comprising hundreds of subjects scanned under a common protocol are rare. The goal of this study is to introduce a transfer-learning approach to address the problem of data scarcity in training deep networks for accelerated MRI. Methods Neural networks were trained on thousands (upto 4 thousand) of samples from public datasets of either natural images or brain MR images. The networks were then fine-tuned using only tens of brain MR images in a distinct testing domain. Domain-transferred networks were compared to networks trained directly in the testing domain. Network performance was evaluated for varying acceleration factors (4-10), number of training samples (0.5-4k), and number of fine-tuning samples (0-100). Results The proposed approach achieves successful domain transfer between MR images acquired with different contrasts (T-1- and T-2-weighted images) and between natural and MR images (ImageNet and T-1- or T-2-weighted images). Networks obtained via transfer learning using only tens of images in the testing domain achieve nearly identical performance to networks trained directly in the testing domain using thousands (upto 4 thousand) of images. Conclusion The proposed approach might facilitate the use of neural networks for MRI reconstruction without the need for collection of extensive imaging datasets.","accelerated MRI,compressive sensing,deep learning,image reconstruction,transfer learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,4.616,IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02615,

However, CBCT images suffer from low soft-tissue contrast, noise, and artifacts compared to conventional fan-beam CT images. Therefore, it is essential to improve the image quality of CBCT. Methods In this paper, we propose a synthetic approach to translate CBCT images with deep neural networks. Our method requires only unpaired and unaligned CBCT images and planning fan-beam CT (PlanCT) images for training. The CBCT images and PlanCT images may be obtained from other patients as long as they are acquired with the same scanner settings. Once trained, three-dimensionally reconstructed CBCT images can be directly translated into high-quality PlanCT-like images. Results We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with images obtained from 20 prostate patients, and provide a statistical and visual comparison. The image quality of the translated images shows substantial improvement in voxel values, spatial uniformity, and artifact suppression compared to those of the original CBCT. The anatomical structures of the original CBCT images were also well preserved in the translated images.

We investigated the incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes using antidiabetic drugs from three classes, which were sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is). Materials and methods: We compared the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among these drugs and developed a machine learning model for predicting MI in patients without prior heart disease. We analyzed US health plan data for patients without prior MI or insulin therapy who were aged >= 40 years at initial prescription and had not received oral antidiabetic drugs for >= 6 months previously. After developing a machine learning model to predict MI, proportional hazards analysis of MI incidence was conducted using the risk obtained with this model and the drug classes as explanatory variables. Results: We analyzed 199,116 patients (mean age: years), comprising 110,278 (58.6) prescribed DPP-4is, 43,538 (55.1) prescribed GLP-1RAs and 45,300 (55.3) prescribed SGLT-2is. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed higher precision of machine learning over logistic regression analysis. Proportional hazards analysis by machine learning revealed a significantly lower risk of MI with SGLT-2is or GLP-1RAs than DPP-4is (hazard ratio: 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.91, p = .0004 vs. 0.63, 0.56-0.72, p < .0001). MI risk was also significantly lower with GLP-1RAs than SGLT-2is (0.77, 0.66-0.90, p = .001). Limitations: All patients analyzed were covered by US commercial health plans, so information on patients aged >= 65 years was limited and the socioeconomic background may have been biased. Also, the observation period differed among the three classes of drugs due to differing release dates. Conclusions: Machine learning analysis suggested the risk of MI was 37% lower for type 2 diabetes patients without prior MI using GLP-1RAs versus DPP-4is, while the risk was 19% lower for SGLT-2is versus DPP-4is.","Cardiovascular disease,machine learning,myocardial infarction,oral antidiabetic drugs,type 2 diabetes",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","General & Internal Medicine,Research & Experimental Medicine",,2.491,"CARDIOVASCULAR,OUTCOMES,MORTALITY,RISK",CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION,,

It may cause many complicated disease like stroke, kidney failure, heart attack, etc. About 422 million people were affected by diabetes disease in worldwide in 2014. The figure will be reached 642 million in 2040. The main objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based system for predicting diabetic patients. Materials and methods Logistic regression (LR) is used to identify the risk factors for diabetes disease based on p value and odds ratio (OR). We have adopted four classifiers like naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), Adaboost (AB), and random forest (RF) to predict the diabetic patients. Three types of partition protocols (K2, K5, and K10) have also adopted and repeated these protocols into 20 trails. Performances of these classifiers are evaluated using accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC). Results We have used diabetes dataset, conducted in 2009-2012, derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The dataset consists of 6561 respondents with 657 diabetic and 5904 controls. LR model demonstrates that 7 factors out of 14 as age, education, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, direct cholesterol, and total cholesterol are the risk factors for diabetes. The overall ACC of ML-based system is 90.62%. The combination of LR-based feature selection and RF-based classifier gives 94.25% ACC and 0.95 AUC for K10 protocol. Conclusion The combination of LR and RF-based classifier performs better.

Accuracy of the estimation process underpins corporate legitimacy. Importantly, local improvements in estimation process can translate into improvements in mine planning, and ultimately better-informed investment decisions. Traditionally, resource models use estimation parameters that are based on statistical patterns and spatial variability within a geologically informed volume constraint ('the domain'). The variogram, block size analysis and determination of search parameters are assessed from the data within the geologically delineated domain. The set of parameters so determined are then applied to every estimation block within the domain, and the block model is then provided to the mine planner for optimisation. The mine planning optimisation process responds to each block grades. The focus of the mine planning process is to minimise ore loss and mining dilution and so provide the best possible opportunity for the orebody and its value to be realised. However, overly smooth grade models restrict a mine planner's ability to achieve the best outcome for the project and for the asset owners. Despite the estimation of every block in a resource model being conducted independently of every other block in the model, Resource Geologists continue to generalise parameters across a domain of blocks. This paper challenges the global parameter approach, and instead seeks a more locally contextual set of parameters. This challenge is in keeping with innovations across industries and around the globe that seek real time bespoke responsiveness built on big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence. There are many steps 'going local' in estimation. This paper focusses on two aspects: firstly, optimising sample selection or search neighbourhood parameters (Local Kriging Neighbourhood Optimisation), and, secondly, addressing topcuts in response to those samples selected. A case study is presented to illustrate the process and demonstrate the improvements. The paper closes with a call for Resource Geologists to improve local as well as global accuracy of their resource models so that mine planners can respond to the knowledge and information available at a local scale in the grade estimation block model in their planning processes.","Kriging,Kriging Efficiency,Slop of Regression,Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis,Topcutting",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Mining & Mineral Processing,,,,MINERAL PROCESSING AND EXTRACTIVE METALLURGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY,,
67,Ranking Importance of Topographical Surface and Subsurface Parameters on Paludification in Northern Boreal Forests Using Very High Resolution Remotely Sensed Datasets,12,2,,"Laamrani Ahmed,Valeria Osvaldo","Laamrani A,Valeria O",Laamrani A,10.3390/su12020577,Mohammed VI Polytechnic University,"The accumulation of organic material on top of the mineral soil over time (a process called paludification) is common in Northern Boreal coniferous forests. This natural process leads to a marked decrease in forest productivity overtime. Topography both at the surface of the forest floor (i.e., above ground) and the subsurface (i.e., top of mineral soil which is underground) is known to play a critical role in the paludification process. Until recently, the availability of more accurate topographic information regarding the surface and subsurface was a limiting factor for land management and modeling of spatial organic layer thickness (OLT) variability, a proxy for paludification. However so far, no research has assessed which of these two topographic variables has the greatest influence on paludification. This study aims to assess which topographic variable (surface or subsurface) better explains paludification, using high-resolution remote sensing technology (i.e., Light Detection and Ranging: LiDAR and Ground Penetrating Radar: GPR). To this end, field soil measurements were made in over 1614 sites distributed throughout the reference Valrennes Experimental site in Canadian northern coniferous forests. Then, a machine learning model (i.e., Random Forest, RF) was implemented to rank a set of selected predictor topographic variables (i.e., slope, aspect, mean curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, and topographic wetness index) using the Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) index as an indicator of importance. Results showed that overall 83% of the overall variance was explained by the RF selected model, while the derived subsurface topography predictors had the lowest MDGs for predicting paludification. On the other hand, the surface slope predictor had the highest MDGs and better explained paludification. This finding would be particularly useful for implanting sustainable management strategies based on the surface variables of paludified northern boreal forests. This study has also highlighted the potential of LiDAR data to provide surface topographic spatial detail information for planning and optimizing forest management activities in paludified boreal forests. This is even of great importance when we know that LiDAR variables are easier to obtain compared to GPR derived variables (subsurface topographic variables).","random forest model,forest productivity,forest management,Clay Belt,LiDAR,mineral soil,Subsurface Digital Elevation Model (SUB-DEM),Digital Terrain Model (DTM)",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,3.473,"ORGANIC,LAYER,SOIL-MOISTURE,PRODUCTIVITY,MANAGEMENT,THICKNESS,DYNAMICS,CANADA,FIRE",SUSTAINABILITY,https://depositum.uqat.ca/id/eprint/1093/1/laamrani-valeria_sus_janv2020.pdf,

Generally, this parameter is directly measured in laboratory in which complicated test tools and core specimens with high quality and fitting dimensions are needed. As an alternative, back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques are used to estimate E in this study. For this purpose, measured data from the Azad and Bakhtiary dam sites in Iran are considered for models construction and evaluation. On the basis of minimum error index, neural networks with architecture 8-5-7-1 and 8-12-1 are found as the optimum networks for BPNN and RBFNN models, respectively. Comparing the performance of developed models is conducted using the five statistical indices. Accordingly, it is found that the performance of RBFNN model is somewhat better than BPNN model and both more realistic than the MLR mode. Also, the results of RBFNN and BPNN models gave higher conformity with the actual dada compared to the MLR model. Finally, parametric study shows that inputs P-wave velocity and unconfined compressive strength are the most effective variables and depth of coring and porosity are the least effective ones on the elastic modulus in the BPNN and RBFNN models, respectively. The main conclusion of this study is developing the new models with high accuracy and satisfied confidence in which all of the possible effective parameters were considered in estimation of the elastic modulus.","Elastic modulus,neural network,back propagation,radial basis function,multiple linear regression",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Engineering,,,"UNIAXIAL,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORK,YOUNGS,MODULUS,INTACT,ROCKS,ENGINEERING,PROPERTIES,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,VELOCITY,CAPACITY,HARDNESS,MODEL",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING,,

Methods and Materials Twenty-five head-and-neck patients received magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) (CTaligned) scans on the same day with the same immobilization. Fivefold cross validation was used with all of the MR-CT pairs to train a neural network to generate synthetic CTs from MR images. Twenty-four of 25 patients also had a separate CT without immobilization (CTnon-aligned) and were used for testing. CTnon-aligned's were deformed to the synthetic CT, and compared to CTnon-aligned registered to MR. The same registrations were performed from MR to CTnon-aligned and from synthetic CT to CTnon-aligned. All registrations used B-splines for modeling the deformation, and mutual information for the objective. Results were evaluated using the 95% Hausdorff distance among spinal cord contours, landmark error, inverse consistency, and Jacobian determinant of the estimated deformation fields. Results When large initial rigid misalignment is present, registering CT to MRI-derived synthetic CT aligns the cord better than a direct registration. The average landmark error decreased from 9.8 +/- 3.1 mm in MR -> CTnon-aligned to 6.0 +/- 2.1 mm in CTsynth -> CTnon-aligned deformable registrations. In the CT to MR direction, the landmark error decreased from 10.0 +/- 4.3 mm in CTnon-aligned -> MR deformable registrations to 6.6 +/- 2.0 mm in CTnon-aligned -> CTsynth deformable registrations. The Jacobian determinant had an average value of 0.98. The proposed method also demonstrated improved inverse consistency over the direct method.

The sonographers primarily concern about the location of the artery in B-mode ultrasound images. Localization using manual methods is tedious and time-consuming and also may lead to some errors. On the other hand, automated approaches are more objective and can provide the localization of the artery at near real time. Above arterial parameters may be determined after localization of the artery in real time.
A novel method of localization of common carotid artery (CCA) transverse section is presented in this work. The method is known as fast region convolutional neural network (FRCNN)-based localization method and is designed using a stack of three layers viz. convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and pooling layers. These organized layers constitute a region proposal network (RPN) and an object class detection network (OCDN). We obtain an outcome as a bounding box along with a score of prediction around the cross-section of the CCA.
B-mode ultrasound image database of CCA is split into training and testing set, to accomplish this, three partition methods K = 2, 5, and 10 are used in our work. The training is extended for 30, 200, and 2000 epochs in order to achieve fine-tuned features from the convolutional neural network. After 2000 epochs, we obtain 95% validation accuracy; however, mean of the accuracies up to 2000 epochs is 89.36% for K = 10 partitions protocol (training 90%, testing 10%).

Accurate determination of these events is thus an essential component of 3D motion recordings processing. Several methods have been developed for the automatic detection of these events (based on the heuristics of 3D marker position, velocity and acceleration), however the results may be inaccurate due to the high variability that is intrinsic to pathological gait. For this reason, gait events are still commonly determined manually, which is a tedious process. Here we propose a new application (DeepEvent) of a long short term memory recurrent neural network for the automatic detection of gait events. The 3D position and velocity of the markers on the heel, toe and lateral malleolus were used by the network to determine FS and FO. The method was developed from 10526 FS and 9375 FO from 226 children. DeepEvent predicted FS within 5.5 ms and FO within 10.7 ms of the gold standard (automatic determination using force platform data) and was more accurate than common heuristic marker trajectory-based methods proposed in the literature and another deep learning method.
A sensitivity analysis showed that DeepEvent mainly used the toe and heel markers (z-axis (longitudinal) position and velocity) at the beginning and end of gait cycle to predict FS, and the toe marker (x-axis (anterior/posterior) velocity and z-axis position and velocity) at around 60% of the gait cycle to predict FO.

Photo-induced ICT is characterized by structural reorganizations, which allows the molecule to adapt to the new electronic density distribution. Herein, we discuss recent photophysical advances combined with recent progresses in the computational chemistry of photoactive molecular ensembles. We focus the discussion on femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS) enabling us to follow the transition from a Locally Excited (LE) state to the ICT and to understand how the environment polarity influences radiative and non-radiative decay mechanisms. In many cases, the charge transfer transition is accompanied by structural rearrangements, such as the twisting or molecule planarization. The possibility of an accurate prediction of the charge-transfer occurring in complex molecules and molecular materials represents an enormous advantage in guiding new molecular and materials design. We briefly report on recent advances in ultrafast multidimensional spectroscopy, in particular, Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES), in unraveling the ICT nature of push-pull molecular systems. A theoretical description at the atomistic level of photo-induced molecular transitions can predict with reasonable accuracy the properties of photoactive molecules. In this framework, the review includes a discussion on the advances from simulation and modeling, which have provided, over the years, significant information on photoexcitation, emission, charge-transport, and decay pathways. Density Functional Theory (DFT) coupled with the Time-Dependent (TD) framework can describe electronic properties and dynamics for a limited system size. More recently, Machine Learning (ML) or deep learning approaches, as well as free-energy simulations containing excited state potentials, can speed up the calculations with transferable accuracy to more complex molecules with extended system size. A perspective on combining ultrafast spectroscopy with molecular simulations is foreseen for optimizing the design of photoactive compounds with tunable properties.","ultrafast spectroscopy,push-pull molecules,DFT,TD-DFT,transient absorption spectroscopy,ICT,two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy,machine learning,molecular simulations",Review,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Chemistry",,4.588,"GAUSSIAN-BASIS,SETS,POTENTIAL-ENERGY,SURFACES,EXCITED-STATE,DYNAMICS,TD-DFT,PHOTOPHYSICAL,PROPERTIES,TRANSFER,EXCITATIONS,SOLVATION,DYNAMICS,2D-IR,SPECTROSCOPY,STRUCTURAL-CHANGES,ELECTRON-TRANSFER",MOLECULES,https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/2/430/pdf,

For the smart manufacturing, the intelligent prediction systems have been gradually developing for processing of CNC machine tools. Recently, many artificial intelligent algorithms of machine learning have been widely applied for forecasting and decision making in intelligent manufacturing. In general, the cutting tool wear in manufacturing of CNC machine tool plays a major role for a high quality and an efficient operation, but it is very difficult to diagnose and prognoses the tool wear for tool life due to many cutting parameters. Therefore, the study investigates the iterative gradient convergences of backpropagation neural network (BNN) algorithm for prediction tool life with analytics of its convergence and stability. The estimative methods of iterative convergences include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), momentum, adaptive gradient (Adagrad), adaptive delta (Adadelta), and adaptive moment (ADAM) algorithms. In BNN prediction model, the data inputs are the cutting speed, feed rate, and totalmaterial removal volume and data output is tool wear measured from the microscope. Results showed that the tool wear curves at different cutting conditions can be predicted and trained using BNN model for intelligent manufacturing. In addition, the convergence of ADAM gradient for the tool wear in all cases is the best prediction for the BNN model. However, it is worth to notice that the momentum gradient is faster training speed to converge to a constant error at fewer iteration numbers.","Tool wear,Convergence,Intelligentmanufacturing,Prediction,Neural network",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Automation & Control Systems,Engineering",,3.32,BEHAVIOR,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,,

Use of machine learning is rising in the prediction of patient outcomes. Machine learning may also be able to enhance and augment anesthesia clinical procedures such as airway management. In this study, we sought to develop a machine learning algorithm that could classify vocal cords and tracheal airway anatomy real-time during video laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy as well as compare the performance of three novel convolutional networks for detecting vocal cords and tracheal rings. Methods Following institutional approval, a clinical dataset of 775 video laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy videos was used. The dataset was divided into two categories for use for training and testing. We used three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNet, Inception and MobileNet. Backpropagation and a mean squared error loss function were used to assess accuracy as well as minimize bias and variance. Following training, we assessed transferability using the generalization error of the CNN, sensitivity and specificity, average confidence error, outliers, overall confidence percentage, and frames per second for live video feeds. After the training was complete, 22 models using 0 to 25,000 steps were generated and compared. Results The overall confidence of classification for the vocal cords and tracheal rings for ResNet, Inception and MobileNet CNNs were as follows: 0.84, 0.78, and 0.64 for vocal cords, respectively, and 0.69, 0.72, 0.54 for tracheal rings, respectively. Transfer learning following additional training resulted in improved accuracy of ResNet and Inception for identifying the vocal cords (with a confidence of 0.96 and 0.93 respectively). The two best performing CNNs, ResNet and Inception, achieved a specificity of 0.985 and 0.971, respectively, and a sensitivity of 0.865 and 0.892, respectively. Inception was able to process the live video feeds at 10 FPS while ResNet processed at 5 FPS. Both were able to pass a feasibility test of identifying vocal cords and tracheal rings in a video feed. Conclusions We report the development and evaluation of a CNN that can identify and classify airway anatomy in real time. This neural network demonstrates high performance. The availability of artificial intelligence may improve airway management and bronchoscopy by helping to identify key anatomy real time. Thus, potentially improving performance and outcomes during these procedures. Further, this technology may theoretically be extended to the settings of airway pathology or airway management in the hands of experienced providers.

In this work we demonstrate how feature importance, as identified by a gradient boosting tree regressor, uncovers the strong dependence of the metal hydride equilibrium H-2 pressure on a volume-based destriptor that can be computed from just the elemental composition of the intermetallic alloy. Elucidation of this simple structure-property relationship is valid across a range of compositions, metal substitutions, and structural classes exhibited by intermetallic hydrides. This permits rational targeting of novel intermetallics for high-pressure hydrogen storage (low-stability hydrides) by their descriptor values, and we predict a known intermetallic to form a low-stability hydride (as confirmed by density functional theory calculations) that has not yet been experimentally investigated.","HYDROGEN-STORAGE MATERIALS,METAL-HYDRIDES,HEAT,ABSORPTION,PREDICTION,DISCOVERY",Article,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,7.643,"HYDROGEN-STORAGE,MATERIALS,METAL-HYDRIDES,HEAT,ABSORPTION,PREDICTION,DISCOVERY",JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/3614979/accepted.pdf,

In this paper, we review various active learning methods for manifold data, where the intrinsic manifold structure of data is also incorporated into the active learning query strategies. In addition, we present a new manifold-based active learning algorithm for Gaussian process classification. This new method uses a data-dependent kernel derived from a semi-supervised model that considers both labeled and unlabeled data. The method performs a regularization on the smoothness of the fitted function with respect to both the ambient space and the manifold where the data lie. The regularization parameter is treated as an additional kernel (covariance) parameter and estimated from the data, permitting adaptation of the kernel to the given dataset manifold geometry. Comparisons with other AL methods for manifold data show faster learning performance in our empirical experiments.

Study variables included the reason for admission, indication for delivery, optimal steroid use, gestational age, and other potential prognostic factors. Using stepwise multivariable analysis, the only two variables independently associated with serious neonatal morbidity were gestational age and the presence of suspected intrauterine growth restriction as a reason for admission. This finding was surprising given the beneficial effects of antenatal steroids and hazards associated with some causes of preterm birth. Multivariable logistic regression techniques have limitations. Without testing for multiple interactions, linear regression will identify only individual factors with the strongest independent relationship to the outcome for the entire study group. There may not be a single ?best set? of risk factors or one set that applies equally well to all subgroups. In contrast, machine learning techniques find the most predictive groupings of factors based on their frequency and strength of association, with no attempt to identify independence and no assumptions about linear relationships. Objective: To determine if machine learning techniques would identify specific clusters of conditions with different probability estimates for severe neonatal morbidity and to compare these findings to those based on the original multivariable analysis. Materials and methods: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in a multicenter, prospective study on all admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit between 2013 and 2015 in 10 hospitals. We included all patients with a singleton, stillborn, or live newborns, with a gestational age between 23 0/7 and 31 6/7 week. The composite endpoint, severe neonatal morbidity, defined by the presence of any of five outcomes: death, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and ?28 days on ventilator, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), or stage III necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), was present in 238 of the 1039 study patients. We studied five explanatory variables: maternal age, parity, gestational age, admission reason, and status with respect to antenatal steroid administration. We concentrated on Classification and Regression Trees because the resulting structure defines clusters of risk factors that often bear resemblance to clinical reasoning. Model performance was measured using area under the receiver?operator characteristic curves (AUC) based on 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Results: A hybrid technique using a combination of logistic regression and Classification and Regression Trees had a mean cross-validated AUC of 0.853. A selected point on its receiver?operator characteristic (ROC) curve corresponding to a sensitivity of 81% was associated with a specificity of 76%. Rather than a single curve representing the general relationship between gestational age and severe morbidity, this technique found seven clusters with distinct curves. Abnormal fetal testing as a reason for admission with or without growth restriction and incomplete steroid administration would place a 20-year-old patient on the highest risk curve. Conclusions: Using a relatively small database and a few simple factors known before birth it is possible to produce a more tailored estimate of the risk for severe neonatal morbidity on which clinicians can superimpose their medical judgment, experience, and intuition.","Artificial intelligence,machine learning,neonatal death,prediction",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Obstetrics & Gynecology,,2.246,"HEART-RATE,PATTERNS,PREMATURE,RUPTURE,INFANTS,PREDICTION,MORTALITY,OUTCOMES",JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,,

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.",,Journal Article,,,,,,,,

Due to the difficulty of manual rule design, these methods are limited to detect certain simple locomotion modes. Machine learning (ML) based methods can perform classification on a large number of classes without manual rule design and recent research has explored several ML methods for locomotion mode classification. However, current ML based methods for locomotion mode detection use classical methods that require use of feature engineering to achieve acceptable accuracies. Additionally, current ML strategies only classify when certain motion events are detected. This strategy, while computationally efficient could result in misclassifications affecting large sections of motion recognition. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning based method for locomotion mode detection that eliminates the need for feature engineering and classifies at a fixed sample rate. This paper introduces a new metric called confidence index and proposes a strategy for tuning confidence index thresholds to achieve a stable intent recognition and overall accuracy of greater than 95% on a publicly available benchmark dataset.","Lower limb wearable robots,Intent recognition,Machine learning,Locomotion mode",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering,Robotics",,,RECOGNITION,,,

The input to the architectures are features in the time domain, which have been derived either from one inertial measurement unit placed on the upper right leg of ten healthy subjects, or two inertial measurement units placed on both the upper and lower right leg of ten healthy subjects. The study shows that a WaveNet, i.e., a full convolutional neural network, achieves a peak F1-score of 87.17% in the case of one IMU, and a peak of 97.88% in the case of two IMUs, with a 5-fold cross-validation.","LIMB,RECOGNITION",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering,Robotics",,,"LIMB,RECOGNITION",,https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/160166256/09341649.pdf,

We leverage GelSight sensors to convert the problem of surface roughness measurement into a vision classification problem. By combining GelSight sensors with Optitrack positioning systems we attempt to develop an accurate spatial mapping of surface roughness that can compare to human touch, the current state of the art for large scale manufacturing. To perform the classification, we propose the use of Bayesian neural networks in conjunction with uncertainty-aware prediction. We compare the sensor and network with a human baseline for both absolute and relative texture classification. To establish a baseline, we collected performance data from humans on their ability to classify materials into 60, 120, and 180 grit sanded pine boards. Our results showed that the probabilistic network performs at the level of human touch for absolute and relative classifications. Using the Bayesian approach enables establishing a confidence bound on our prediction. We were able to integrate the sensor with Optitrack to provide a spatial map of sanding grit applied to pine boards. From this result, we can conclude that GelSight with Bayesian neural networks can learn accurate representations for sanding, and could be a significant enabling technology for closed loop robotic sanding operations.",,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering,Robotics",,,,,,

However, their widespread adoption is impaired by concerns about data efficiency and the capability to generalize when applied to various tasks. This paper focuses on both these aspects with regard to a vision-based tactile sensor, which aims to reconstruct the distribution of the three-dimensional contact forces applied on its soft surface. Accurate models for the soft materials and the camera projection, derived via state-of-the-art techniques in the respective domains, are employed to generate a dataset in simulation. A strategy is proposed to train a tailored deep neural network entirely from the simulation data. The resulting learning architecture is directly transferable across multiple tactile sensors without further training and yields accurate predictions on real data, while showing promising generalization capabilities to unseen contact conditions.",GRASP,Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Automation & Control Systems,Computer Science,Engineering,Robotics",,,GRASP,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02640,

However, in DR there is a conflict between adaptability and training stability, and heavy DR tends to result in instability or even failure in training. To relieve this conflict, we propose a new algorithm named Domain Decomposition (DD) that decomposes the randomized domain according to environments and trains a separate RL policy for each part. This decomposition stabilizes the training of each RL policy, and as we prove theoretically, the adaptability of the overall policy can be preserved. Our simulation results verify that DD really improves stability in training while preserving ideal adaptability. Further, we complete a complex real-world vision-based patrolling task using DD, which demonstrates DD's practicality.

This creates a material map that localizes the various materials in the environment which has potential applications for search and rescue scenarios. A tapping mechanism and tapping audio signal processing based on machine learning techniques are exploited for a robot to identify the objects and materials.

The process is called X-ray crystallography (XRC). Traditionally, it is done by human experts with some conjecture about what structure the crystalline material is likely to be. However, the study of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction patterns is applicable in many domains, such as chemistry, physics, biology, etc. It is tedious to have manual crystallography of X-ray diffraction patterns to determine a crystal structure with a massive amount of dataset. With the advent of high computational resources, deep learning techniques have taken classification to its peak. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) maps an input image into a high dimensional space and produce a low-cost function for image classification. In this paper, we deploy a variation of the Convolution Neural Network to predict crystal structure from X-ray diffraction patterns. We compare our approach with a wide range of conventional as well as modern Machine Learning based classification techniques for the structure prediction of a crystal. We report a cross-validation accuracy of 95.6% and Micro F1-score of 0.949 with our model for the proposed task which is significantly better than the other reported baseline methods.","X-ray Diffraction Pattern,Crystal Structure Classification,Deep Learning,Convolutional Neural Network,Image Processing",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,"BRAGG-DIFFRACTION,CLASSIFIER",2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERWORLDS (CW 2020),,

In this paper, we present a large scale study of using virtual reality technology for safety training. Beyond the training, a technology framework is proposed to assess the fitness of construction workers (e.g. suitability of people with underlining health conditions to work under particular construction environments). The new virtual construction system consists of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) of electroencephalography (EEG) neural network to capture EEG signals of users during the virtual simulation training continuously to achieve user profiling. For real-time assessment of the accident susceptibility of a worker under various construction environments, a deep learning neural network is trained to process the EEG crops and a clipping training algorithm that classifies small segments of the EEG dataset is used to improve the computational performance of the system. Physiology data of the person during the training, i.e. blood pressure and heart rate, is also recorded. Based on the EEG data and the physiology data, a statistic model is used in the safety assessment framework to set up the risk standard. The study has tested 117 workers who were employed by the construction sites in Shanghai. People who were tested in the risk group were further underwent medical examinations for risk related medical conditions that deemed unsuitable for working in construction sites. Results show six of the nine workers identified by the VR system have been medically confirmed unsiutiable, thus, over 80% accuracy of our virtual reality training and assessment system. Our proposed system can be used as a tool for understanding risk conditions of workers and safety training.","Virtual Reality,Training and Evaluation,BCI,EEG Signal Processing,Construction Safety",Proceedings Paper,"IEEE, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","Computer Science,Engineering",,,SYSTEM,2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERWORLDS (CW 2020),,
