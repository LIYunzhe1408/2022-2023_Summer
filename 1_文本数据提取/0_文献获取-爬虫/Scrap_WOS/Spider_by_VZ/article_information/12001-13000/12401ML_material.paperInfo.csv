1,How Laboratory Experiments Can Be Exploited for Monitoring Stress in the Wild: A Bridge Between Laboratory and Daily Life,20,3,,"Can Yekta Said,Gokay Dilara,Kilic Dilruba Reyyan,Ekiz Deniz,Chalabianloo Niaz,Ersoy Cem","Can YS,Gokay D,Kilic DR,Ekiz D,Chalabianloo N,Ersoy C",Can YS,10.3390/s20030838,Bogazici University,"Chronic stress leads to poor well-being, and it has effects on life quality and health. Society may have significant benefits from an automatic daily life stress detection system using unobtrusive wearable devices using physiological signals. However, the performance of these systems is not sufficiently accurate when they are used in unrestricted daily life compared to the systems tested in controlled real-life and laboratory conditions. To test our stress level detection system that preprocesses noisy physiological signals, extracts features, and applies machine learning classification techniques, we used a laboratory experiment and ecological momentary assessment based data collection with smartwatches in daily life. We investigated the effect of different labeling techniques and different training and test environments. In the laboratory environments, we had more controlled situations, and we could validate the perceived stress from self-reports. When machine learning models were trained in the laboratory instead of training them with the data coming from daily life, the accuracy of the system when tested in daily life improved significantly. The subjectivity effect coming from the self-reports in daily life could be eliminated. Our system obtained higher stress level detection accuracy results compared to most of the previous daily life studies.","smart band,stress recognition,physiological signal processing,machine learning",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,,"HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY,RECOGNITION,RESPONSES,EMOTION,SENSORS,SYSTEM",SENSORS,https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/sensors/sensors-20-00838/article_deploy/sensors-20-00838-v3.pdf,

Female dancers (n = 30) performed a series of bilateral and unilateral ballet jumps. Dancers wore six ActiGraph Link wearable sensors (100 Hz). Data were collected simultaneously from two AMTI force platforms and synchronised with the ActiGraph data. Due to sensor hardware malfunctions and synchronisation issues, a multistage approach to model development, using a reduced data set, was taken. Using data from the 14 dancers with complete multi-sensor synchronised data, the best single sensor was determined. Subsequently, the best single sensor model was refined and validated using all available data for that sensor (23 dancers). Root mean square error (RMSE) in body weight (BW) and correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess the GRF profile, and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess model peak GRF accuracy. The model based on sacrum data was the most accurate single sensor model (unilateral landings: RMSE = 0.24 BW, r = 0.95; bilateral landings: RMSE = 0.21 BW, r = 0.98) with the refined model still showing good accuracy (unilateral: RMSE = 0.42 BW, r = 0.80; bilateral: RMSE = 0.39 BW, r = 0.92). Machine-learning models applied to wearable sensor data can provide a field-based system for GRF estimation during ballet jumps.","machine learning,inertial sensor,ballet,ground reaction force",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,"LANDING,BIOMECHANICS,DANCERS,MICROSENSORS,KINEMATICS,FATIGUE,EVENTS",SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7038404,

To process the multiple mode spectra that are dependent on multiple parameters, we adopt the machine learning algorithm instead of massive asymptotic solutions of resonators. Employing the proposed multi-mode sensing approach, a two-parameter SIMRR sensor is designed. Assuming that two gases have different wavelength dependence of refractive indices, the feasibility and effectiveness of the two-parameter sensing strategy are verified numerically. Moreover, the dependence of parameter estimation accuracy on the laser intensity noises is also investigated.

Multiple physiological signals such as respiration (RSP) and heart rate variability (HRV) were acquired in an experiment from 53 participants when six basic emotion states were induced. Two RSP parameters were acquired from a chest-band respiration sensor, and five HRV parameters were acquired from a finger-clip blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor. A newly designed deep-learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was adopted for detecting the identification accuracy of individual emotions. Additionally, the signal combination of the acquired parameters was proposed to obtain high classification accuracy. Furthermore, a dominant factor influencing the accuracy was found by comparing the relativeness of the parameters, providing a basis for supporting the results of emotion classification.

These approaches range from common classification architectures based on a set of carefully designed handcrafted features, to deep neural networks characterised by an autonomous extraction of relevant facial descriptors and simultaneous optimisation of a classification architecture. In the current work, an end-to-end approach based on attention networks for the analysis and recognition of pain-related facial expressions is proposed. The method combines both spatial and temporal aspects of facial expressions through a weighted aggregation of attention-based neural networks' outputs, based on sequences of Motion History Images (MHIs) and Optical Flow Images (OFIs). Each input stream is fed into a specific attention network consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled to a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). An attention mechanism generates a single weighted representation of each input stream (MHI sequence and OFI sequence), which is subsequently used to perform specific classification tasks. Simultaneously, a weighted aggregation of the classification scores specific to each input stream is performed to generate a final classification output. The assessment conducted on both the BioVid Heat Pain Database (Part A) and SenseEmotion Database points at the relevance of the proposed approach, as its classification performance is on par with state-of-the-art classification approaches proposed in the literature.","convolutional neural networks,long short-term memory recurrent neural networks,information fusion,pain recognition",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.735,,SENSORS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7038688,

Our goal was to develop software to automate the conversion of image annotations in a commercial PACS to the Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) standardized format and demonstrate the utility of this conversion for automated matching of lesion measurements across time points for cancer lesion tracking. We created a software module in Java to parse the DICOM presentation state (DICOM-PS) objects (that contain the image annotations) for imaging studies exported from a commercial PACS (GE Centricity v3.x). Our software identifies line annotations encoded within the DICOM-PS objects and exports the annotations in the AIM format. A separate Python script processes the AIM annotation files to match line measurements (on lesions) across time points by tracking the 3D coordinates of annotated lesions. To validate the interoperability of our approach, we exported annotations from Centricity PACS into ePAD () (Rubin et al., Transl Oncol 7(1):23-35, 2014), a freely available AIM-compliant workstation, and the lesion measurement annotations were correctly linked by ePAD across sequential imaging studies. As quantitative imaging becomes more prevalent in radiology, interoperability of image annotations gains increasing importance. Our work demonstrates that image annotations in a vendor system lacking standard semantics can be automatically converted to a standardized metadata format such as AIM, enabling interoperability and potentially facilitating large-scale analysis of image annotations and the generation of high-quality labels for deep learning initiatives. This effort could be extended for use with other vendors' PACS.","Lesion tracking,Annotation and Image Markup (AIM),Data mining,Supervised training,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,TRACKING,JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064644,

Because serious complications can arise from malpositioned catheters, X-ray images are used to assess the position of a catheter immediately after placement. Previous computer vision approaches to detect catheters on X-ray images were either rule-based or only capable of processing a limited number or type of catheters projecting over the chest. With the resurgence of deep learning, supervised training approaches are beginning to show promising results. However, dense annotation maps are required, and the work of a human annotator is difficult to scale. In this work, we propose an automatic approach for detection of catheters and tubes on pediatric X-ray images. We propose a simple way of synthesizing catheters on X-ray images to generate a training dataset by exploiting the fact that catheters are essentially tubular structures with various cross sectional profiles. Further, we develop a UNet-style segmentation network with a recurrent module that can process inputs at multiple scales and iteratively refine the detection result. By training on adult chest X-rays, the proposed network exhibits promising detection results on pediatric chest/abdomen X-rays in terms of both precision and recall, with F-beta = 0.8. The approach described in this work may contribute to the development of clinical systems to detect and assess the placement of catheters on X-ray images.

Vertebrae segmentation is very important but difficult task in medical imaging due to low-contrast imaging and noise. It becomes more challenging when dealing with fractured (osteoporotic) cases. This work is dedicated to address the challenging problem of vertebra segmentation. In the past, various segmentation techniques of vertebrae have been proposed. Recently, deep learning techniques have been introduced in biomedical image processing for segmentation and characterization of several abnormalities. These techniques are becoming popular for segmentation purposes due to their robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel combination of traditional region-based level set with deep learning framework in order to predict shape of vertebral bones accurately; thus, it would be able to handle the fractured cases efficiently. We termed this novel Framework as ""FU-Net"" which is a powerful and practical framework to handle fractured vertebrae segmentation efficiently.

Three hundred seven patients (199 without any fractures of the spine, and 108 patients with at least one fracture of the L1, L2, L3, or L4 vertebral bodies) who had DEXA studies were evaluated. Ancillary data from DEXA output was analyzed. The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Support vector machines (SVMs) with 10-fold cross-validation and different kernels were used to identify the best kernel based on the greatest area under the curve (AUC) and the best training vectors in the training dataset. The SVM with the best kernel was then applied to the test dataset to assess the accuracy of the SVM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the SVMs using different kernels in the test dataset were compared using DeLong's test. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel had the greatest AUC in the training dataset (AUC = 0.9258). The AUC of the SVM classifier with the linear kernel in the test dataset was 0.8963. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel had an overall average accuracy of 91.8% in the test dataset. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive of the SVM classifier with the linear kernel to detect lumbar spine fractures were 81.8%, 97.4%, 94.7%, and 90.5%, respectively.

However, accurate lobe segmentation is difficult as 80% of patients have incomplete and/or fake fissures. Furthermore, lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can increase the difficulty of differentiating the lobar fissures. Lobar fissures have similar intensities to those of the vessels and airway wall, which could lead to segmentation error in automated segmentation. In this study, a fully automated lung lobe segmentation method with 3D U-Net was developed and validated with internal and external datasets. The volumetric chest CT scans of 196 normal and mild-to-moderate COPD patients from three centers were obtained. Each scan was segmented using a conventional image processing method and manually corrected by an expert thoracic radiologist to create gold standards. The lobe regions in the CT images were then segmented using a 3D U-Net architecture with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using separate training, validation, and test datasets. In addition, 40 independent external CT images were used to evaluate the model. The segmentation results for both the conventional and deep learning methods were compared quantitatively to the gold standards using four accuracy metrics including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff surface distance (HSD). In internal validation, the segmentation method achieved high accuracy for the DSC, JSC, MSD, and HSD (0.97 +/- 0.02, 0.94 +/- 0.03, 0.69 +/- 0.36, and 17.12 +/- 11.07, respectively).

Furthermore, pelvic hematomas occupy a small proportion of the entire volume of a chest, abdomen, and pelvis (C/A/P) trauma CT. The challenges are many, and no automated methods for segmentation and volumetric analysis have been described to date. Traditional approaches using fully convolutional networks result in coarse segmentations and class imbalance with suboptimal convergence. In this study, we implement a modified coarse-to-fine deep learning approach-the Recurrent Saliency Transformation Network (RSTN) for pelvic hematoma volume segmentation. RSTN previously yielded excellent results in pancreas segmentation, where low contrast with adjacent structures, small target volume, variable location, and fine contours are also problematic. We have curated a unique single-institution corpus of 253 C/A/P admission trauma CT studies in patients with bleeding pelvic fractures with manually labeled pelvic hematomas. We hypothesized that RSTN would result in sufficiently high Dice similarity coefficients to facilitate accurate and objective volumetric measurements for outcome prediction (arterial injury requiring angioembolization). Cases were separated into five combinations of training and test sets in an 80/20 split and fivefold cross-validation was performed. Dice scores in the test set were 0.71 (SD +/- 0.10) using RSTN, compared to 0.49 (SD +/- 0.16) using a baseline Deep Learning Tool Kit (DLTK) reference 3D U-Net architecture. Mean inference segmentation time for RSTN was 0.90 min (+/- 0.26). Pearson correlation between predicted and manual labels was 0.95 with p < 0.0001. Measurement bias was within 10 mL. AUC of hematoma volumes for predicting need for angioembolization was 0.81 (predicted) versus 0.80 (manual). Qualitatively, predicted labels closely followed hematoma contours and avoided muscle and displaced viscera. Further work will involve validation using a federated dataset and incorporation into a predictive model using multiple segmented features.","Pelvic fractures,Pelvic ring disruptions,Computed tomography (CT),Hematoma volume,Segmentation,Deep learning,Artificial intelligence (AI),Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD),Convolutional neural network (CNN),Fully convolutional network (FCN),Recurrent saliency transformation network (RSTN)",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.977,"HEMORRHAGE,PREDICTORS,FRACTURES,MORTALITY,NETWORK,VOLUME",JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064706,

Because of the creep inconsistency of large scale piezoresistive material, a creep tracking compensation method based on K-means clustering and fuzzy pattern recognition was proposed to improve the detection accuracy. With the compensated data, the inconsistency and nonlinearity of the sensor was calibrated. The calibration process was divided into two parts. The hierarchical clustering algorithm was utilized firstly to classify and fuse piezoresistive property of different regions over the whole sensor. Then, combining the position information, the force detection model was constructed by Back-Propagation (BP) neural network. At last, a novel flexible tactile sensor for detecting contact position and force was designed as an example and tested after being calibrated.

Spinal cord segmentation plays a significant part in analyzing the neurological disease. In this paper here, an approach on the basis of the automatic spinal cord segmentation is proposed. This automatic technique presented performs the segmentation of the spinal cord with the help of MRI datasets. This new segmentation follows the interactive Random-Walk solvers (RW) along with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm in order to be an entirely automatic flow pipeline. The initialization of the automatic segmentation pipeline is then done with a reliable voxel-wise classification employing features similar to Haar and supervised machine learning technique i.e. Probabilistic Boosting Tree (PBT) along with Support Vector Machine (SVM) so named as PBTSVM. Thereafter, the extraction of the refinement topology of the spinal cord is then done from the temporary segmentation and it is fine-tuned for the further next random-walk solver with ABC. The refined topology results in the spinal cord's boundary conditions from the MRI that permits the following random-walk solver with ABC for improving the segmentation result. The experimental outcomes of the novel segmentation approach depending on the MRI images indicate that the system proposed PBT-SVM algorithm provides better accuracy when compared to the other existing Active Contour Model, Multi-Resolution Propagation algorithms. Experimentation results of the proposed PBT-SVM algorithm produces higher accuracy results of 93% which is 2.5 and 3.233% higher when compared to Active Contour Model and Multi-Resolution Propagation methods respectively.","Central nervous system (CNS),Spinal cord segmentation,Magnetic resonance images (MRI),Random-walk solvers (RW),Artificial bee Colony (ABC),Probabilistic boosting tree (PBT),Support vector machine (SVM)",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","Computer Science,Engineering",,2.517,CT,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,,

However, parties interested in monitoring CWD abundance lack accurate methods to measure CWD accurately and extensively. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for mapping CWD volume (m(3)) across a 4300-hectare study area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada using optical imagery and an infra-canopy vegetation-index layer derived from multispectral aerial LiDAR. Our models predicted CWD volume with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.62 compared to field data, and a root-mean square error (RMSE) of 0.224 m(3)/100 m(2). Models using multispectral LiDAR data in addition to image-analysis data performed with up to 12% lower RMSE than models using exclusively image-analysis layers. Site managers and researchers requiring reliable and comprehensive maps of CWD volume may benefit from the presented workflow, which aims to streamline the process of CWD measurement.

However, its stocks have dramatically declined due, inter alia, to excessive logging, insufficient natural regeneration and a slow recovery rate. Thus, there is a need to promote enrichment planting and develop effective technique to support its rehabilitation and improve timber production through implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genomic Selection (GS). To assist such efforts, plant materials were collected from a half-sib progeny population in Sari Bumi Kusuma forest concession, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using 5900 markers in sequences obtained from 356 individuals, we detected high linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending up to >145 kb, suggesting that associations between phenotypic traits and markers in LD can be more easily and feasibly detected with GWAS than with analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the detection power of GWAS seems low, since few single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any focal traits were detected with a stringent false discovery rate, indicating that the species' phenotypic traits are mostly under polygenic quantitative control. Furthermore, Machine Learning provided higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods. We also found that stem diameter, branch diameter ratio and wood density were more predictable than height, clear bole, branch angle and wood stiffness traits. Our study suggests that GS has potential for improving the productivity and quality of S. platyclados, and our genomic heritability estimates may improve the selection of traits to target in future breeding of this species.","Shorea platyclados,GWAS,GS,growth,wood quality traits,genomic heritability",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Forestry,,2.804,"LINKAGE,DISEQUILIBRIUM,DEMOGRAPHIC,HISTORY,STATISTICAL-METHODS,TRAITS,PREDICTION,POPULATION,REGRESSION,MODELS,PLANT,DIPTEROCARPACEAE",FORESTS,https://tsukuba.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=55927&item_no=1&attribute_id=17&file_no=1,

This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with elastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural and hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements and experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor of 10-20 in the riser design, which increases development costs and adds extra constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive parameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is to demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These parameters will be grouped by using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal hydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. Last but not least, classification algorithms will be applied to determine the correct hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases. An iteration of the previous steps may be needed if the prediction accuracy of the new case is not satisfactory. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental data.","vortex-induced vibrations,model test,hydrodynamics,machine learning,data clustering,data classification",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Engineering,Oceanography",,2.455,"VORTEX-INDUCED,VIBRATIONS,FLEXIBLE,CYLINDER",JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/125575/1/jmse-08-00127.pdf,

First, the method of multi-object correlation is used to determine the region of interest that the face is sensitive to physical stress. Furthermore, the stress signal is extracted through the thermal signal and the method based on blind source separation is adopted to convert the thermal signal into an independent component that is sensitive to stress. Second, the independent component signal is amplified to extract the peak frequency. Lastly, the baseline and physical stress states are classified and identified using the deep learning algorithm model. The algorithm model was verified with respect to the physical stress ground truth to classify the baseline and physical stress status.

However, the dynamic regulation of two motion states, which usually happens in real life, is rarely studied. Besides, popular within-subject methods also require an extensive and time-consuming learning stage when testing on a new subject. This paper proposed a method to discriminate dynamic gait- adjustment intention with strong adaptability for different subjects. Methods: Cerebral hemoglobin signals obtained from 30 subjects were studied to decode gait-adjustment intention. Cerebral hemoglobin information was recorded by using fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) technology. Mathematical morphology filtering was applied to remove zero drift and EWM (Entropy Weight Method) was used to calculate the average hemoglobin values over Regions of Interest (ROIs). The gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) was utilized to detect the onset of self-regulated intention. A 2-layer-GA-SVM (Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine) model based on stacking algorithm was further proposed to identify the four types of self-regulated intention (speed increase, speed reduction, step increase, and step reduction). Results: It was found that GBDT had a good performance to detect the onset intention with an average AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.894. The 2-layer-GA-SVM model boosted the average ACC (accuracy) of four types of intention from 70.6% to 84.4% (p =0.005) from the single GA-SVM model. Furthermore, the proposed method passed pseudo-online test with the average results as following: AUC = 0.883, TPR (True Positive Rate) = 97.5%, FPR (False Positive Rate) = 0.11%, and LAY (Detection Latency) = -0.52 +/- 2.57 seconds for the recognition of gait-adjustment intention; ACC = 80% for the recognition of adjusted gait. Conclusion: The results indicate that it is feasible to decode dynamic gait-adjustment intentions from a motion state for different subjects based on fNIRS technology. It has a potential to realize the practical application of fNIRS-based brain-computer interface technology in controlling walking-assistive devices.","Brain-computer interface,functional near infrared spectroscopy,self-regulated intention,ensemble learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Rehabilitation",,4.735,"BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE,PREFRONTAL,CORTEX,CORTICAL,CONTROL,GAIT,CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEM,SELECTION,FMRI",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,,

Such datasets are typically high-dimensional and exhibit strong temporal correlations. Better understanding of the underlying processes requires mapping such data to a low-dimensional manifold where the dynamics of the latent processes are evident. While nonlinear spectral dimensionality reduction methods, e.g., Isomap, and their scalable variants, are conceptually fit candidates for obtaining such a mapping, the presence of the strong temporal correlation in the data can significantly impact these methods. In this paper, we first show why such methods fail when dealing with dynamic process data. A novel method, Entropy-Isomap, is proposed to handle this shortcoming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the context of understanding the fabrication process of organic materials. The resulting low-dimensional representation correctly characterizes the process control variables and allows for informative visualization of the material morphology evolution.","manifold learning,time series,dynamic processes",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Computer Science,,,"REDUCTION,TRANSISTORS,CELLS",ALGORITHMS,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/13/2/30/pdf,

This study aims to propose a novel approach for recognizing gait phases and events, based on deep-learning analysis of only sagittal knee-joint angle measured by a single electrogoniometer per leg. Promising classification/prediction performances have been previously achieved by surface-EMG studies; thus, a further aim is to test if adding electrogoniometer data could improve classification performances of state-of-the-art methods. Gait data are measured in about 10,000 strides from 23 healthy adults, during ground walking. A multi-layer perceptron model is implemented, composed of three hidden layers and a one-dimensional output. Classification/prediction accuracy is tested vs. ground truth represented by foot-floor-contact signals, through samples acquired from subjects not seen during training phase. Average classification-accuracy of 90.6 +/- 2.9% and mean absolute value (MAE) of 29.4 +/- 13.7 and 99.5 +/- 28.9 ms in assessing heel-strike and toe-off timing are achieved in unseen subjects. Improvement of classification-accuracy (four points) and reduction of MAE (at least 35%) are achieved when knee-angle data are used to enhance sEMG-data prediction. Comparison of the two approaches shows as the reduction of set-up complexity implies a worsening of mainly toe-off prediction. Thus, the present electrogoniometer approach is particularly suitable for the classification tasks where only heel-strike event is involved, such as stride recognition, stride-time computation, and identification of toe walking.","knee angle,deep learning,neural networks,gait-phase classification,electrogoniometer,EMG sensors,walking,gait-event detection",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Computer Science,Engineering,Physics",,2.408,"SYSTEM,CLASSIFICATION,WALKING,EVENTS",ELECTRONICS,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/2/355/pdf,

The early detection of the disease plays an extremely important role in preventing vision loss which is the consequence of diabetes mellitus remaining untreated among patients for a prolonged time period. Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been implemented on diabetic retinopathy dataset for classification and prediction of the disease but majority of them have neglected the aspect of data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction, leading to biased results.

In order to drop its rate, effective and timely diagnosis of the disease is very essential. Numerous automated decision support systems have been developed for this purpose. In the present research, a predictive model consisting of two-level optimization is introduced, to save lives and cost via effective diagnosis of the disease. Level-1 optimization of the model first identifies parallelly an optimal proportion (P-opt) for training and test sets for each dataset on parallel machine. Next, the best training set (T-best) for P-opt is again searched parallelly. On the other hand, level-2 optimization refines the rule set (R) generated by the Perfect Rule Induction by Sequential Method (PRISM) learner on T-best employing parallel genetic algorithm. The experimental results obtained by the model over the heart disease datasets (collected from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml) are compared and analysed with its base learner and four state-of-the-art learners, namely C4.5 (decision tree-based classifier), Naive Bayes, neural network and support vector machine. The empirical outcomes (based on the top performance metrics-prediction accuracy, precision, recall, area under curve values, true positive and false positive rates) positively demonstrate that the new model is proficient in undertaking heart disease treatment. Importantly, the prediction accuracy of the presented hybrid model exceeds around 6% than that of the sequential GA-based hybrid model over almost all the chosen datasets. After all, the proposed system may work as an e-doctor to predict heart attack and assist clinicians to take precautionary steps.","Heart disease,Hybrid model,Parallel GA,Effective diagnosis,e-doctor",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Computer Science,,,"DIAGNOSIS,CLASSIFICATION,ALGORITHM,NETWORKS",SOFT COMPUTING,,

Currently, the proposed methods for automatic material classification are mainly based on 2D images by using the visual features of building materials. A terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) with a built-in camera can generate a set of coloured laser scan data that contain the surface geometries of building materials. The laser scan data include not only the visual features of building materials but also other attributes such as material reflectance and surface roughness. With more attributes provided, laser scan data have the potential to improve the accuracy of building material classification. Therefore, this research aims to develop a TLS data-based classification method for common building materials using machine learning techniques. The developed technique uses material reflectance, HSV colour values, and surface roughness as the features for material classification. A database containing the laser scan data of ten common building materials was created and used for model training and validation with machine learning techniques.

More generic a prior information could be acquired via deep learning and utilized for image reconstruction. In this study, we developed a volumetric hierarchical deep residual convolutional neural network, referred to as T-Net, to provide a data-driven end-to-end mapping from sparsely sampled MR images to fully sampled MR images, where cartilage MR images were acquired using an Ultra-short TE sequence and retrospectively undersampled using pseudo-random Cartesian and radial acquisition schemes. The network had a hierarchical architecture that promoted the sparsity of feature maps and increased the receptive field, which were valuable for signal synthesis and artifact suppression. Relatively dense local connections and global shortcuts were established to facilitate residual learning and compensate for details lost in hierarchical processing. Additionally, volumetric processing was adopted to fully exploit spatial continuity in three-dimensional space. Data consistency was further enforced. The network was trained with 336 three-dimensional images (each consisting of 32 slices) and tested by 24 images. The incorporation of a priori information acquired via deep learning facilitated high acceleration factors (as high as 8) while maintaining high image fidelity (quantitatively evaluated using the structural similarity index measurement).

This pouch type battery is characterized by high power rating and high energy density. The batteries used in the experiments were manufactured by varying the design ratios of nickel, cobalt, and manganese (5:2:3 and 6:2:2) in the NCM cathode materials. An accelerated deterioration test was carried out by applying a current of 80 A at 4C-rate (C-rate is the charge-discharge rate of a battery relative to its nominal capacity). The characteristics of the differential capacity were analyzed under varying deterioration conditions. The impedance characteristics for a given state of charge (SOC) and deterioration level were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. In addition, the battery-equivalent circuit model was designed to estimate the model parameters of the alternating current (AC) impedance. The model parameters of the direct current (DC) impedance were estimated and compared through the direct current internal resistance (DCIR) test. Machine learning was performed by using the data extracted from the accelerated deterioration test as learning data, and by applying it to the multiple linear regression and the recurrent neural network methods.

However, the diagnosis accuracy results of such methods are still insignificant and need improvement in order to manifest robust solution. The study aim is to develop and propose a new automatic classification of NPC tumor using machine learning techniques and feature-based decision-level fusion scheme from endoscopic images.

In detail, the hybrid method is based on using both image processing and deep learning for improved results. In medical image processing, reliable diabetic retinopathy detection from digital fundus images is known as an open problem and needs alternative solutions to be developed. In this context, manual interpretation of retinal fundus images requires the magnitude of work, expertise, and over-processing time. So, doctors need support from imaging and computer vision systems and the next step is widely associated with use of intelligent diagnosis systems. The solution method proposed in this study includes employment of image processing with histogram equalization, and the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization techniques. Next, the diagnosis is performed by the classification of a convolutional neural network. The method was validated using 400 retinal fundus images within the MESSIDOR database, and average values for different performance evaluation parameters were obtained as accuracy 97%, sensitivity (recall) 94%, specificity 98%, precision 94%, FScore 94%, and GMean 95%. In addition to those results, a general comparison of with some previously carried out studies has also shown that the introduced method is efficient and successful enough at diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images.

The limitations related to traditional methods of BE detection and management encourage the creation of computer-aided tools to assist in this problem. In this work, we introduce the unsupervised Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier for learning visual dictionaries in the context of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and automatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis. The proposed approach was validated in two datasets (MICCAI 2015 and Augsburg) using three different feature extractors (SIFT, SURF, and the not yet applied to the BE context A-KAZE), as well as five supervised classifiers, including two variants of the OPF, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function and Linear kernels, and a Bayesian classifier. Concerning MICCAI 2015 dataset, the best results were obtained using unsupervised OPF for dictionary generation using supervised OPF for classification purposes and using SURF feature extractor with accuracy nearly to 78% for distinguishing BE patients from adenocarcinoma ones. Regarding the Augsburg dataset, the most accurate results were also obtained using both OPF classifiers but with A-KAZE as the feature extractor with accuracy close to 73%. The combination of feature extraction and bag-of-visual-words techniques showed results that outperformed others obtained recently in the literature, as well as we highlight new advances in the related research area. Reinforcing the significance of this work, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first one that aimed at addressing computer-aided BE identification using bag-of-visual-words and OPF classifiers, being the application of unsupervised technique in the BE feature calculation the major contribution of this work.

Available treatments target its symptoms, aiming to improve the quality of life. However, automatic diagnosis at early stages is still a challenging medicine-related task to date, since a patient may have an identical behavior to that of a healthy individual at the very early stage of the disease. Parkinson's disease detection through handwriting data is a significant classification problem for identification of PD at the infancy stage. In this paper, a PD identification is realized with help of handwriting images that help as one of the earliest indicators for PD. For this purpose, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network classifier with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to improve the identification. Two approaches like freeze and fine-tuning of transfer learning are investigated using ImageNet and MNIST dataset as source task independently. A trained network achieved 98.28% accuracy using fine-tuning-based approach using ImageNet and PaHaW dataset.

Objective assessment of breathing patterns of an individual can provide useful insight into the respiratory function unearthing severity of Hypopnea syndrome. This paper explores a novel approach to detect incognito Hypopnea syndrome as well as provide a contactless alternative to traditional medical tests. The proposed method is based on S-Band sensing technique (including a spectrum analyzer, vector network analyzer, antennas, software-defined radio, RF generator, etc.), peak detection algorithm and Sine function fitting for the observation of breathing patterns and characterization of normal or disruptive breathing patterns for Hypopnea syndrome detection. The proposed system observes the human subject and changes in the channel frequency response caused by Hypopnea syndrome utilizing a wireless link between two monopole antennas, placed 3 m apart. Commercial respiratory sensors were used to verify the experimental results. By comparing the results, it is found that for both cases, the pause time is more than 10 s with 14 peaks.

The quality of admixtures play a crucial role in altering fresh concrete properties. To streamline such quality control process for regular inspections, two key procedures are necessary: (1) collection and maintenance of the baseline approved admixtures quality, and (2) usage of sound analysis tools and procedures for quality verification of newly supplied materials. However, relying on manual comparison by the naked eye makes the identification process very tedious and inaccurate due to similar patterns of admixture infrared spectrophotometry (IR) signatures. Therefore, an efficient and standardized system is necessary for an accurate quality control process. In this study, advanced quality control models are investigated and proposed by utilizing the pattern-recognition methodology using artificial neural networks (ANNs) by utilizing data-driven and self-adaptive functions and other advanced machine-learning techniques for the pattern classification function. The feasibility of the proposed models were evaluated for the automatic quality control process. To identify a mixture's chemical and physical properties, energy absorption is measured at each wave number through the amount of transmitted infrared light. Developed pattern-recognition ANNs and other machine-learning models have shown their efficiency in learning and identifying the admixtures' IR signature spectra. Hence, the proposed advanced quality control models can be a very useful tool to determine the admixtures' quality accurately and quickly and eventually to guarantee their intended performance in altering the concrete's properties.

We aim to answer consumer health questions with information from reliable sources.
Materials and Methods: We combine knowledge-based, traditional machine and deep learning approaches to understand consumers' questions and select the best answers from consumer-oriented sources. We evaluate the end-to-end system and its components on simple questions generated in a pilot development of MedlinePlus Alexa skill, as well as the short and long real-life questions submitted to the National Library of Medicine by consumers.
Results: Our system achieves 78.7% mean average precision and 87.9% mean reciprocal rank on simple Alexa questions, and 44.5% mean average precision and 51.6% mean reciprocal rank on real-life questions submitted by National Library of Medicine consumers.
Discussion: The ensemble of deep learning, domain knowledge, and traditional approaches recognizes question type and focus well in the simple questions, but it leaves room for improvement on the real-life consumers' questions. Information retrieval approaches alone are sufficient for finding answers to simple Alexa questions.

Materials and Methods: We identified studies involving social media, PMs, and misuse or abuse (inclusion criteria) from Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We categorized studies based on multiple characteristics including but not limited to data size; social media source(s); medications studied; and primary objectives, methods, and findings.
Results: A total of 39 studies met our inclusion criteria, with 31 (similar to 79.5%) published since 2015.

Methods A ray-casting US simulation approach is used to generate intermediate synthetic images from abdominal CT scans. Then, an unpaired set of these synthetic and real US images is used to train CycleGANs with two alternative architectures for the generator, a U-Net and a ResNet. These networks are finally used to translate ray-casting based simulations into more realistic synthetic US images. Results Our approachwas evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Auser study performed by 21 experts inUSimaging shows that both networks significantly improve realism with respect to the original ray-casting algorithm ( p 0.0001), with the ResNet model performing better than the U-Net ( p 0.0001). Conclusion Applying CycleGANs allows to obtain better synthetic US images of the abdomen. These results can contribute to reduce the gap between artificially generated and real US scans, which might positively impact in applications such as semi-supervised training of machine learning algorithms and low-cost training of medical doctors and radiologists in US image interpretation.","Ultrasound,Image simulation,Deep learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"MEDICAL,ULTRASOUND",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Previous methods that derived modality-invariant representations focused on either global statistical grayscale relations or local structural similarity, both of which are prone to local optima. In contrast to most learning-based methods that rely on strong supervision of aligned multimodal image pairs, we aim to overcome this limitation for further practical use cases. Methods We propose a new concept that exploits anatomical shape information and requires only segmentation labels for both modalities individually. First, a shape-constrained encoder-decoder segmentation network without skip connections is jointly trained on labeled CT and MRI inputs. Second, an iterative energy-based minimization scheme is introduced that relies on the capability of the network to generate intermediate nonlinear shape representations. This further eases the multimodal alignment in the case of large deformations. Results Our novel approach robustly and accurately aligns 3D scans from the multimodal whole-heart segmentation dataset, outperforming classical unsupervised frameworks. Since both parts of our method rely on (stochastic) gradient optimization, it can be easily integrated in deep learning frameworks and executed on GPUs. Conclusions We present an integrated approach for weakly supervised multimodal image registration. Achieving promising results due to the exploration of intermediate shape features as registration guidance encourages further research in this direction.","Multimodal fusion,Guided image registration,Encoder-decoder network,Nonlinear shape interpolation",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Such a process can be very time-consuming, and the accuracy is affected by many factors, such as experience of radiologists and available diagnosis time. To address this problem, we proposed to develop a deep learning-based system to automatically classify benign and malignant lung nodules. Methods The proposed method automatically determines benignity or malignancy given the 3D CT image patch of a lung nodule to assist diagnosis process. Motivated by the fact that real structure among data is often embedded on a low-dimensional manifold, we developed a novel manifold regularized classification deep neural network (MRC-DNN) to perform classification directly based on the manifold representation of lung nodule images. The concise manifold representation revealing important data structure is expected to benefit the classification, while the manifold regularization enforces strong, but natural constraints on network training, preventing over-fitting. Results The proposed method achieves accurate manifold learning with reconstruction error of ~ 30 HU on real lung nodule CT image data. In addition, the classification accuracy on testing data is 0.90 with sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.95, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Conclusion The proposed MRC-DNN facilitates an accurate manifold learning approach for lung nodule classification based on 3D CT images. More importantly, MRC-DNN suggests a new and effective idea of enforcing regularization for network training, possessing the potential impact to a board range of applications.","Diagnosis,Lung nodule classification,Deep learning,Regularization,Manifold learning",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

In the case of multispecimen study to locate cancer regions, such as in thyroidectomy and prostatectomy, a significant labor-intensive processing is required at a high cost. Pathology diagnosis is usually done by a pathologist observing tissue-stained glass slide under a microscope. Method
Multispectral photoacoustic (MPA) specimen imaging has proven successful in differentiating photoacoustic (PA) signal characteristics between a histopathology-defined cancer region and normal tissue. This is mainly due to its ability to efficiently map oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin contents from MPA images and key features for cancer detection. A fully automated deep learning algorithm is purposed, which learns to detect the presence of malignant tissue in freshly excised ex vivo human thyroid and prostate tissue specimens using the three-dimensional MPA dataset. The proposed automated deep learning model consisted of the convolutional neural network architecture, which extracts spatially colocated features, and a softmax function, which detects thyroid and prostate cancer tissue at once. This is one of the first deep learning models, to the best of our knowledge, to detect the presence of cancer in excised thyroid and prostate tissue of humans at once based on PA imaging. Result The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a metric to evaluate the predictive performance of the classifier. The proposed model detected the cancer tissue with the AUC of 0.96, which is very promising. Conclusion This model is an improvement over the previous work using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This model may have immediate application in cancer screening of the numerous sliced specimens that result from thyroidectomy and prostatectomy. Since the instrument that was used to capture the ex vivo PA images is now being developed for in vivo use, this model may also prove to be a starting point for in vivo PA image analysis for cancer diagnosis.","Cancer tissue detection,Classification,Deep learning,Machine learning,3D CNN,Transfer learning,Computer-aided diagnosis,Prostate,Thyroid",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"NEURAL-NETWORKS,EX-VIVO",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

Methods This framework utilizes a new algorithm called universal distributional Q-learning (UDQL) to learn a stable steering policy and perform risk management by visualizing the learned Q-value distribution. To further improve the robustness, universal value function approximation is leveraged in the training process of UDQL to maximize generalization and connect to diagnosis by adapting fast re-planning and transfer learning. Results Computer simulation and phantom experimental results show our proposed framework can securely steer flexible needles with high insertion accuracy and robustness. The framework also improves robustness by providing distribution information to clinicians for diagnosis and decision making during surgery.

We evaluated different machine learning techniques with an emphasis on boosting algorithms and implemented them in an ArcGIS toolbox. Performance was tested on an exploration dataset from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) with respect to accuracy, performance, stability, and robustness. Boosting algorithms are ensemble methods used in supervised learning for regression and classification. They combine weak classifiers, i.e., classifiers that perform slightly better than random guessing to obtain robust classifiers. Each time a weak learner is added; the learning set is reweighted to give more importance to misclassified samples. Our test area, the IPB, is one of the oldest mining districts in the world and hosts giant volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposits. The spatial density of ore deposits, as well as the size and tonnage, makes the area unique, and due to the high data availability and number of known deposits, well-suited for testing machine learning algorithms. We combined several geophysical datasets, as well as layers derived from geological maps as predictors of the presence or absence of VMS deposits. Boosting algorithms such as BrownBoost and Adaboost were tested and compared to Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector machines (SVM) in several experiments. We found performance results relatively similar, especially to BrownBoost, which slightly outperformed LR and SVM with respective accuracies of 0.96 compared to 0.89 and 0.93. Data augmentation by perturbing deposit location led to a 7% improvement in results. Variations in the split ratio of training and test data led to a reduction in the accuracy of the prediction result with relative stability occurring at a critical point at around 26 training samples out of 130 total samples. When lower numbers of training data were introduced accuracy dropped significantly. In comparison with other machine learning methods, Adaboost is user-friendly due to relatively short training and prediction times, the low likelihood of overfitting and the reduced number of hyperparameters for optimization. Boosting algorithms gave high predictive accuracies, making them a potential data-driven alternative for regional scale and/or brownfields mineral exploration.","Boosting,Machine Learning,Prospectivity Mapping,Iberian Pyrite Belt,Exploration",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Geology,,4.269,"IBERIAN,PYRITE,BELT,EVIDENTIAL,BELIEF,FUNCTIONS,MASSIVE,SULFIDE,DEPOSITS,SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINE,GOLD-SILVER,DEPOSITS,WEIGHTS-OF-EVIDENCE,RANDOM,FOREST,FUZZY-LOGIC,GEOLOGICAL,CONSTRAINTS,NEURAL-NETWORKS",NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11053-019-09483-8.pdf,

For example, NQR is a promising technique for detecting plastic explosives and other forbidden substances as well as for authenticating pharmaceutical products. Spatially-resolved NQR measurements are of particular interest for enabling automated sample positioning, evaluation of sample heterogeneity, and chemometric authentication of objects. This paper proposes a rapid ""single-shot"" method for spatially-resolved NQR with the potential to benefit such applications. The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that certain NQR relaxation rates are field-dependent: the observed field dependence is used to convert relaxation time distributions measured in a static field gradient (estimated via Laplace inversion of time-domain data) into spatial distributions. The method was validated using Cl-35 and (37)Cl( )NQR of sodium chlorate and other compounds. Effective spatial resolution was also improved by using machine learning (ML) to classify the measured spatial distributions. In particular, experimental results demonstrate accurate ML-based classification of 3D-printed objects containing arbitrary binary distributions of sodium chlorate. Such distributions can thus be used as NQR-based ""embedded barcodes"" for authenticating high-value objects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: The multidetector computed tomography images of 227 ccRCCs were retrospectively analyzed. For each ccRCC, 14 conventional image features (CIFs) were extracted manually by two radiologists, and 556 texture features (TFs) were extracted by a free software application, MaZda (version 4.6). The high-dimensional dataset of these RSs was reduced using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Five minimum mean squared error models (minMSEMs) for predicting the ccRCC histopathological grades were constructed from the CIFs, the TFs of the corticomedullary phase images (CMP), and the TFs of the parenchyma phase (PP) images and their combinations, respectively abbreviated as CIF-minMSEM, CMP-minMSEM, PP-minMSEM, CIF+CMP-minMSEM, and CIF+PP-minMSEM. The RSs of each model were fed 30 times consecutively into an ANN for machine learning, and the predictive accuracy of each time ML was recorded for the statistical analysis.
Results: The five predictive models were constructed from 12, 19, and 10 features selected from the CIFs, the TFs of the CMP images, and that of PP images, respectively. On the basis of their accuracy across the whole cohort, the five models were ranked as follows: CIF+CMP-minMSEM (accuracy: 94.06% +/- 1.14%), CIF + PP-minMSEM (accuracy: 93.32% +/- 1.23%), CIF-minMSEM (accuracy: 92.26% +/- 1.65%), CMP-minMSEM (accuracy: 91.76% +/- 1.74%), and PP-minMSEM (accuracy: 90.89% +/- 1.47%).
Conclusion: Machine teaming based on ANN helped establish an optimal predictive model, and TFs contributed to the development of high accuracy predictive models.

Materials and Methods: Clinical data regarding consecutive patients who received intravenous thrombolysis across two tertiary hospitals over a 7-year period were extracted from existing databases. The noncontrast computed tomography brain scans for these patients were then retrieved with hospital picture archiving and communication systems. Using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN) several models were developed to predict either improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of >= 4 points at 24 hours (""NIHSS24""), or modified Rankin Scale 0-1 at 90 days (""mRS90"").

Methods This retrospective study included data for 61 patients who underwent head and neck radiotherapy. All planning CT images were obtained with a single-source DECT scanner (80 and 140 kVp) with rapid kVp switching. The DL-based method used a pair of virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) at 70 keV with and without contrast materials. VMIs without contrast materials were used as reference true noncontrast (TNC) images. Deformable image registration was used between the TNC and CE images. We used the data of 45 patients, chosen randomly, for training (7922 paired images), and data from the other 16 patients as test data. We generated the VNCDL images with a densely connected convolutional network. As the VNCDECT images, we used VMIs with the iodine signal suppressed, reconstructed from the CE images of the 16 test patients. The CT numbers of the tumor, common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, muscle, fat, bone marrow, cortical bone, and mandible of each VNC image were compared with those of the TNC image. The dose of the reference TNC plan was recalculated using the CE, VNCDL, and VNCDECT images. Difference maps of the dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were evaluated.
Results The mean prediction time for the VNCDL images was 3.4 s per patient, and the mean number of slices was 204. The absolute differences in CT numbers of the VNCDL images were significantly smaller than those of the VNCDECT images for the bone marrow (8.0 +/- 6.5 vs 175.1 +/- 40.9 HU; P < 0.001) and mandible (20.3 +/- 19.3 vs 106.2 +/- 80.5 HU; P = 0.002). The DL-based model provided the dose distribution most similar to that of the TNC plan. With the VNCDECT plans, dose errors >1.0% were observed in bone regions. The dose-volume histogram analysis showed that the VNCDL plans yielded the smallest errors for the primary target, although dose differences were <1.0% for all the approaches. For the maximum dose to the mandible, the mean +/- SD errors for the CE, VNCDL, and VNCDECT plans were -0.13% +/- 0.23% (range: -0.46% to 0.31%; P = 0.037), -0.01% +/- 0.22% (range: -0.40% to 0.36%; P = 1.0), and 0.53% +/- 0.47% (range: -0.21% to 1.41%; P < 0.001), respectively.
Conclusions In this study, we developed a method based on DL that can rapidly generate VNC images from CE images without a DECT scanner. Compared with the DECT approach, the DL-based method improved the prediction accuracy of CT numbers in bone regions. Consequently, there was greater agreement between the VNCDL and TNC plan dose distributions than with the CE and VNCDECT plans, achieved by suppressing the contrast material signals while retaining the CT numbers of bone structures.","deep learning,dose calculation,dual-energy CT,treatment planning,virtual noncontrast CT",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"MULTIMATERIAL,DECOMPOSITION,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY,DOSE,CALCULATION,QUALITY,IMPLEMENTATION,RADIOTHERAPY,DELINEATION,ACCURACY,NUMBERS,HEAD",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

In hospital treatment and telemedicine, experts conduct pathological analysis and treat patients with fundus diseases using retinal images that are captured by fundus cameras. The quality of fundus images is therefore crucial for doctors to provide timely and accurate diagnoses of the diseases. However, the different experiences of fundus photographers result in different image qualities, and some images are marked as unreadable by the diagnostician, seriously delaying the treatment of patients. To solve the quality classification problem, a modified residual dense block convolution neural network (MRDB-CNN) is proposed in this paper. The two categories of images, ""good quality"" and ""poor quality"", are used as the training data set and testing data set to train the CNNs and verify the classification results. The experimental results show that, compared with other existing network structures, the network proposed in this paper can classify the ""good-quality"" and ""poor-quality"" fundus images more accurately with an accuracy rate of 99.90%. In addition, the tests for the ""ambiguous-quality"" category further demonstrate that our method can obtain more detailed features of the fundus images and give an objective score to the image quality. In short, the MRDB-CNN can accurately classify the quality of fundus images while avoiding the complex preprocessing of traditional algorithms, and it satisfies the needs of hospital treatment and telemedicine for the real-time quality judgement of fundus images.","Colour fundus image,Quality classification,Deep learning,MRDB-CNN",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,SEGMENTATION,SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING,,

The diagnosis of sleep apnea is possible by the detection of apnea events using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. This paper introduces an adaptive decomposition for the detection of apnea events using EEG signals. In introduced decomposition, the evolutionary techniques (ETs) optimized Hermite functions (HFs) represent the EEG signals. In tested ETs, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm provides the least reconstruction error for the representation of EEG signals. The ABC is considered for Hermite coefficients-based feature extraction. From the extracted features, a highly discriminative feature set is obtained using the Fisher-score ranking test. The apnea detection performance of ranking-based selected features is evaluated using the extreme learning machine and least-squares support vector machine classifiers. The proposed method obtained performance measures, sensitivity 99.47, specificity 99.58, and accuracy 99.53, are better as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","Electroencephalography,Feature extraction,Sleep apnea,Hafnium,Support vector machines,Biological cells,Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal,evolutionary techniques,extreme learning machine (ELM),Hermite functions (HFs),sleep apnea",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,3.953,"RECOGNITION,ECG,ALGORITHMS,TRANSFORM,MACHINE,MODEL",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT,,

The proposed method dynamically targets a machine for the next process by identifying diverse production conditions. We use a deep neural network-based dynamic scheduling method considering the overall production environment, which includes the remaining processing time, facility states, transportation time and traffic congestion, work-in-process distribution, and intermediate buffer states. To demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted experimental studies to compare the proposed model with the existing priority rule-based and analytic models under the static and dynamic environments.

The DBT system obtains several projection images at a limited range of view angle and thus reduces the radiation dose delivered to patient effectively. Back projection (BP) is a classic algorithm for image reconstruction. In this work, 25 projection images were acquired by simulating seven different geometry configurations of X-ray sources on GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission) platform. BP algorithm and its two variants (i.e., alpha-trimmed BP and PCA-based BP) were used for image reconstruction. Our experimental results demonstrated that among the seven geometry configurations of X-ray sources, the rectangular non-uniform configuration performed the best; it showed a better capability in eliminating out-of-plane artifacts and resolving spatial details than others. In addition, the a-trimmed BP had a better image quality among all of the three algorithms in the modulation transfer function analysis.","Breast cancer,Digital breast tomosynthesis,Image reconstruction,Image quality,Back projection",Article,"ELSEVIER GMBH, HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",Optics,,1.955,,OPTIK,,

Laser-based standoff detection techniques can help to provide information about the thread without direct contact of humans to the hazardous materials. This article explains a data acquisition and classification procedure for laser-induced fluorescence spectra of several chemical agents. The substances are excited from a distance of 3.5 m by laser pulses of two UV wavelengths (266 and 355 nm) with less than 0.1 mJ per laser pulse and a repetition rate of 100 Hz. Each pair of simultaneously emitted laser pulses is separated using an optical delay line. Every measurement consists of a dataset of 100 spectra per wavelength containing the signal intensities in the spectral range from 250 to 680 nm, recorded by a 32-channel photo multiplying tube array. Based on this dataset, three classification algorithms are trained which can distinguish the samples by their single spectra with an accuracy of over 98%.

We sought to determine whether machine learning could help predict the presence of bladder injury using certain factors at the time of presentation of blunt pelvic trauma.
Materials and methods: Adult patients at a Level I trauma center with blunt trauma pelvic fractures from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 were identified. Patients with admission urinalysis data, fracture ICD 9 codes, and mechanism of injury available in the trauma registry were included. Patients with bladder rupture and pelvic fracture were compared to those with pelvic fracture alone. The classification of results was performed using the MATLAB Classification Learner Tool. The classification performances were tested by machine learning algorithms in the domains of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Ensemble classifiers.
Results: Of the 3063 eligible pelvic fracture patients identified, 208 (6.8%) had concomitant bladder ruptures. Twenty machine learning algorithms were then tested based on pelvic fracture ICD-9 code, admission urinalysis, and mechanism of injury. The best classification results were obtained using the Gaussian Naive Bayes and Kernel Naive Bayes classifiers, both with accuracy of 97.8%, specificity of 99%, sensitivity of 83%, and area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of 0.99.
Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms can be used to help predict with a high level of accuracy the presence of bladder rupture with blunt pelvic trauma using readily available information at the time of presentation. This has the potential to improve selection of patients for additional imaging, while also more appropriately allocating hospital resources and reducing patient risks.

Methods: We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Results: Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment.

Methods: The system consists of an earpiece, which measures the ear canal temperature every 5& x00A0;min during night sleep hours, and a base station that transmits data to a smartphone application for analysis. We establish a data-cleaning protocol for data preprocessing and then fit a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with two hidden states of high and low temperature to identify the more probable state of each time point via the predicted probabilities. Finally, a post-processing procedure is developed to incorporate biorhythm information to form a time-course biphasic profile for each subject.

Methods: Our algorithm first transforms iEEG time series from each electrode into symbolic local binary pattern codes, from which a holographic distributed representation of the brain state of interest is constructed across all the electrodes and over time in a hyperdimensional space. The representation is used to quickly learn from few seizures, detect their onset, and identify the spatial brain regions that generated them. Results: We assess our algorithm on our dataset that contains 99 short-time iEEG recordings from 16 drug-resistant epilepsy patients being implanted with 36-100 electrodes. For the majority of the patients (ten out of 16), our algorithm quickly learns from one or two seizures and perfectly (100%) generalizes on novel seizures using k-fold cross-validation. For the remaining six patients, the algorithm requires three to six seizures for learning. Our algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art including deep learning algorithms by achieving higher specificity (94.84% versus 94.77%) and macroaveraging accuracy (95.42% versus 94.96%), and 74x lower memory footprint, but slightly higher average latency in detection (15.9 s versus 14.7 s). Moreover, the algorithm can reliably identify (with a p-value < 0.01) the relevant electrodes covering an ictogenic brain region at two levels of granularity: cerebral hemispheres and lobes. Conclusion and significance: Our algorithm provides: 1) a unified method for both learning and classification tasks with end-to-end binary operations; 2) one-shot learning from seizure examples; 3) linear computational scalability for increasing number of electrodes; and 4) generation of transparent codes that enables post-translational support for clinical decision making.

The process is specifically tailored for characterizing the MPs' ""holographic signatures,"" thus boosting the classification performance and reaching accuracy higher than 99% in classifying thousands of items.

Firstly, we design a novel network architecture with multiple segmentation tasks, called Deep Interval-Marker-Aware Network, for learning the foreground, marker, and interval of nuclei, simultaneously. Then the learned interval between overlapping nuclei is used to refine the foreground result of nuclei by using the logical operators. Finally, the learned marker result and the nuclei segmentation result refined by interval are transmitted into the Marker-controlled Watershed for splitting the touching nuclei.

Expanding this work here, we develop a novel sampling strategy based on the physics/pattern-guided data distribution. Our adaptive sampling strategy relies on enrichment of sub-manifolds based on the principal stretches and rotational sensitivity analysis. This novel sampling strategy substantially decreases the number of snapshots needed for accurate reduced order model construction (i.e., similar to 5x reduction of snapshots over Bhattacharjee and Matous (2016)).

The purpose of this report is to examine the utility of a mass spectrometry-based blood serum protein biomarker test for detection of CRC.
Materials and methods: Blood was drawn from individuals (n = 213) before colonoscopy or from patients with nonmetastatic CRC (n = 50) before surgery. Proteins were isolated from the serum of patients using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We designed a machine-learning statistical model to assess these proteins.
Results: When considered individually, over 70% of the selected biomarkers showed significance by Mann-Whitney testing for distinguishing cancer-bearing cases from cancer-free cases. Using machine-learning methods, peptides derived from epidermal growth factor receptor and leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 were consistently identified as highly predictive for detecting CRC from cancer-free cases. A five-marker panel consisting of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy-chain family member 4, hemopexin, and superoxide dismutase 3 performed the best with 70% specificity at over 89% sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.86) in the validation set. For distinguishing regional from localized cancers, cross-validation within the training set showed that a panel of four proteins consisting of CD44 molecule, GC-vitamin D-binding protein, C-reactive protein, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy-chain family member 3 yielded the highest performance (area under the curve = 0.75).
Conclusions: The minimally invasive blood biomarker panels identified here could serve as screening/detection alternatives for CRC in a human population and potentially useful for staging of existing cancer.

Therefore, diagnosis of AD has been mostly performed by analyzing brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological tests. Identifying the molecular-level mechanism of AD has been lacking data owing to the difficulty of sampling in the posterior brains of normal and AD patients; however, recent studies have produced and analyzed large-scale omics data for brain areas such as prefrontal cortex. Therefore, it is necessary to develop AD diagnosis or prediction methods based on these data.
Results: This paper proposed a deep learning-based model that can predict AD using large-scale gene expression and DNA methylation data. The most challenging problem in constructing a model to diagnose AD based on the multi-omics dataset is how to integrate different omics data and how to deal with high-dimensional and low-sample-size data. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel but simple approach to reduce the number of features based on a differentially expressed gene and a differentially methylated position in the multi-omics dataset. Moreover, we developed a deep neural network-based prediction model that improves performance compared to that of conventional machine learning algorithms. The feature selection method and the prediction model presented in this paper outperformed conventional machine learning algorithms, which utilize typical dimension reduction methods. In addition, we demonstrated that integrating gene expression and DNA methylation data could improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that the sample containing the highest amount of gelatin and genipin had the highest degree of crosslinking and increasing the percentage of genipin from 0.125% to 0.5% enhances ultimate tensile strength (UTS) up to 113% and 92%, for samples with 2.5% and 10% gelatin, respectively. For these samples, increasing the percentage of genipin, reduce their degradation rate significantly with an average value of 124%. Furthermore, experimental data are used to develop a machine learning model, which compares artificial neural networks (ANN) and kernel ridge regression (KRR) to predict degradation rate of genipin-cross-linked gelatin scaffolds as a property of interest. The predicted degradation rate demonstrates that the ANN, with mean squared error (MSE) of 2.68%, outperforms the KRR with MSE = 4.78% in terms of accuracy. These results suggest that machine learning models offer an excellent prediction accuracy to estimate the degradation rate which will significantly help reducing experimental costs needed to carry out scaffold design.","Tissue engineering,Engineering scaffolds,Degradation rate,Prediction accuracy",Article,"ELSEVIER, RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Materials Science,,6.654,"IN-VITRO,TRICALCIUM,PHOSPHATE,DESIGN,NETWORKS,DELIVERY,MICROSPHERES",MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,

In terms of hydrated cementitious materials, such interactions often result in the chemo-physical-mechanical (CPM) degradation, which represents a multiphysics process of high non-linearity and complexity. By further considering the inevitable uncertainties associated with both the materials and the serving conditions, solving such a process requires novel probabilistic approaches. This paper presents a stochastic chemo-physical-mechanical (SCPM) degradation analysis on the hydrated cement under acidic environment. The SCPM analysis consists of modelling the stochastic chemophysical degradation by finite element method, and assessing the mechanical deterioration through analytical micromechanics. The proposed modelling framework couples the conventional Monte Carlo Simulation with a novel support vector regression algorithm. The present method is able to not only address the detailed degradation mechanisms, but also ensure low computational costs for an accurate SCPM degradation assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The uncertain system parameters, which include the material properties, dimensions of structural members, applied loads, as well as the degree of gradation of the functionally graded material (FGM), can be incorporated within a unified structural reliability analysis framework. A 3D finite element method (FEM) for static analysis of bar-type engineering structures involving FGM is presented. By extending the traditional support vector regression (SVR) method, a new kernel-based machine learning technique, namely the extended support vector regression (X-SVR), is proposed for modelling the underpinned relationship between the structural behaviours and the uncertain system inputs. The proposed structural reliability analysis inherits the advantages of the traditional sampling method (i.e., Monte-Carlo Simulation) on providing the information regarding the statistical characteristics (i.e., mean, standard deviations, probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions etc.) of any concerned structural outputs, but with significantly reduced computational efforts. Five numerical examples are investigated to illustrate the accuracy, applicability, and computational efficiency of the proposed computational scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Material and methods: Six machine-learning algorithms were applied to predict 30-day QALY for 777 patients admitted in a prospective cohort study conducted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of two public Brazilian hospitals specialized in cancer care. The predictors were 37 characteristics collected at ICU admission. Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Sensitivity, 1-specificity, true/false positive and negative cases were measured for different estimated probability cutoff points (30%, 20% and 10%). Calibration was evaluated with GiViTI calibration belt and test.
Results: Except for basic decision trees, the adjusted predictive models were nearly equivalent, presenting good results for discrimination (AUROC curves over 0.80). Artificial neural networks and gradient boosted trees achieved the overall best calibration, implying an accurately predicted probability for 30-day QALY.
Conclusions: Except for basic decision trees, predictive models derived from different machine-learning algorithms discriminated the QALY risk at 30 days well. Regarding calibration, artificial neural network model presented the best ability to estimate 30-day QALY in critically ill oncologic patients admitted to ICUs.

Available breast cancer datasets are unbalanced in nature, i.e. there are more instances of benign (non-cancerous) cases then malignant (cancerous) ones. Therefore, it is a challenging task for most machine learning (ML) models to classify between benign and malignant cases properly, even though they have high accuracy. Accuracy is not a good metric to assess the results of ML models on breast cancer dataset because of biased results. To address this issue, we use Genetic Programming (GP) and propose two fitness functions. First one is F2 score which focuses on learning more about the minority class, which contains more relevant information, the second one is a novel fitness function known as Distance score (D score) which learns about both the classes by giving them equal importance and being unbiased. The GP framework in which we implemented D score is named as D-score GP (DGP) and the framework implemented with F2 score is named as F2GP. The proposed F2GP achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.63%, 99.51% and 100% for 60-40, 70-30 partition schemes and 10 fold cross validation scheme respectively and DGP achieves a maximum accuracy of 99.63%, 98.5% and 100% in 60-40, 70-30 partition schemes and 10 fold cross validation scheme respectively. The proposed models also achieves a recall of 100% for all the test cases. This shows that using a new fitness function for unbalanced data classification improves the performance of a classifier.

Unfortunately, due to the instinct time-variation, the small-sample condition and the uncertainty caused by the drifting of raw materials, it is exceedingly difficult to model the fed-batch processes, for instance, rubber internal mixing processing. Meanwhile, traditional global learning algorithms suffer from the outdated samples while online learning algorithms lack practicality since too many labelled samples of current batch are required to build the soft sensor. In this paper, semi-supervised hybrid local kernel regression (SHLKR) is presented to leverage both historical and online samples to semi-supervised model the soft sensor using proposed time-windows series. Moreover, the recursive formulas are deduced to improve its adaptability and feasibility. Additionally, the rubber Mooney soft sensor of internal mixing processing is implemented using real onsite data to validate proposed method. Compared with classical algorithms, the performance of SHLKR is evaluated and the contribution of unlabelled samples is discussed.","SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION,QUALITY PREDICTION,LEAST-SQUARES,SELECTION",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Engineering,Polymer Science",,2.368,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,REGRESSION,QUALITY,PREDICTION,LEAST-SQUARES,SELECTION",ADVANCES IN POLYMER TECHNOLOGY,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6981302,
