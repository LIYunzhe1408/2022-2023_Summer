Our approach discriminates the factors of both bulk and grain boundary conductivities, which have been rarely reported. The effects of the interrelated structural (e.g. grain size, phase), material (e.g. Li ratio), chemical (e.g. electronegativity, polarizability) and experimental (e.g. sintering temperature, synthesis method) properties on the bulk and grain boundary conductivities are investigated via machine learning. The data are trained using the bulk and grain boundary conductivities of Li solid conductors at room temperature. The important descriptors are elucidated by their feature importance and predictive performances, as determined by a nonlinear XGBoost algorithm: (i) the experimental descriptors of sintering conditions are significant for both bulk and grain boundary, (ii) the material descriptors of Li site occupancy and Li ratio are the prior descriptors for bulk, (iii) the density and unit cell volume are the prior structural descriptors while the polarizability and electronegativity are the prior chemical descriptors for grain boundary, (iv) the grain size provides physical insights such as the thermodynamic condition and should be considered for determining grain boundary conductance in solid polycrystalline ionic conductors.","Ionic conductivity,machine learning,grain boundary,ionic conductor,Li battery,grain size,descriptor",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,6.963,"LITHIUM,IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY,ELECTROCHEMICAL,PROPERTIES,SINTERING,TEMPERATURE,LANTHANUM,TITANATE,GEL,SYNTHESIS,ALUMINUM,ELECTRONEGATIVITY,LI7LA3ZR2O12,PERFORMANCE,INTERFACE",SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594868,
2,Multichannel Deep Attention Neural Networks for the Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Neuroimaging and Personal Characteristic Data,2020,,,"Niu Ke,Guo Jiayang,Pan Yijie,Gao Xin,Peng Xueping,Li Ning,Li Hailong","Niu K,Guo JY,Pan YJ,Gao X,Peng XP,Li N,Li HL",Peng XP,10.1155/2020/1357853,University of Technology Sydney,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that impacts more than 1.6% of children aged 8 across the United States. It is characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as by a restricted repertoire of activity and interests. The current standardized clinical diagnosis of ASD remains to be a subjective diagnosis, mainly relying on behavior-based tests. However, the diagnostic process for ASD is not only time consuming, but also costly, causing a tremendous financial burden for patients' families. Therefore, automated diagnosis approaches have been an attractive solution for earlier identification of ASD. In this work, we set to develop a deep learning model for automated diagnosis of ASD. Specifically, a multichannel deep attention neural network (DANN) was proposed by integrating multiple layers of neural networks, attention mechanism, and feature fusion to capture the interrelationships in multimodality data. We evaluated the proposed multichannel DANN model on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repository with 809 subjects (408 ASD patients and 401 typical development controls). Our model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.732 on ASD classification by integrating three scales of brain functional connectomes and personal characteristic data, outperforming multiple peer machine learning models in a k-fold cross validation experiment. Additional k-fold and leave-one-site-out cross validation were conducted to test the generalizability and robustness of the proposed multichannel DANN model. The results show promise for deep learning models to aid the future automated clinical diagnosis of ASD.","CHILDREN,IQ",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Mathematics,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,2.8,"CHILDREN,IQ",COMPLEXITY,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/138316/1/complexity-2020-1357853.pdf,

Six inter-laboratory testing programs are being executed by the EU COST action SARCOS, each focusing on test methods for a specific self-healing technique. This paper reports on the comparison of tests for mortar and concrete specimens with polyurethane encapsulated in glass macrocapsules. First, the pre-cracking method was analysed: mortar specimens were cracked in a three-point bending test followed by an active crack width control technique to restrain the crack width up to a predefined value, while the concrete specimens were cracked in a three-point bending setup with a displacement-controlled loading system. Microscopic measurements showed that with the application of the active control technique almost all crack widths were within a narrow predefined range. Conversely, for the concrete specimens the variation on the crack width was higher. After pre-cracking, the self-healing effect was characterized via durability tests: the mortar specimens were tested in a water permeability test and the spread of the healing agent on the crack surfaces was determined, while the concrete specimens were subjected to two capillary water absorption tests, executed with a different type of waterproofing applied on the zone around the crack. The quality of the waterproofing was found to be important, as different results were obtained in each absorption test. For the permeability test, 4 out of 6 labs obtained a comparable flow rate for the reference specimens, yet all 6 labs obtained comparable sealing efficiencies, highlighting the potential for further standardization.","Round robin test,self-healing concrete,standardization,macrocapsules,polyurethane,capillary water absorption,water permeability,active crack width control technique,machine learning",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Materials Science,,6.963,"CEMENT-BASED,MATERIALS,SUPERABSORBENT,POLYMERS,WATER,PERFORMANCE,VISUALIZATION,ABSORPTION,REPAIR,CRACKS",SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14686996.2020.1814117?needAccess=true,

By using the selected dominating factors as input variables, an optimized random forest model was established with a high prediction accuracy of corrosion rate (R(2)values, 0.94 and 0.73 to the training set and testing set) to different low-alloy steel samples in several typical marine atmospheric environments.

Although many previously observed NMR spectra are accumulated in public databases, they cover only a tiny fraction of the chemical space, and molecule identification is typically accomplished manually based on expert knowledge. Herein, we propose NMR-TS, a machine-learning-based python library, to automatically identify a molecule from its NMR spectrum. NMR-TS discovers candidate molecules whose NMR spectra match the target spectrum by using deep learning and density functional theory (DFT)-computed spectra. As a proof-of-concept, we identify prototypical metabolites from their computed spectra. After an average 5451 DFT runs for each spectrum, six of the nine molecules are identified correctly, and proximal molecules are obtained in the other cases. This encouraging result implies that de novo molecule generation can contribute to the fully automated identification of chemical structures.

It is argued that classical conditioning, being one of the most elementary forms of learning, inspires algorithmic realizations in synthetic materials, to allow stimuli-responsive materials that learn to respond to a new stimulus, to which they are originally insensitive. Two synthetic model systems coined as ""Pavlovian materials"" are described, whose stimuli-responsiveness algorithmically mimics programmable associative learning, inspired by classical conditioning. The concepts minimally need a stimulus-triggerable memory, in addition to two stimuli, i.e., the unconditioned and the originally neutral stimuli. Importantly, the concept differs conceptually from the classic stimuli-responsive and shape-memory materials, as, upon association, Pavlovian materials obtain a given response using a new stimulus (the originally neutral one); i.e., the system evolves to a new state. This also enables the functionality to be described by a logic diagram. Ample room for generalization to different stimuli and memory combinations is foreseen, and opportunities to develop future adaptive materials with ever-more intelligent functions are expected.","adaptation,associative learning,biomimetics,classical conditioning,stimuli-responsive materials",Article,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH, POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","Chemistry,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Materials Science,Physics",,30.254,"LIQUID-CRYSTALLINE,ELASTOMERS,STIMULI-RESPONSIVE,POLYMERS,SHAPE-MEMORY,POLYMERS,LOGIC,GATES,HYDROGELS,ACTUATORS,NETWORKS,SYSTEMS,MODELS,DRIVEN",ADVANCED MATERIALS,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/adma.201906619,

We evaluated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was associated with poor outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) using machine learning approach.
Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 328 patients within 7 days of AIS onset. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was obtained within 24 h of hospital admission. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6. Logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting algorithm were used to assess association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with poor outcome. Prediction performances were compared with area under ROC curve and F1 score.
Results: Mean age of patients was 67.6 +/- 13.3 years. Of 328 patients, 59.1% were men. Median 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 10.4 (interquartile range, 7.1-14.8) ng/mL and 47.2% of patients were 25-hydroxyvitamin D-deficient (<10 ng/mL). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was a predictor for poor outcome in multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-9.18, p = 0.017). Stroke severity, age, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D level were also significant predictors in extreme gradient boosting classification algorithm. Performance of extreme gradient boosting algorithm was comparable to those of logistic regression (AUROC, 0.805 vs. 0.746, p = 0.11).
Conclusions: 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in Korea and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was associated with poor outcome in patients with AIS. The machine learning approach of extreme gradient boosting was also useful to assess stroke prognosis along with logistic regression analysis.","vitamin D,cerebral infarction,stroke,outcome assessment,machine learning",Article,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA, AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Neurosciences & Neurology,,,"VITAMIN-D,STATUS,CIRCULATING,ENDOTHELIAL,MICROPARTICLES,CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE,MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,D,SUPPLEMENTATION,BRACHIAL-ARTERY,D,PREDICTS,MORTALITY,SEVERITY,OUTCOMES",FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7005206?pdf=render,

Statistical learning models were trained and validated on 62,844 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We used balanced logistic regression-random forest ensemble classifiers and proportional hazards models to learn multivariate patterns of association between malignancy, survival, and a series of basic clinical variables-such as tumor size, location, and surgical procedure. We demonstrate that our models are capable of predicting meaningful individual-specific clinical outcome variables and show good generalizability across 16 SEER registries. A free smartphone and web application is provided for readers to access and test the predictive models (). Future model improvements and prospective replication will be necessary to demonstrate true clinical utility. Rather than being used in isolation, we expect that the proposed models will be integrated into larger and more comprehensive models that integrate imaging and molecular biomarkers.

18,A preliminary attempt to visualize nigrosome 1 in the substantia nigra for Parkinson's disease at 3T: An efficient susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) with quantitative susceptibility mapping using deep neural network (QSMnet),47,3,1151-1160,"Jo Minju,Oh Se-Hong","Jo M,Oh SH",Oh SH,10.1002/mp.13999,Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Purpose Visibility of nigrosome 1 in the substantia nigra (SN) is used as an MR imaging biomarker for Parkinson's disease. Because of lower susceptibility induced tissue contrast and SNR visualization of the SN pars compacta (SNPC) using conventional imaging technique in the clinical field strength (<= 3T) has been limited. Susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) has been proposed to visualize SNPC at 3T. To better visualize nigrosome 1 and SN areas using SMWI, accurate estimation of the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) map is essential. In SMWI processing, however, QSM processing time using conventional algorithms is the most time-consuming step and may limit clinical use. In this study, we introduce an efficient SMWI processing approach using the deep neural network (QSMnet). To improve the processing speed of SMWI while maintaining similar image quality to that obtained with the conventional method, QSMnet was applied to generate a susceptibility mask for SMWI processing. Methods To conduct a deep learning-based image to image operation modified QSMnet was utilized. The network was trained with in vivo MR data from 57 healthy controls. To validate SMWI results from QSMnet, four datasets from healthy controls were used as the test datasets. As a preliminary attempt to explore the clinical applicability, Parkinson's disease patient data were additionally tested. The SWMI images generated by QSMnet and conventional model-based QSM outputs were compared. To validate SMWI results, region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed. The mean signal values at the nigrosome 1 and the surrounding regions were measured to calculate contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Results The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach using QSMnet provided similar QSM and SMWI compared to that obtained with conventional iLSQR while the processing speed was much improved (5.4 times faster). The QSM results from QSMnet show similar tissue contrast with results from iLSQR. When compared, the absolute mean intensity difference between two methods near the nigrosome 1 was 0.015 ppm. SMWI results using susceptibility masks from QSMnet demonstrated signal distribution and tissue contrast that was comparable with those results from the conventional iLSQR method. The absolute difference maps of SMWI were calculated to show the similarity between the two methods. The overall mean absolute difference value in the presented ROIs obtained from healthy controls (n = 4) and a PD patient (n = 1) were 2.31 and 1.81, respectively. Mean CNR values (10 ROIs; n = 5; including both sides; 1.42 for QSMnet; 1.43 for iLSQR) between SN and nigrosome 1 in SMWI results obtained by ROI analysis were similar (P = 0.724). Conclusions In this study, we assessed an efficient approach for SMWI visualizing SN and nigrosome 1 on 3T. QSMnet provides a similar SMWI image to that obtained with the conventional iterative QSM algorithm and improves QSM processing speed by avoiding iterative computation. Since QSM is the most time-consuming step of SMWI processing, QSMnet can help to achieve a higher processing speed of SMWI. These results suggest that SMWI imaging with susceptibility masks using QSMnet is a more efficient approach.","deep neural network,Nigrosome 1,Parkinson's disease,PD,QSM,QSMnet,SMWI",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"BRAIN,MRI,DIAGNOSIS,COSMOS,IMAGES",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

This material is of interest for application in phase change non-volatile memories. The resulting lattice thermal conductivity of an ultrathin nanowire (7.3 nm diameter) of 1.57 W m(-1) K-1 is sizably lower than the corresponding bulk value of 3.15 W m(-1) K-1 obtained within the same framework. The analysis of the phonon dispersion relations and lifetimes reveals that the lower thermal conductivity in the nanowire is mostly due to a reduction in the phonon group velocities. We further predict the presence of a minimum in the lattice thermal conductivity for thicker nanowires.,"phase change materials,nanowires,neural networks,thermal transport,molecular,dynamics simulations",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",Physics,,3.041,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS,https://escholarship.org/content/qt56f9s9dj/qt56f9s9dj.pdf?t=qg1waw,

Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.","damage detection,deep learning,Faster RCNN,earthquake reconnaissance,UAV",Article,"JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD, THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,4.76,"AUTOMATIC,CRACK,DETECTION,CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,VISION,IMAGES,CLASSIFICATION",STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING,,

Manual detection of lung nodules by the radiologist is a sequential and time-consuming process. The detection is subjective and depends on the radiologist's experiences. Owing to the variation in shapes and appearances of a lung nodule, it is very difficult to identify the proper location of the nodule from a huge number of slices generated by the CT scanner. Small nodules (< 10 mm in diameter) may be missed by this manual detection process. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system acts as a ""second opinion"" for the radiologists, by making final decision quickly with higher accuracy and greater confidence. The goal of this survey work is to present the current state of the artworks and their progress towards lung nodule detection to the researchers and readers in this domain. This review paper has covered the published works from 2009 to April 2018. Different nodule detection approaches are described elaborately in this work. Recently, it is observed that deep learning (DL)-based approaches are applied extensively for nodule detection and characterization.

BreakHis is organized into four magnification levels, each image is labeled according to its main category (Benign/Malignant) and its subcategory (A/F/PT/TA/PC/DC/LC/MC). This organization allows practitioners to address this problem either as a binary or a multi-category classification task with either a magnification dependent or independent training approach.

Thus, timely and accurate pothole detection is an important task in developing proper maintenance strategies and ensuring driving safety. This paper proposes a method of integrating the processing of grayscale and texture features. This method mainly combines industrial camera to realize rapid and accurate detection of pothole. Image processing techniques including texture filters, image grayscale, morphology, and extraction of the maximum connected domain are used synergistically to extract useful features from digital images. A machine learning model based on the library for support vector machine (LIBSVM) is constructed to distinguish potholes from longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, and complex cracks. The method is validated using data collected from agricultural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, China. The comprehensive experiments for recognition of potholes show that the recall, precision, and F1-Score achieved are 100%, 97.4%, and 98.7%, respectively. In addition, the overlap rate between the extracted pothole region and the original image is estimated. Images with an overlap rate greater than 90% accounted for 76.8% of the total image, and images with an overlap rate greater than 80% accounted for 94% of the total image. A comparison discloses that the proposed approach is superior to the existing method not only from the perspective of the accuracy of pothole detection but also from the perspective of the segmentation effect and processing efficiency.","ASPHALT PAVEMENT,FEATURES,SYSTEM",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Engineering,Mathematics",,1.27,"ASPHALT,PAVEMENT,FEATURES,SYSTEM",MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1360832,

Difficulties in traditional approaches deal with extremely heterogeneous intensity caused by lesions, abnormal anatomy structures, and blurring boundaries of cavity. 2D and 3D deep convolutional neural networks have grown popular in medical image segmentation due to utilization of large labeled datasets to learn discriminative features. However, for 3D segmentation in medical images, 2D networks are not competent in extracting more significant spacial features, and 3D ones suffer from unbearable burden of computation, which results in great challenges to maxillary sinus segmentation. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network with an end-to-end manner to generalize a fully automatic 3D segmentation. At first, our proposed model serves a symmetrical encoder-decoder architecture for multitask of bounding box estimation and in-region 3D segmentation, which cannot reduce excessive computation requirements but eliminate false positives remarkably, promoting 3D segmentation applied in 3D convolutional neural networks. In addition, an overestimation strategy is presented to avoid overfitting phenomena in conventional multitask networks. Meanwhile, we introduce residual dense blocks to increase the depth of the proposed network and attention excitation mechanism to improve the performance of bounding box estimation, both of which bring little influence to computation cost. Especially, the structure of multilevel feature fusion in the pyramid network strengthens the ability of identification to global and local discriminative features in foreground and background achieving more advanced segmentation results. At last, to address problems of blurring boundary and class imbalance in medical images, a hybrid loss function is designed for multiple tasks. To illustrate the strength of our proposed model, we evaluated it against the state-of-the-art methods.

For these reasons, the role of rapid MR imaging is important. In this study, we propose the joint reconstruction of multicontrast brain MR images from down-sampled data to accelerate the data acquisition process using a novel deep-learning network. Methods Twenty-one healthy volunteers (female/male = 7/14, age = 26 +/- 4 yr, range 22-35 yr) and 16 postoperative patients (female/male = 7/9, age = 49 +/- 9 yr, range 37-62 yr) were scanned on a 3T whole-body scanner for prospective and retrospective studies, respectively, using both T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) and T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences. We proposed a network which we term ""X-net"" to reconstruct both T1- and T2-weighted images from down-sampled images as well as a network termed ""Y-net"" which reconstructs T2-weighted images from highly down-sampled T2-weighted images and fully sampled T1-weighted images. Both X-net and Y-net are composed of two concatenated subnetworks. We investigate optimal sampling patterns, the optimal patch size for augmentation, and the optimal acceleration factors for network training. An additional Y-net combined with a generative adversarial network (GAN) was also implemented and tested to investigate the effects of the GAN on the Y-net performance. Single- and joint-reconstruction parallel-imaging and compressed-sensing algorithms along with a conventional U-net were also tested and compared with the proposed networks. For this comparison, the structural similarity (SSIM), normalized mean square error (NMSE), and Frechet inception distance (FID) were calculated between the outputs of the networks and fully sampled images. The statistical significance of the performance was evaluated by assessing the interclass correlation and in paired t-tests. Results The outputs from the two concatenated subnetworks were closer to the fully sampled images compared to those from one subnetwork, with this result showing statistical significance. Uniform down-sampling led to a statically significant improvement in the image quality compared to random or central down-sampling patterns. In addition, the proposed networks provided higher SSIM and NMSE values than U-net, compressed-sensing, and parallel-imaging algorithms, all at statistically significant levels. The GAN-based Y-net showed a better FID and more realistic images compared to a non-GAN-based Y-net. The performance capabilities of the networks were similar between normal subjects and patients. Conclusions The proposed X-net and Y-net effectively reconstructed full images from down-sampled images, outperforming the conventional parallel-imaging, compressed-sensing and U-net methods and providing more realistic images in combination with a GAN. The developed networks potentially enable us to accelerate multicontrast anatomical MR imaging in routine clinical studies including T1-and T2-weighted imaging.","deep learning,multicontrast MRI,x-net,y-net",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"NEURAL-NETWORK,ANGIOGRAPHY,VENOGRAPHY,ACQUISITION,BRAIN",MEDICAL PHYSICS,,

Moreover, experimentally, some issues are also of importance; first, it is imperative to work at sufficiently high concentrations to reach the sensitivities of the analytical tools, however this condition often leads to precipitation for some of them; second, stabilizing specific oxidation states of some actinides remains a challenge, thus making it difficult to extract general trends across the actinide series. Complementary to experiments, modeling can be used to unbiasedly probe the actinide's properties in an aquatic environment and offers a predictive tool. We report the first molecular dynamics simulations based on homogeneously built force fields for the whole series of the tetravalent actinides in aqueous phase from Th-IV to Bk-IV and including Pu-IV.

Through early detection and diagnosis, there is a great chance of recovery and thereby reduce the mortality rate. Many preliminary tests like non-invasive radiological diagnosis using ultrasound, mammography, and MRI are widely used for the diagnosis of breast cancer. However, histopathological analysis of breast biopsy specimen is inevitable and is considered to be the golden standard for the affirmation of cancer. With the advancements in the digital computing capabilities, memory capacity, and imaging modalities, the development of computer-aided powerful analytical techniques for histopathological data has increased dramatically. These automated techniques help to alleviate the laborious work of the pathologist and to improve the reproducibility and reliability of the interpretation. This paper reviews and summarizes digital image computational algorithms applied on histopathological breast cancer images for nuclear atypia scoring and explores the future possibilities. The algorithms for nuclear pleomorphism scoring of breast cancer can be widely grouped into two categories: handcrafted feature-based and learned feature-based. Handcrafted feature-based algorithms mainly include the computational steps like pre-processing the images, segmenting the nuclei, extracting unique features, feature selection, and machine learning-based classification. However, most of the recent algorithms are based on learned features, that extract high-level abstractions directly from the histopathological images utilizing deep learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss the various algorithms applied for the nuclear pleomorphism scoring of breast cancer, discourse the challenges to be dealt with, and outline the importance of benchmark datasets. A comparative analysis of some prominent works on breast cancer nuclear atypia scoring is done using a benchmark dataset which enables to quantitatively measure and compare the different features and algorithms used for breast cancer grading.

Two clustering centers of the vessel and background classes were obtained by performing affinity propagation clustering on the feature space. Based on these clustering centers, the fundus pixels were classified via the nearest neighbor method for retinal vessel segmentation. The experimental results show that the accuracies arc 94.63% and 94.30% for the DRIVE and STARE fundus image databases, respectively.

This paper employs Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) - a machine learning method - to investigate the contributions of a variety of influencing factors to runway and taxiway pavement deterioration at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. By adopting a systematic procedure consisting of model training, validation, and testing, two separate GBM models are developed to estimate Pavement Condition Index (PCI) of runways and taxiways. The models account for various input variables that are believed to affect pavement deterioration, including pavement age and material, maintenance and rehabilitation history, weather conditions, and air traffic loading effects. The developed GBM models are shown to outperform other methods (including linear regression, nonlinear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest) in terms of model goodness-of-fit for both runway and taxiway pavements. The GBM modelling results are subsequently used to interpret the influence of individual input variables as well as their interactions on PCI, using relative importance and partial dependence plots. With promising results, the study demonstrates the use of an approach that was not previously considered in infrastructure management and can help airport agencies enhance the ability to understand airport asset performance.","Machine learning,gradient boosting machine (GBM),asset management,pavement condition Index (PCI),contribution of inputs",Article,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD, 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering,Materials Science",,4.03,"DECISION,TREES,PERFORMANCE,PREDICTION,REGRESSION,MODELS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING,,

The proposed model is derived partly based on the measured burning velocities of syngas-air mixtures at elevated temperatures and pressures using diverging channel method, and partly established from the predictions using the FFCM-1 detailed kinetic model. The experiments at elevated pressures and temperature strongly agree with the predictions of the FFCM-1 kinetic model for PG1 (H-2/CO/CO2/N-2 = 15/15/15/55) syngas composition. Based on the detailed analysis of the experimental results, a power-law correlation considering the alpha, beta variations is proposed: S-u = S-u,S-o *(T-u/T-u,T-o)(alpha 0+alpha 1(1-Pu/Pu,o)) * (P-u/P-u,P-o)(beta 0+beta 1 (1-Tu/Tu,o)).
Machine learning model (multiple linear-regression) was trained for the variables (S-u,S-o, alpha(0), alpha(1), beta(0), beta(1)) in the power-law correlation to enable the prediction of laminar burning velocity at various pressure and temperature conditions. The empirical model was developed with mole fractions of various components (H-2/CO/CH4/CO2/N-2) in the syngas composition and equivalence ratio as independent variables. The developed model was intended for low-calorific value syngas mixtures, and it performs exceedingly well without solving detailed governing equations, detailed chemistry, and transport equations. The proposed model is accurate for a wide range of syngas-air mixtures reported in the literature. A detailed comparison showed that the empirical model accurately predicts the laminar burning velocity with error <10%, for a wide range of H-2/CO/CH4/CO2/N-2/Air mixtures with 0.25 < X-H2 < 0.70, 0.25 < X-CO < 0.70, 0 < X-CH4 < 0.15, 0 < X-CO2 < 0.50, 0 < X-N2 < 0.70, for equivalence ratios of phi = 0.5-2.5, mixture temperatures from 300 to 650 K, and pressures from 1 to 5 atm.

In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed to predict tissue outcome in acute stroke patients using machine learning methods incorporating multiparametric imaging data. Most methods include diffusion and perfusion parameters as image-based parameters but do not include any spatial information although these parameters are spatially dependent, e.g. different perfusion properties in white and gray brain matter. This study aims to investigate if including spatial features improves the accuracy of multi-parametric tissue outcome prediction.
Materials and methods
Acute and follow-up multi-center MRI datasets of 99 patients were available for this study. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost machine learning models were trained and tested using acute MR diffusion and perfusion features and known follow-up lesions. Different combinations of atlas coordinates and lesion probability maps were included as spatial information. The stroke lesion predictions were compared to the true tissue outcomes using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the Dice metric.
Results
The statistical analysis revealed that including spatial features significantly improves the tissue outcome prediction. Overall, the XGBoost and random forest models performed best in every setting and achieved state-of-the-art results regarding both metrics with similar improvements achieved including Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space coordinates or voxel-wise lesion probabilities.
Conclusion
Spatial features should be integrated to improve lesion outcome prediction using machine learning models.","PERFUSION,PERFORMANCE,THRESHOLDS,DIFFUSION,TIME",Article,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE, 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,3.788,"PERFUSION,PERFORMANCE,THRESHOLDS,DIFFUSION,TIME",PLOS ONE,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6980585?pdf=render,

Methods The extracranial carotid arteries of 12 human subjects were imaged at 3 T using ungated QISS MRA. In 7 healthy volunteers, the effects of radial and Cartesian k-space sampling, single-shot and multishot image acquisition (1.1-3.3 seconds/slice, 141-423 seconds/volume), and deep learning-based image processing were evaluated using segmental image quality scoring, arterial temporal SNR, arterial-to-background contrast and apparent contrast-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. Comparison of deep learning-based image processing was made with block matching and 3D filtering denoising. Results Compared with Cartesian sampling, radial k-space sampling increased arterial temporal SNR 107% (P < .001) and improved image quality during 1-shot imaging (P < .05). The carotid arteries were depicted with similar image quality on the rapid 1-shot and much lengthier 3-shot radial QISS protocols (P = not significant), which was corroborated in patient studies. Deep learning-based image processing outperformed block matching and 3D filtering denoising in terms of structural similarity index (P < .001). Compared with original QISS source images, deep learning image processing provided 24% and 195% increases in arterial-to-background contrast (P < .001) and apparent contrast-to-noise ratio (P < .001), and provided source images that were preferred by radiologists (P < .001).

In this study, by using machine learning techniques, we developed deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly estimate the steady-state distributions of pressure and flow velocity inside the thoracic aorta. After training on hemodynamic data from CFD simulations, the DNNs take as input a shape of the aorta and directly output the hemodynamic distributions in one second. The trained DNNs are capable of predicting the velocity magnitude field with an average error of 1.9608% and the pressure field with an average error of 1.4269%.

In recent years, great efforts have been directed toward perfecting the design of a variety of supramolecular polymers and materials with different architectures. The resulting structures are often thought of as ideally perfect, defectfree supramolecular fibers, micelles, vesicles, etc., having an intrinsic dynamic character, which are typically studied at the level of statistical ensembles to assess their average properties. However, molecular simulations recently demonstrated that local defects that may be present or may form in these assemblies, and which are poorly captured by conventional approaches, are key to controlling their dynamic behavior and properties. The study of these defects poses considerable challenges, as the flexible/dynamic nature of these soft systems makes it difficult to identify what effectively constitutes a defect and to characterize its stability and evolution. Here, we demonstrate the power of unsupervised machine-learning techniques to systematically identify and compare defects in supramolecular polymer variants in different conditions, using as a benchmark 5 angstrom resolution coarse-grained molecular simulations of a family of supramolecular polymers. We show that this approach allows a complete data-driven characterization of the internal structure and dynamics of these complex assemblies and of the dynamic pathways for defects formation and resorption.

The proposed approximation method is able to describe the thermodynamic functions (Cp(T),S(T),H(T)-H(Tref),G(T)) of the different phases of unary material systems in a wide temperature range (between 0 and 6000 K). Phase transition temperatures and the respective enthalpies of transformation, which are computationally determined by the minimization of the Gibbs free energy, are also approximated. This is achieved by using artificial neural networks as models for the thermodynamic functions of the individual phases and by expressing the thermodynamic quantities in terms of the free network parameters. The resulting expressions are then optimized with machine learning algorithms on the basis of measurement data. A physical basis for the resulting approximation is given by the use of, among others, Planck-Einstein functions as activation function of the neurons of the network.

Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. Materials and Methods Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs).

The diagnosis is challenging to make accurately and quickly, relying on a combination of physical exam, history and radiologic evaluation. Failure to establish the diagnosis in a timely fashion can result in irreversible ovarian ischemia with implications for future fertility. Ultrasound is the mainstay of evaluation for ovarian torsion in the pediatric population. However, even with a high index of suspicion, imaging features are not pathognomonic. Objective We sought to develop an algorithm to aid radiologists in diagnosing ovarian torsion using machine learning from sonographic features and to evaluate the frequency of each sonographic element. Materials and methods All pediatric patients treated for ovarian torsion at a quaternary pediatric hospital over an 11-year period were identified by both an internal radiology database and hospital-based International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code review. Inclusion criteria were surgical confirmation of ovarian torsion and available imaging. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis could not be confirmed, no imaging was available for review, the ovary was not identified by imaging, or torsion involved other adnexal structures but spared the ovary. Data collection included: patient age; laterality of torsion; bilateral ovarian volumes; torsed ovarian position, i.e. whether medialized with respect to the mid-uterine line; presence or absence of Doppler signal within the torsed ovary; visualization of peripheral follicles; and presence of a mass or cyst, and free peritoneal fluid. Subsequently, we evaluated a non-torsed control cohort from April 2015 to May 2016. This cohort consisted of sequential girls and young adults presenting to the emergency department with abdominopelvic symptoms concerning for ovarian torsion but who were ultimately diagnosed otherwise. These features were then fed into supervised machine learning systems to identify and develop viable decision algorithms. We divided data into training and validation sets and assessed algorithm performance using sub-sets of the validation set. Results We identified 119 torsion-confirmed cases and 331 torsion-absent cases. Of the torsion-confirmed cases, significant imaging differences were evident for girls younger than 1 year; these girls were then excluded from analysis, and 99 pediatric patients older than 1 year were included in our study. Among these 99, all variables demonstrated statistically significant differences between the torsion-confirmed and torsion-absent groups with P-values <0.005. Using any single variable to identify torsion provided only modest detection performance, with areas under the curve (AUC) for medialization, peripheral follicles, and absence of Doppler flow of 0.76 +/- 0.16, 0.66 +/- 0.14 and 0.82 +/- 0.14, respectively. The best decision tree using a combination of variables yielded an AUC of 0.96 +/- 0.07 and required knowledge of the presence of intra-ovarian flow, peripheral follicles, the volume of both ovaries, and the presence of cysts or masses. Conclusion Based on the largest series of pediatric ovarian torsion in the literature to date, we quantified sonographic features and used machine learning to create an algorithm to identify the presence of ovarian torsion - an algorithm that performs better than simple approaches relying on single features.
Although complex combinations using multiple-interaction models provide slightly better performance, a clinically pragmatic decision tree can be employed to detect torsion, providing sensitivity levels of 95 +/- 14% and specificity of 92 +/- 2%.","Algorithm,Children,Machine learning,Medialization,Ovary,Torsion,Ultrasound",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Pediatrics,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.355,"ADNEXAL,TORSION,SONOGRAPHIC,FINDINGS,DOPPLER,SONOGRAPHY,SPECTRUM",PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY,,

While manual segmentation is time-consuming and operator-dependent, current computer-assisted segmentation methods are facing challenges posed by varying shapes and sizes.

Methods The proposed MsFF is built upon the well-recognized encoder-decoder framework. Firstly, in the encoder stage, the squeeze-and-excitation module is incorporated to enhance the learning of features by exploiting channel-wise independence. Secondly, a hierarchical fusion module is introduced to better utilize both low-level and high-level features to retain boundary information and make final predictions.

This is the first time this method has been used in an archaeological setting. The results show that these bones were mostly broken by anthropic action, while some were slightly ravaged by carnivores, probably hyaenas.

Although the aerospace composite structures possess numerous advantages, invisible internal structural damage such as delaminations induced by various external factors can significantly reduce the mechanical affordability, safety, and life-cycle of the structure. Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor and assess the health state and predict accurately the lifetime of aerospace composite structures. An acousto-ultrasonics-based multi-damage index identification approach is thus proposed in this study to identify and quantify possible multiple damage in thin-walled aerospace composite structures. In this approach, two indices for damage quantification were proposed: the energy and phase divergence indices. The energy index defines the reflected energy resulting from damage, and the phase divergence index defines the instantaneous phase variation of propagating waves due to damage. The two damage indices are obtained through the developed mode decomposition and spectral element analysis using sensor response signals collected by a transducer array placed onto the examined structure. Through a series of relevant experimental tests on the fabricated laminated composite panels with/without damage, the proposed acousto-ultrasonics-based multi-damage index identification approach was validated. The developed damage indices are competent to evaluate a structural health state in terms of damage quantification, and all of the validation results fell well in the prospected ranges. Moreover, it shows a linear and consistent trend between the variation of two damage indices and damage extents. Based on the particular relation, the linear regressive prediction functions were established separately regarding the two damage indices. They can be used to assess a structural health state due to the damage growth in real time. The proposed multi-damage index identification approach demonstrates its potential to serve as an online assessment tool to be aware of the reliability condition of a composite structure.","Multi-damage identification,transducers array,spectral element analysis,damage index,carbon fiber-laminated composites",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation",,5.861,"MACHINE-LEARNING,APPROACH,PLATES,DELAMINATION,PROBABILITY,TRANSFORM,IMPACT",STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,,

The existence of susceptible plaque in the carotid artery can be used in ascertaining the possibilities of cardiovascular diseases and long-term disabilities. The imaging modality used for early screening of the disease is B-mode ultrasound image of the person in the artery area. The objective of this article is to give a widespread review of the imaging modes and methods used for studying the carotid artery for identifying stroke, atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases. We encompass the review in methods used for artery wall tracking, intima-media, and lumen segmentation which will help in finding the extent of the disease. Due to the characteristics of the imaging modality used, the images have speckle noise which worsens the image quality. Adaptive homomorphic filtering with wavelet and contourlet transforms, Levy Shrink, gamma distribution were used for image denoising. Learning-based neural network approaches for denoising give better edge preservation. Domain knowledge-based segmentation approaches have proved to provide more accurate intima-media thickness measurements. There is a requirement of useful fully automatic segmentation approaches, 3D, 4D systems, and plaque motion analysis. Taking into consideration the image priors like geometry, imaging physics, intensity and temporal data, image analysis has to be performed. Encouragingly more research has focused on content-specific segmentation and classification techniques. With the evaluation of machine learning algorithms, classifying the image as with or without a fat deposit has gained better accuracy and sensitivity. Machine learning-based approaches like self-organizing map, k-nearest neighborhood and support vector machine achieve promising accuracy and sensitivity in classification.

To further explain the variability of the classifier type, four different classifier algorithms were selected for solving this problem. In the hypertension dataset, there are eight features including sex, age, height (cm), weight (kg), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (bpm), and BMI (kg/m(2)) to explain the hypertension status and then there are four classes comprising the normal (healthy), prehypertension, stage-1 hypertension, and stage-2 hypertension.

In this paper, we propose a new entropy-based pattern learning by a combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and entropy measures for assessment of physiological signals. Physiological signals are first represented as a series of SSA components, and then well-established entropy measures are extracted from the resulting SSA components that can help to facilitate the features extraction from physiological signals. The entropy measures of notable SSA components are used to form input features and fed into pattern classifier. To demonstrate its validity, applicability, and versatility, the proposed entropy-based pattern learning is used to perform medical assessments with three kinds of classical physiological signals, that is, electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and RR-interval signals. Experiments demonstrate that in all cases, the proposed entropy-based pattern learning can effectively capture specific biosignal patterns of physiological signals and achieve excellent identification performances for the assessments of EEG, EMG, and RR-interval signals. Besides, through the comparison of the identification performances for entropy-based pattern learning based on the physiological signals themselves and the SSA components, it is concluded that the discriminating power of entropy-based pattern learning based on the SSA components is much stronger than that based on the physiological signals themselves. Since it can be easily extended to any other physiological signal analysis, the proposed entropy-based pattern learning may use as an efficient approach to reveal biosignal patterns for medical assessment of physiological signals.","APPROXIMATE ENTROPY,WAVELET TRANSFORM,NEURAL-NETWORK,EEG,SCHIZOPHRENIA,IDENTIFICATION",Article,"WILEY-HINDAWI, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND","Mathematics,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,2.8,"APPROXIMATE,ENTROPY,WAVELET,TRANSFORM,NEURAL-NETWORK,EEG,SCHIZOPHRENIA,IDENTIFICATION",COMPLEXITY,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4625218.pdf,

Many algorithms have been designed to optimize beam orientation selection because of its impact on treatment plan quality, but these algorithms suffer from slow calculation of the dose influence matrices of all candidate beams. We propose a fast beam orientation selection method, based on deep learning neural networks (DNN), capable of developing a plan comparable to those developed by the state-of-the-art column generation (CG) method. Our model's novelty lies in its supervised learning structure (using CG to teach the network), DNN architecture, and ability to learn from anatomical features to predict dosimetrically suitable beam orientations without using dosimetric information from the candidate beams. This may save hours of computation. Methods A supervised DNN is trained to mimic the CG algorithm, which iteratively chooses beam orientations one-by-one by calculating beam fitness values based on Karush-Kush-Tucker optimality conditions at each iteration. The DNN learns to predict these values. The dataset contains 70 prostate cancer patients - 50 training, 7 validation, and 13 test patients - to develop and test the model. Each patient's data contains 6 contours: PTV, body, bladder, rectum, and left and right femoral heads. Column generation was implemented with a GPU-based Chambolle-Pock algorithm, a first-order primal-dual proximal-class algorithm, to create 6270 plans. The DNN trained over 400 epochs, each with 2500 steps and a batch size of 1, using the Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 x 10(-5) and a sixfold cross-validation technique. Results The average and standard deviation of training, validation, and testing loss functions among the six folds were 0.62 +/- 0.09%, 1.04 +/- 0.06%, and 1.44 +/- 0.11%, respectively. Using CG and supervised DNN, we generated two sets of plans for each scenario in the test set. The proposed method took at most 1.5 s to select a set of five beam orientations and 300 s to calculate the dose influence matrices for 5 beams and finally 20 s to solve the fluence map optimization (FMO). However, CG needed around 15 h to calculate the dose influence matrices of all beams and at least 400 s to solve both the beam orientation selection and FMO problems. The differences in the dose coverage of PTV between plans generated by CG and by DNN were 0.2%. The average dose differences received by organs at risk were between 1 and 6 percent: Bladder had the smallest average difference in dose received (0.956 +/- 1.184%), then Rectum (2.44 +/- 2.11%), Left Femoral Head (6.03 +/- 5.86%), and Right Femoral Head (5.885 +/- 5.515%). The dose received by Body had an average difference of 0.10 +/- 0.1% between the generated treatment plans. Conclusions We developed a fast beam orientation selection method based on a DNN that selects beam orientations in seconds and is therefore suitable for clinical routines. In the training phase of the proposed method, the model learns the suitable beam orientations based on patients' anatomical features and omits time intensive calculations of dose influence matrices for all possible candidate beams.
Solving the FMO to get the final treatment plan requires calculating dose influence matrices only for the selected beams.","beam orientation optimization,column generation,deep neural network,intensity-modulated radiation therapy,prostate cancer",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"LOCAL,SEARCH,ALGORITHMS,CONFORMAL,RADIOTHERAPY,ANGLE,SELECTION,IMRT,GENERATION,VMAT,COPLANAR",MEDICAL PHYSICS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849631,

PsP exhibits similarities in shape and intensity to the true tumor progression (TTP) of GBM on the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These similarities pose challenges to the differentiation of these types of progression and hence the selection of the appropriate clinical treatment strategy. Methods To address this challenge, we introduced a novel feature learning method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and AlexNet, termed DC-AL GAN, to discriminate between PsP and TTP in MRI images. Due to the adversarial relationship between the generator and the discriminator of DCGAN, high-level discriminative features of PsP and TTP can be derived for the discriminator with AlexNet. We also constructed a multifeature selection module to concatenate features from different layers, contributing to more powerful features used for effectively discriminating between PsP and TTP. Finally, these discriminative features from the discriminator are used for classification by a support vector machine (SVM). Tenfold cross-validation (CV) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) were applied to evaluate the performance of this developed algorithm. Results The accuracy and AUC of DC-AL GAN for discriminating PsP and TTP after tenfold CV were 0.920 and 0.947. We also assessed the effects of different indicators (such as sensitivity and specificity) for features extracted from different layers to obtain a model with the best classification performance. Conclusions The proposed model DC-AL GAN is capable of learning discriminative representations from GBM datasets, and it achieves desirable PsP and TTP classification performance superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, the developed model would be useful in the diagnosis of PsP and TTP for GBM.","deep convolutional generative adversarial network,glioblastoma multiforme,multifeature selection module,pseudoprogression,unsupervised representation learning",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,3.767,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,TEMOZOLOMIDE,COMBINATION,NECROSIS,THERAPY",MEDICAL PHYSICS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06085,

Traditional invasive hemoglobin (Hb) detection led to delayed diagnosis, operational inefficiency, incorrect critical decision making, and uncomfortable patient experience. To facilitate real-time total hemoglobin (tHb) monitoring, a portable prototype of a noninvasive Hb detection system was developed, and the accuracy of Hb predicted based on partial least squares (PLS) as well as backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) models was validated. Results. The prototype was combined with a signal processing circuit and a spectrophotometric probe containing 8 wavelength LEDs light source and photodiode array. Laboratory invasive Hb (Lab_tHb) and spot check Hb measurements with PLS (SpHb_PLS) and BP (SpHb_BP) methods were obtained simultaneously by hematology analyzer and the designed system. The invasive and noninvasive estimates of the Hb levels were analyzed using Spearman correlation as well as Bland-Altman plot and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. A total of 238 volunteers had attempted laboratory invasive and noninvasive spot check Hb measurements. Mean Lab_tHb, SpHb_PLS, and SpHb_BP were 13.6 +/- 1.80 g/dL, 13.5 +/- 1.07 g/dL, and 13.6 +/- 1.06 g/dL, respectively. Noninvasive SpHb_PLS (r = 0.61, p<0.001) and SpHb_BP (r = 0.62, p<0.001) had a strong correlation with invasive tHb values. The Bland-Altman plot showed excellent consistency between the proposed noninvasive methods and laboratory invasive reference. In ROC analysis, PLS and BP models were good at predicting Hb >= 12 g/dL with area under the curve of 0.828 and 0.824, respectively. Observed differences between invasive and noninvasive Hb measurements displayed no significant correlation with perfusion index values. Conclusions. The result confirmed that noninvasive Hb monitoring had an excellent correlation with traditional invasive Hb measurement. Furthermore, it is suggested that the developed prototype has the potential for the noninvasive detection of Hb concentration with the methods of PLS and BP-ANN.","PULSE CO-OXIMETRY,LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION,ACCURACY,PREDICTION,COMPONENT,SIGNALS",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,,"PULSE,CO-OXIMETRY,LEAST-SQUARES,REGRESSION,ACCURACY,PREDICTION,COMPONENT,SIGNALS",JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jece/2020/3034260.pdf,

Materials and methods Simulations and in vivo Na-23 MRI examinations of calf muscle were performed with a nominal spatial resolution of Delta x = (3.0 x 3.0 x 15.0) mm(3). Fully sampled and three undersampled Na-23 MRI data sets (undersampling factors (USF) = 3, 4.4, 6.7) were evaluated. Ten healthy subjects were examined on a 3 Tesla MRI system. Results of the simulation study and the in vivo measurements were compared to the ground truth (GT) and the fully sampled fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) reconstruction, respectively.
Results Reconstruction results of simulated data with optimized 3D-DLCS yielded a lower deviation (<4%) from the GT than results of the NUFFT reconstruction (>5%) and a lower standard deviation (SD). For in vivo measurements, a TSC of 17 +/- 2.7 mMol/l was observed. The mean deviation from the reference is lower for the undersampled 3D-DLCS reconstructions (3.4%) than for NUFFT reconstructions (4.6%). SD is reduced using 3D-DLCS. Compared to a fully sampled NUFFT reconstruction, acquisition time could be reduced by a factor of 4.4 while maintaining similar quantitative accuracy.

To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner.
This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In machine learning, nonlinear projection into a high-dimensional feature space can make data linearly separable(3,4), simplifying the classification of complex features. Such nonlinear projections are computationally expensive in conventional computers. A promising approach is to exploit physical materials systems that perform this nonlinear projection intrinsically, because of their high computational density(5), inherent parallelism and energy efficiency(6,7). However, existing approaches either rely on the systems' time dynamics, which requires sequential data processing and therefore hinders parallel computation(5,6,8), or employ large materials systems that are difficult to scale up(7). Here we use a parallel, nanoscale approach inspired by filters in the brain(1) and artificial neural networks(2) to perform nonlinear classification and feature extraction. We exploit the nonlinearity of hopping conduction(9-11) through an electrically tunable network of boron dopant atoms in silicon, reconfiguring the network through artificial evolution to realize different computational functions. We first solve the canonical two-input binary classification problem, realizing all Boolean logic gates(12) up to room temperature, demonstrating nonlinear classification with the nanomaterial system. We then evolve our dopant network to realize feature filters(2) that can perform four-input binary classification on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digit database. Implementation of our material-based filters substantially improves the classification accuracy over that of a linear classifier directly applied to the original data(13).

The domain expert knowledge is quantified by means of weighted scoring and integrated into the selection process to eliminate the risk of crucial features being removed. The test studies on ten material properties datasets demonstrate the potential of the approach to automatically search for a reduced feature set with lower root mean square errors than those for the initial feature set. Essentially, the most relevant material features, the number of which is much smaller than that in the original feature set, are automatically selected to establish a closer and more accurate structure-activity relationship for the materials of interest.

Using airborne imagery over a large-scale area for fast retrieval is of great importance for environmental monitoring and further decision support.

In this study, we utilized the airborne hyperspectral data in LiuXin Mine of China obtained from HySpex VNIR-1600 and HySpex SWIR-384 sensor to establish the spectral-analysis-based model for retrieval of heavy metals concentration. Firstly, sixty soil samples were collected in situ, and their heavy metal concentrations (Cr, Cu, Pb) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis. Due to mixed pixels widespread in airborne hyperspectral images, spectral unmixing was conducted to obtain purer spectra of the soil and to improve the estimation accuracy. Ten of estimated models, including four different random forest models (RF)-standard random forest (SRF), regularized random forest (RRF), guided random forest (GRF), and guided regularized random forest (GRRF)-were introduced for hyperspectral estimated model in this paper. Compared with the estimation results, the best accuracy for Cr, Cu, and Pb is obtained by RF. It shows that RF can predict the three heavy metals better than other models in this area.

To date, numerous red blood cell (RBC) indices have been investigated and various parameters have been proposed for each index. In the present study, a differential diagnosis of IDA and beta-thalassemia was performed by using RBC indices and machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The RBC indices were used as input parameters for the classifier and the performances of SVM and KNN were evaluated separately, in order to determine the effectivity of both techniques. Fewer parameters were given as an inputs to machine learning algorithms, and higher performance was achieved. On the other hand, a feature selection technique, the Neighborhood Component Analysis Feature Selection (NCA) algorithm, was used for selecting features from the datasets, and the parameters selected via NCA provided high performance (97% Area Under the ROC curve [AUC]. Taken together, the results indicated that the RBC indices used in the study showed higher performance compared to those reported in the literature. By using these indices, not only the individual effect of each index parameter on the machine learning model was investigated but also a different subset of features from those employed in the literature was established. In addition, as distinct from the literature, the study revealed that different CBC parameters were efficient in distinguishing between IDA and beta-thalassemia in male and female patients.

The maximum bio-oil yield is then computed using the optimum values of the parameters. The CFD simulation is also performed using the optimum parameters obtained by the SVR-PSO. The CFD results and the values predicted by the MLA for the product yields are finally compared where a good agreement is achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

93,Seizures Identification from EEG Signals Based on Functional Brain Network and TSK Fuzzy System,56,2,133-140,",,,","Du Qing,Xin Shouting,Lei Xinyu,Yu Haitao",,,Du Qing,"Identifying seizures from EEG signals is a crucial tool in clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. However, the accuracy of manually labeling EEG signals is barely satisfactory. In this paper, a method based on functional brain network and TSK fuzzy system is proposed to identify seizures from EEG signals. Functional brain networks of epileptics are constructed by analyzing the synchronization between multi-channel EEG signals. Complex network theory is further applied to extract topological features of brain networks. Taken the network parameters as independent inputs, a fuzzy system based TSK model is established and further trained through supervised learning to identify seizures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of seizure states identification are 98.36%, 99.48%, and 97.24%, respectively. The novel method, combining complex network theory with machine learning algorithm, provides a potential tool for identifying epilepsy state from EEG signals, which has important values in clinical application.","EEG; complex network; fuzzy system; ,machine learning",Article,,,,,,,,

Confidence in the decision support, however, must be achieved by establishing uncertainty bounds in ICME model chains. The quantification and propagation of uncertainty in computational materials science, however, remains a rather unexplored aspect of computational materials science approaches. Moreover, traditional uncertainty propagation frameworks tend to be limited in cases with computationally expensive simulations. A rather common and important model chain is that of CALPHAD-based thermodynamic models of phase stability coupled to phase-field models for microstructure evolution. Propagation of uncertainty in these cases is challenging not only due to the sheer computational cost of the simulations but also because of the high dimensionality of the input space. In this work, we present a framework for the quantification and propagation of uncertainty in a CALPHAD-based elastochemical phase-field model. We motivate our work by investigating the microstructure evolution in Mg2SixSn1-x thermoelectric materials. We first carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based inference of the CALPHAD model parameters for this pseudobinary system and then use advanced sampling schemes to propagate uncertainties across a high-dimensional simulation input space. Through high-throughput phase-field simulations we generate 200,000 time series of synthetic microstructures and use machine learning approaches to understand the effects of propagated uncertainties on the microstructure landscape of the system under study.

However, phase equilibrium calculations, including stability tests and phase splitting calculations, may require huge computational costs. An improved artificial neural network model is developed based on our previous work to achieve the prediction of phase stability with high accuracy and reduce the computational costs in order of magnitude. This model does not directly tell if a hydrocarbon mixture at given compositions, pressure and temperature is stable or unstable, and it is able to predict the saturation pressures. By comparing the given pressure with the predicted saturation pressure, it is natural to tell the stability of a hydrocarbon mixture. For the phase splitting calculations, another artificial neural network model is developed to provide more reliable initial guesses for commonly used equilibrium methods to reduce their nonlinear iterations. Compared with our previous work, multi-layer neural networks are employed in the models. The improved models have more efficient training processes and more accurate prediction results. Additionally, an adaptive data generation process is introduced to optimize the quality and size of training data; the data transformation and normalization are discussed to reduce the skewness of the data and rescale the data; and a model training and selection strategy is also discussed to efficiently train a high-quality model. The efficiency of the ANN models is first validated by standalone phase equilibrium calculations with a three-component hydrocarbon mixture. Then the ANN models are successfully applied in compositional simulation examples, which demonstrates the practical value of these ANN models on speeding up the phase equilibrium calculations during compositional simulations.

The coal ash deformation temperature (DT) is determined by its chemical composition, but relationship between the two remains uncertain. In this paper, the traditional linear regression, Factsage calculation, and back-propagation (BP) neural network calculation are used to predict the coal ash deformation temperature. The results show that the melting characteristic temperature of coal ash has a great relationship with the coal ash composition. The linear regression can predict the change trend of coal ash deformation temperature, but the prediction results are not very satisfactory. The calculation results of Factsage show a great deviation from the experimental values. The prediction results of the BP neural network can achieve good accuracy, and the maximum relative average error of prediction results is 6.67%. This also illustrates the feasibility of using the BP network prediction model in predicting coal ash deformation temperature.","Melting characteristic temperature,Blast furnace injection,Deformation temperature,Linear regression,Factsage,BP neural network",Article,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","Energy & Fuels,Engineering",,6.63,"PETROLEUM,COKE,FUSION,GASIFICATION,CHAR",FUEL,,

After the initial result of liver image segmentation is obtained,the boundaries of the initial result is corrected by using blocks formed by the watershed algorithm, so as to obtain a segmentation result with smooth and precise boundaries.

The deep learning network seems like an effective solution,but it lacks sufficient medical data for training. To address this problem,this paper proposes a Progressive Fine-Tuning( PFT) strategy,and applies this strategy to the deep transfer learning network for the auxiliary diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. First,the neural network is used to learn feature knowledge in the large dataset of coarse-grained natural images. Then,the learnt feature information is transferred to the small dataset of the fine-grained pulmonary nodule through the reconstructed network classification layer. From the full-connected classification layer to the convolutional layer,the PFT strategy is adopted to release and fine-tune the layers one by one. Finally,the optimal fine-tuning depth is determined according to the quantitative analysis of AUC values of each layer after fine-tuning. Besides,the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping ( Grad-CAM) and t-SNE algorithm are used to provide corresponding visual support and interpretation for network prediction results.

Recognizing the requirement that the amount of sound data collected from each person should be as small as possible, this work studies data augmentation (DA) techniques that avoid the system training process from the overfitting problem when the training sound data is insufficient.
