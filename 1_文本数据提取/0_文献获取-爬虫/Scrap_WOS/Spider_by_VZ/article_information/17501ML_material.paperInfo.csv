1,Arterial Spin Labeling Images Synthesis From sMRI Using Unbalanced Deep Discriminant Learning,38,10,2338-2351,"Huang Wei,Luo Mingyuan,Liu Xi,Zhang Peng,Ding Huijun,Xue Wufeng,Ni Dong","Huang W,Luo MY,Liu X,Zhang P,Ding HJ,Xue WF,Ni D",Ni D,10.1109/TMI.2019.2906677,Shenzhen University,"Adequate medical images are often indispensable in contemporary deep learning-based medical imaging studies, although the acquisition of certain image modalities may be limited due to several issues including high costs and patients issues. However, thanks to recent advances in deep learning techniques, the above tough problem can be substantially alleviated by medical images synthesis, by which various modalities including T1/T2/DTI MRI images, PET images, cardiac ultrasound images, retinal images, and so on, have already been synthesized. Unfortunately, the arterial spin labeling (ASL) image, which is an important fMRI indicator in dementia diseases diagnosis nowadays, has never been comprehensively investigated for the synthesis purpose yet. In this paper, ASL images have been successfully synthesized from structural magnetic resonance images for the first time. Technically, a novel unbalanced deep discriminant learning-based model equipped with new ResNet sub-structures is proposed to realize the synthesis of ASL images from structural magnetic resonance images. The extensive experiments have been conducted. Comprehensive statistical analyses reveal that: 1) this newly introduced model is capable to synthesize ASL images that are similar towards real ones acquired by actual scanning; 2) synthesized ASL images obtained by the new model have demonstrated outstanding performance when undergoing rigorous tests of region-based and voxel-based corrections of partial volume effects, which are essential in ASL images processing; and 3) it is also promising that the diagnosis performance of dementia diseases can be significantly improved with the help of synthesized ASL images obtained by the new model, based on a multi-modal MRI dataset containing 355 demented patients in this paper.","Deep learning,Dementia,Biomedical imaging,Medical diagnosis,Magnetic resonance imaging,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),brain,machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY,ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE,CLASSIFICATION,GENERATION,PREDICTION,SEQUENCES,TIME",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,,
2,Latent Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis With Incomplete Multi-Modality Neuroimaging and Genetic Data,38,10,2411-2422,"Zhou Tao,Liu Mingxia,Thung Kim-Han,Shen Dinggang","Zhou T,Liu MX,Thung KH,Shen DG",Shen DG,10.1109/TMI.2019.2913158,University of North Carolina,"The fusion of complementary information contained in multi-modality data [e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and genetic data] has advanced the progress of automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. However, multi-modality based AD diagnostic models are often hindered by the missing data, i.e., not all the subjects have complete multi-modality data. One simple solution used by many previous studies is to discard samples with missing modalities. However, this significantly reduces the number of training samples, thus leading to a sub-optimal classification model. Furthermore, when building the classification model, most existing methods simply concatenate features from different modalities into a single feature vector without considering their underlying associations. As features from different modalities are often closely related (e.g., MRI and PET features are extracted from the same brain region), utilizing their inter-modality associations may improve the robustness of the diagnostic model. To this end, we propose a novel latent representation learning method for multi-modality based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we use all the available samples (including samples with incomplete modality data) to learn a latent representation space. Within this space, we not only use samples with complete multi-modality data to learn a common latent representation, but also use samples with incomplete multi-modality data to learn independent modality-specific latent representations. We then project the latent representations to the label space for AD diagnosis. We perform experiments using 737 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Feature extraction,Genetics,Neuroimaging,Alzheimer's disease,Positron emission tomography,Alzheimer's disease,multi-modality data,incomplete multi-modality data,latent representation space",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Computer Science,Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,10.332,"MILD,COGNITIVE,IMPAIRMENT,CANONICAL,CORRELATION-ANALYSIS,FEATURE-SELECTION,CLASSIFICATION,MRI,SEGMENTATION,FEATURES,PREDICT,FUSION",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034601,

This serious mental disorder exposes people to stigmatization, discrimination, and violation of their human rights. Different works on classification and diagnosis of mental illnesses use electroencephalogram signals (EEG) because it reflects brain functioning, and how these diseases affect it. Due to the information provided by the EEG signals and the performance demonstrated by Deep Learning algorithms, the present work proposes a model for the classification of schizophrenic and healthy people through EEG signals using Deep Learning methods.

Optimal Latin hypercube sampling and virtual simulation experiments were conducted using the commercial DEM software; the microscopic variables included the static friction coefficient between the particles, collision recovery coefficient, Johnson-Kendall-Roberts surface energy, static friction coefficient between the particles and wall, and collision recovery coefficient. A predictive model based on genetic-algorithm-optimized feedforward neural network (back propagation) was developed to calibrate the microscopic DEM simulation parameters.

However, most of the existing methods directly downscale the multispectral (MSI) and panchromatic (PAN) images with default blur kernel to construct the training set, which will lead to the deteriorative results when the real image does not obey this degradation. In this paper, a deep self-learning (DSL) network is proposed for adaptive image pansharpening. First, rather than using the fixed blur kernel, a point spread function (PSF) estimation algorithm is proposed to obtain the blur kernel of the MSI. Second, an edge-detection-based pixel-to-pixel image registration method is designed to recover the local misalignments between MSI and PAN. Third, the original data is downscaled by the estimated PSF and the pansharpening network is trained in the down-sampled domain. The high-resolution result can be finally predicted by the trained DSL network using the original MSI and PAN.

A survey of the tolerance factor over 130 garnet-type compounds reveals that the data points are scattered in a narrow range. The tolerance factor is helpful in understanding the crystal chemistry of some garnet-type compounds and could serve as a guide for predicting the stability of the garnet phase.

The research works that explore objective quantification of bradykinesia are mostly based on highly-integrated sensors. Although these sensor-based methods demonstrate applaudable performance, it is unrealistic to promote them for wide use because the special devices they require are far from popularized in daily lives. In this paper, we take advantage of computer vision and machine learning technologies, proposing a vision-based method to automatically and objectively quantify bradykinesia severity. Three bradykinesia-related items are investigated in our study: finger tapping, hand clasping and hand pro/supination. In our method, human pose estimation technology is utilized to extract kinematic characteristics and supervised-learning-based classifiers are employed to generate score ratings. Clinical experiment on 60 patients shows that the scoring accuracy of our method over 360 examination videos is 89.7%, which is competitive with other related works. The devices our method requires are only a camera for instrumentation and a laptop for data processing.

By analyzing the encephalogram (EEG) signals of patients with epilepsy, their conditions can be monitored and seizure can be detected and intervened in time. As the identification of effective features in EEG signals is important for accurate seizure detection, this paper proposes a multi-view deep feature extraction method in attempt to achieve this goal. The method first uses fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to construct the initial multi-view features. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to automatically learn deep features from the initial multi-view features, which reduces the dimensionality and obtain the features with better seizure identification ability. Furthermore, the multi-view Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (MV-TSK-FS), an interpretable rule-based classifier, is used to construct a classification model with strong generalizability based on the deep multi-view features obtained. Experimental studies show that the classification accuracy of the proposed multi-view deep feature extraction method is at least 1% higher than that of common feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), FFT and WPD.

In clinical practice, different acupuncture manipulations are required to achieve different therapeutic effects, which means it is crucial to distinguish different acupuncture manipulations. In this paper, we proposed a classification framework for different acupuncture manipulations, which employed the graph theory and machine learning method. Multichannel EEG signals evoked by acupuncture at ""Zusanli"" acupoint were recorded from healthy humans by two acupuncture manipulations: twirling-rotating (TR) and lifting-thrusting (LT). Phase locking value was used to estimate the phase synchronization of pair-wise EEG channels. It was found that acupunctured by TR manipulation exhibit significantly higher synchronization degree than acupunctured by LT manipulation. With the construction of functional brain network, the topological features of graph theory were extracted. Taken the network features as inputs, machine learning classifiers were established to classify acupuncture manipulations. The highest accuracy can achieve 92.14% with support vector machine. By further optimizing the network features utilized in machine learning classifiers, it was found that the combination of node betweenness and small world network index is the most effective factor for acupuncture manipulations classification. These findings suggested that our approach provides new ideas for automatically identify acupuncture manipulations from the perspective of functional brain networks and machine learning methods.","Acupuncture manipulation,EEG,functional brain network,graph theory,machine learning",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Rehabilitation",,4.735,"SUPPORT,VECTOR,MACHINES,SYNCHRONIZATION,LIKELIHOOD,HEALTHY-SUBJECTS,FMRI,DATA,CONNECTIVITY,STIMULATION,SPECIFICITY,PATTERNS,SEIZURES,ST36",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,,

Localizing the active layers of somatosensory cortex (spatial analysis) and investigating the dynamics of recorded seizures (temporal analysis) are the main goals of this research. Approach: We model the spike discharges of seizures using a generative spatio-temporal model. We assume that there are some states under first-order Markovian model during seizures, and each spike is generated when the corresponding state is activated. We also assume that a few specific epileptic activities (or atoms) exist in each state which are linearly combined and form the spikes. Each epileptic activity is described by two characteristics: (1) its spatial topography which shows the organization of current sources and sinks generating the epileptic activity, and (2) its temporal representation which illustrates the activation function of the epileptic activity. We show that the estimation of the model parameters, i.e. states and their epileptic activities (atoms), is similar to solving a dictionary learning problem for sparse representation. Instead of using classical dictionary learning algorithms, a new approach, taking into account the Markovian nature of the model, is proposed for estimating the models parameters, and its efficiency is experimentally verified. Main results: Experimental results show that there are one dominant and one unstable state with two epileptic activities in each during the seizures (temporal analysis). It is also found that the top and bottom layers of the somatosensory cortex are the most active layers during seizures (spatial analysis). The structural model is similar for all rats with a spatial topography which is the same for all rats but a temporal activation which changes according to the rat. Significance: The proposed framework can be applied on any database acquired from a small area of the brain, and can provide valuable spatio-temporal analysis for neuroscientists.","seizure,spatio-temporal analysis,spike,state,epileptic activity",Article,"IOP PUBLISHING LTD, TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","Biophysics,Engineering,Physiology",,,"EPILEPSY,MODEL,RAT",PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT,,

Abstract Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been intensely studied as a possible solution in the fields of analytical chemistry and biosensorics for decades. Substantial research has been devoted to engineering signal enhanced SERS-active substrates based on semi-continuous nanostructured silver and gold films, or agglomerates of micro- and nanoparticles in solution. Herein, we demonstrate the high-amplitude spectra of myoglobin precipitated out of ultra-low concentration solutions (below 10 mu g/mL) using e-beam evaporated continuous self-assembled silver films. We observe up to 10(5) times Raman signal amplification with purposefully designed SERS-active substrates in comparison with the control samples. SERS-active substrates are obtained by electron beam evaporation of silver thin films with well controlled nanostructured surface morphology. The characteristic dimensions of the morphology elements vary in the range from several to tens of nanometers. Using optical confocal microscopy we demonstrate that proteins form a conformation on the surface of the self-assembled silver film, which results in an effective enhancement of giant Raman scattering signal. We investigate the various SERS substrates surface morphologies by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in combination with deep data analysis with Gwyddion software and a number of machine learning techniques. Based on these results, we identify the most significant film surface morphology patterns and evaporation recipe parameters to obtain the highest amplitude SERS spectra. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility of automated selection of suitable morphological parameters to obtain the high-amplitude spectra. The developed AFM data auto-analysis procedures are used for smart optimization of SERS-active substrates nanoengineering processes.","SERS substrate,metal film,myoglobin,neural networks,e-beam evaporation",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"ENHANCED,RAMAN-SCATTERING,ACUTE,MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,SURFACE,NANOSTRUCTURES,NANOPARTICLES,DIAGNOSIS,SINGLE",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/3988/pdf,

Research exhibits significant advancements and demonstrates that common video cameras correspond to reliable devices that can be employed to measure a large set of biomedical parameters without any contact with the subject. A new framework for measuring and mapping pulse rate from video is presented in this pilot study. The method, which relies on convolutional 3D networks, is fully automatic and does not require any special image preprocessing. In addition, the network ensures concurrent mapping by producing a prediction for each local group of pixels. A particular training procedure that employs only synthetic data is proposed. Preliminary results demonstrate that this convolutional 3D network can effectively extract pulse rate from video without the need for any processing of frames. The trained model was compared with other state-of-the-art methods on public data. Results exhibit significant agreement between estimated and ground-truth measurements: the root mean square error computed from pulse rate values assessed with the convolutional 3D network is equal to 8.64 bpm, which is superior to 10 bpm for the other state-of-the-art methods. The robustness of the method to natural motion and increases in performance correspond to the two main avenues that will be considered in future works.","remote photoplethysmography,convolutional neural networks,pulse rate",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"HEART-RATE,LEARNING,APPROACH,NONCONTACT,VARIABILITY",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/20/4364/pdf,

In order to improve the identification accuracy, a novel wavelet decomposition and Back Propagation (BP) neural networks with the peak-to-peak amplitude and the kurtosis index were proposed to identify the expulsion from electrode force sensing signals. The rapid step impulse and resultant damping vibration of electrode force was determined as a robust indication of expulsion, and this feature was extracted from the electrode force waveform by seven-layer wavelet decomposition with Daubechies5 wavelets. Then, the energy distribution proportion of the decomposed detail signals were calculated, and the highest-energy one was selected as the target signal. Two statistical indexes were introduced in this paper to measure the target signal in overall situation and volatility. The bigger the peak-to-peak amplitude is, the more violent the fluctuation is. Moreover, the higher the kurtosis index is, the stronger the impact is, and the lower the dispersion degree of the data is. Experimental analysis showed that neither the peak-to-peak amplitude nor the kurtosis index could accurately judge the expulsion defect individually, because of the early signal fluctuation, likely affected by the work-piece clamping, work-piece clearance, or the oxide film thickness. Therefore, the BP neural networks were introduced to identify the expulsion defects, which is a mature and stable non-linear pattern recognition method. Testing experiments presented good results with the trained networks and improved the evaluable accuracy effectively in the quality assessment of the resistance spot welding.","resistance spot welding,expulsion fault detection and diagnosis,wavelet decomposition,neural networks,sensor application",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,QUALITY,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/4028/pdf,

This work has direct applications to the fields of physiotherapy and chiropody in terms of preventing and correcting deficiencies in the gait.
Abstract Abnormal foot postures during gait are common sources of pain and pathologies of the lower limbs. Measurements of foot plantar pressures in both dynamic and static conditions can detect these abnormal foot postures and prevent possible pathologies. In this work, a plantar pressure measurement system is developed to identify areas with higher or lower pressure load. This system is composed of an embedded system placed in the insole and a user application. The instrumented insole consists of a low-power microcontroller, seven pressure sensors and a low-energy bluetooth module. The user application receives and shows the insole pressure information in real-time and, finally, provides information about the foot posture. In order to identify the different pressure states and obtain the final information of the study with greater accuracy, a Deep Learning neural network system has been integrated into the user application. The neural network can be trained using a stored dataset in order to obtain the classification results in real-time. Results prove that this system provides an accuracy over 90% using a training dataset of 3000+ steps from 6 different users.","neural networks,e-Health,embedded system,footstep,biomechanical study",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"GAIT,ANALYSIS,PLANTAR,PRESSURE,POSTURE,CLASSIFICATION,KINEMATICS,SYSTEM,PLANUS,SHOES,PAIN",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/3970/pdf,

P-waves cannot reflect various factors such as the types of aggregates and cement, the fine aggregate modulus, and the interfacial transition zone, influencing the concrete strength.

Abstract The accurate localization and classification of lung abnormalities from radiological images are important for clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies. However, multilabel classification, wherein medical images are interpreted to point out multiple existing or suspected pathologies, presents practical constraints. Building a highly precise classification model typically requires a huge number of images manually annotated with labels and finding masks that are expensive to acquire in practice. To address this intrinsically weakly supervised learning problem, we present the integration of different features extracted from shallow handcrafted techniques and a pretrained deep CNN model. The model consists of two main approaches: a localization approach that concentrates adaptively on the pathologically abnormal regions utilizing pretrained DenseNet-121 and a classification approach that integrates four types of local and deep features extracted respectively from SIFT, GIST, LBP, and HOG, and convolutional CNN features. We demonstrate that our approaches efficiently leverage interdependencies among target annotations and establish the state of the art classification results of 14 thoracic diseases in comparison with current reference baselines on the publicly available ChestX-ray14 dataset.","ChestX-ray14,multiple feature integration,shallow features,deep features,convolutional neural network,pretrained model",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,2.736,"CONVOLUTIONAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,SCENE,CLASSIFICATION,MACHINE,SCALE",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/4130/pdf,

Abstract Multi-class classification is a very important technique in engineering applications, e.g., mechanical systems, mechanics and design innovations, applied materials in nanotechnologies, etc. A large amount of research is done for single-label classification where objects are associated with a single category. However, in many application domains, an object can belong to two or more categories, and multi-label classification is needed. Traditionally, statistical methods were used; recently, machine learning techniques, in particular neural networks, have been proposed to solve the multi-class classification problem. In this paper, we develop radial basis function (RBF)-based neural network schemes for single-label and multi-label classification, respectively. The number of hidden nodes and the parameters involved with the basis functions are determined automatically by applying an iterative self-constructing clustering algorithm to the given training dataset, and biases and weights are derived optimally by least squares. Dimensionality reduction techniques are adopted and integrated to help reduce the overfitting problem associated with the RBF networks. Experimental results from benchmark datasets are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","multi-class classification,single-label,multi-label,multi-label,activation function,clustering algorithm",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Chemistry,Engineering,Materials Science,Physics",,,"SELECTION,SYSTEM",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/19/4036/pdf,

This article presents a classification model of support vector machine (SVM) together with a metaheuristic framework using genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and grid searching (GS) optimization algorithms for bacterial foodborne pathogen classification and differentiation. LDA and SVM showed classification accuracies of training (90.3% and 91%) and prediction (89.5% and 90.6%), respectively using the Matlab classification learner app. Optimization of the modeling parameters c and g for SVM were performed to increase efficiency and classification accuracy. Simulated results show classification accuracies of 100% (training set) and 98.95% (prediction set) for five selected bacterial pathogens acquired using electronic nose dataset and PSO-SVM model. Electronic nose recognition system made up of 12 metal oxide semiconductor sensors produced different distinctive response signals for each bacterial and could differentiate Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157: H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, and Salmonella Typhimurium. PSO-SVM algorithm can be efficiently used in bacterial discrimination at the species and strain level by electronic nose and has the good ability both in learning and in generalization. Practical Applications Existing microbial methods depend on traditional culture-based methods which are time-wise lengthy, require trained and qualified personnel, and are not suitable as point-of-use (POU) sensing devices. The application of electronic nose for the detection and classification of bacterial foodborne pathogens have shown great promise and proven to be effective with increasing sensitivity and selectivity as compared to traditional methods. The ability for E-nose to discriminate between individual bacteria colonies at both species and strain level is of great public health importance since most bacteria have many strains. Virulence and pathogenicity are often associated with only a subset of these strains and it is essential for a method to be able to differentiate between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains during a foodborne outbreak.","VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,ALFALFA SPROUTS,IDENTIFICATION,SENSORS,PSO,SALMONELLA,PARAMETERS,FRESHNESS,SELECTION,ARRAY",Article,"WILEY, 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","Engineering,Food Science & Technology",,2.417,"VOLATILE,ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,ALFALFA,SPROUTS,IDENTIFICATION,SENSORS,PSO,SALMONELLA,PARAMETERS,FRESHNESS,SELECTION,ARRAY",JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING,,

Also, 80% and 20% of the total data set were used for training and testing the WNN, respectively, while the statistical parameters for test data set of the proposed NN (MAPE = 6.1310%, RMSE = 0.0468, R-2 = 0.956) were compared with those obtained from conventional NNs, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) (MAPE = 4.1787%, RMSE = 0.0248, R-2 = 0.968) and radial basis function (RBF) (MAPE = 10.0311%, RMSE = 0.0591, R-2 = 0.831). The results indicated that the accuracy of the MLP NN was slightly better than that of the proposed WNN; however, the learning time of WNN was much less than the MLP NN.

V.","Daoud A,Kim R,Subramanian SV",Daoud A,10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112486,Harvard University,"The social determinants of health literature routinely deploy socio-economic status (SES) as a key factor in accounting for women's height-an established indicator of human welfare at the population level-using traditional regression. However, this literature lacks a systematic identification of the predictive power of SES as well as the possible non-linear relationships between the measures of SES (education, occupation, and material wealth) in predicting variation in women's height. This study aims to evaluate this predictive power. We used the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 66 low- and middle-income countries (women = 1,273,644), sampled between 1994 and 2016. The analysis consisted of training seven machine-learning algorithms of different function classes and assessing their predictive power out-of-sample, vis-a-vis OLS regression. In an OLS framework, SES accounts for 0.7%, R-2, of the total variance in women's height (from sigma(2)(OLSFix) = 31.82 to sigma(2)(OLSSES) = 31.57), adjusting for country, community, and sampling year fixed effects. The country-specific variances range from as low as 25.10 units in Egypt to as high as 74.46 units in Sao Tome and Principe. With the same set of SES measures, the best performing learner, a Bayesian neural net, produces a predictive variance of sigma(2)(BnnSES) = 31.52. This is a negligible improvement in variance explained by 0.3% (sigma(2)(BnnSES) - sigma(2)(OLSSES)). Given our selection of algorithms, our findings indicate no relevant non-linear relationships between SES and women's height, and also the predictive limits of SES. We recommend that scholars report both the average effect of SES on health outcomes as well as its contribution to the variance explained. This will improve our understanding of how key social and economic factors affect health, deepening our understanding of the social determinants of health.","Social class,Socio-economic status,Global health,Social determinants of health,Health inequality,Women's height,Machine learning,Prediction",Article,"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD, THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health,Biomedical Social Sciences",,5.299,"LOW-INCOME,DETERMINANTS,HEALTH,UNDERNUTRITION,HERITABILITY,MODELS",SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,,

We performed data augmentation using a method such as flip, rotation, and GAN, in addition to pre-processing and data augmentation for AlexNet, in order to supplement a number of deficient data. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning was simulated using the Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (MSGD) algorithm, and the learning rate was 5e-5, and the epoch was 100.

The SPGC system is capable of measuring the three-dimensional (3D) position of excited gold markers by detecting proton-induced X-ray emissions (PIXEs) generated by the interactions between the gold marker and a proton beam. The SPGC system was modeled using Geant4 according to manufacturer's specifications. The original image (I-o) acquired by using the SPGC system, which was comprised of 32 x 32 arrays over an area of 104 x 104 mm(2), was subjected to resolution enhancement to produce an SR-enhanced image (I-SR) (128 x 128 arrays) through a fully trained SR model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In virtual experiments, two portable gamma cameras were positioned perpendicular to each other. Next, a pair of I-o's were acquired by detecting the radiations from the exited gold marker positioned in a water phantom. Then, the fully trained SR model improved the quality of the I-o's by converting those to I-SR's. The 3D position of the radiation source was calculated by using Anger logic and 3D vector calculations. Virtual experiments for in vivo proton range verification using the SPGC system were performed by irradiating to a gold marker in a water phantom with a proton beam. A gold marker was placed at five different positions along the Bragg curve of a 100.0-MeV proton beam, which had a range of 74.5 mm in water. The proton beam was irradiated to deliver 20.0 Gy to the gold marker when it was positioned at the center of the Bragg peak; then, the PIXEs were measured by using the SPGC system. When a gold marker was at a different position, it was irradiated with the same dose for a quantitative comparison. Then 3D position of the gold marker was calculated for the original image (I-o) and for the high-resolution image (I-SR) to compare the detection accuracy. The averaged root-mean-square errors of the five positions between the reference and calculation for I-o and I-SR were 9.127 mm and 3.991 mm, respectively.

Furthermore, computation workstations suited for deep learning are usually equipped with multiple GPUs allowing for workload distribution among multiple GPUs for larger datasets while exploiting parallelism in each GPU. In this paper, we utilize distributed and parallel computation techniques to efficiently analyze healthcare data using deep learning techniques. We demonstrate the scalability and computational benefits of this approach with a case study of longitudinal assessment of approximately 150 000 type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the fourth case of mortality worldwide with rising prevalence. T2DM leads to adverse events such as acute myocardial infarction, major amputations, and avoidable hospitalizations. This paper aims to establish a relation between laboratory and medical assessment variables with the occurrence of the aforementioned adverse events and its prediction using machine learning techniques. We use a raw database provided by Basque Health Service, Spain, to conduct this study. This database contains 150 156 patients diagnosed with T2DM, from whom 321 laboratory and medical assessment variables recorded over four years are available. Predictions of adverse events on T2DM patients using both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques were performed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as metrics. The best performance for the prediction of acute myocardial infarction is obtained by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) both balanced and weight models with an accuracy of 97%; hospital admission for avoidable causes best performance is obtained by LDA balanced and SVMs balanced both with an accuracy of 92%.

Altogether 65 different ANN architecture have been trained and tested using 6 different training algorithms to find out ANN with best prediction capability. 3-11-1 ANN architecture trained using BPNN with Bayesian regularization shows best prediction capability (mean square error 3.24E-04) and considered as Best ANN. That ANN will be useful for determining required value of welding process parameters to yield a specific welding strength and suitable for online process monitoring and control. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted and it is found that, maximum welding strength can be obtained with low wire feed rate (4 m/min), low welding speed (2 m/min) and high laser power (3 kW).","Hybrid CO2 laser-MIG welding,Artificial neural networks,Sensitivity analysis",Article,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,,"MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,FEEDFORWARD,NETWORKS,ALUMINUM-ALLOY,OPTIMIZATION",SN APPLIED SCIENCES,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-019-1264-z.pdf,

In this investigation, influences of typical flotation frothers (methyl isobutyl carbinol and pine oil) in different concentrations (0.01, 0.10, and 1.00 g/L) were examined on activates of bacteria in the mesophilic mixed culture (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans). For comparison purposes, experiments were repeated by pure cultures of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans in the same conditions. Results indicated that increasing the dosage of frothers has a negative correlation with bacteria activities while the mixed culture showed a lower sensitivity to the toxicity of these frothers in comparison with examined pure cultures. Outcomes showed the toxicity of Pine oil is lower than methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC).

Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that, combined with wearable sensors, can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements.

Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation (r = 0.96 using held-out testing and r = 0.93 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation (r = 0.84 using held-out testing and r = 0.77 using subject-based, leave-one-out cross-validation).

Estimation of these properties is central in well placement, drilling programs, and well completion design. The elastic behavior of rocks can be studied by determining two main parameters: Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Accurate determination of the Poisson's ratio helps to estimate the in-situ horizontal stresses and in turn, avoid many critical problems which interrupt drilling operations, such as pipe sticking and wellbore instability issues. Accurate Poisson's ratio values can be experimentally determined using retrieved core samples under simulated in-situ downhole conditions. However, this technique is time-consuming and economically ineffective, requiring the development of a more effective technique. This study has developed a new generalized model to estimate static Poisson's ratio values of sandstone rocks using a supervised artificial neural network (ANN). The developed ANN model uses well log data such as bulk density and sonic log as the input parameters to target static Poisson's ratio values as outputs. Subsequently, the developed ANN model was transformed into a more practical and easier to use white-box mode using an ANN-based empirical equation. Core data (692 data points) and their corresponding petrophysical data were used to train and test the ANN model. The self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) algorithm was used to fine-tune the parameters of the ANN model to obtain the most accurate results in terms of the highest correlation coefficient (R) and the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results obtained from the optimized ANN model show an excellent agreement with the laboratory measured static Poisson's ratio, confirming the high accuracy of the developed model. A comparison of the developed ANN-based empirical correlation with the previously developed approaches demonstrates the superiority of the developed correlation in predicting static Poisson's ratio values with the highest R and the lowest MAPE. The developed correlation performs in a manner far superior to other approaches when validated against unseen field data. The developed ANN-based mathematical model can be used as a robust tool to estimate static Poisson's ratio without the need to run the ANN model.","elastic parameters,Poisson's ratio,sandstone,artificial neural network,self-adaptive differential evolution",Article,"MDPI, ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","Science & Technology - Other Topics,Environmental Sciences & Ecology",,3.473,"POISSONS,RATIO,LOG,DATA,MACHINE,RESERVOIR,PERMEABILITY,OPTIMIZATION,ALGORITHMS",SUSTAINABILITY,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/19/5283/pdf,

However, there is some controversy about the existence of additional subtypes. Our aim was to study the language and cognitive features associated with a new proposed classification for PPA.
Material and methods: Sixty-eight patients with PPA in early stages of the disease and 20 healthy controls were assessed with a comprehensive language and cognitive protocol. They were also evaluated with F-18-FDG positron emision tomography (PET). Patients were classified according to FDG PET regional metabolism, using our previously developed algorithm based on a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis with Ward's linkage method. Five variants were found, with both the non-fluent and logopenic variants being split into 2 subtypes. Machine learning techniques were used to predict each variant according to language assessment results.
Results: Non-fluent type 1 was associated with poorer performance in repetition of sentences and reading of irregular words than non-fluent type 2. Conversely, the second group showed a higher degree of apraxia of speech. Patients with logopenic variant type 1 performed more poorly on action naming than patients with logopenic type 2. Language assessments were predictive of PET-based subtypes in 86%-89% of cases using clustering analysis and principal components analysis.
Conclusions: Our study supports the existence of 5 variants of PPA. These variants show some differences in language and FDG PET imaging characteristics. Machine learning algorithms using language test data were able to predict each of the 5 PPA variants with a relatively high degree of accuracy, and enable the possibility of automated, machine-aided diagnosis of PPA variants.

Decades of research have identified key properties of nanomaterials that induce adverse responses, and this evidence suggests that the toxicity of a nanoparticle can be inferred from its abiotic behavior. Experimental physical-chemical characterization of nanoparticles, however, is complex and time consuming, and the absence of any standardized method has generated controversial results. This paper shows how known adverse modes of action of nanoparticles arise from fundamental physical-chemical parameters that don't need any experimental quantification. We show that cytotoxicity of metal oxides in different types of in vitro systems, which include E. coli, rat alveolar macrophages, human bronchial epithelial cells, Daphnia magna, and Aliivibrio fischeri, can be foreseen on the basis of the values of oxidation number (Z) and ionic potential (IP) of the cation, and surface reducibility (SR), and redox reactivity (RR) of the oxide. Importantly, the values of these fundamental physical-chemical parameters can be easily deduced from the chemical formula of the nanoparticle with the help of a periodic table. Combining these parameters in a naive Bayes classifier, a robust probabilistic model that can be run on a pocket calculator, makes it possible to determine the most probable level of toxicity of a nanoparticle given its composition. Results indicate that the probability that nano-oxides exhibit very high cytotoxicity (EC50 < 10(-3) mol L-1) decreases with increasing oxidation number Z of the cation; high values of Z, however, may become unstable and activate adverse redox processes; in contrast, stable, redox-inert reducible oxides tend to be, probabilistically, less toxic than oxidizable ones.","IN-VITRO,ENGINEERED NANOPARTICLES,SURFACE-PROPERTIES,OXIDATIVE STRESS,TOXICITY,NANOSAFETY,VACANCY,SAFETY,SIZE,BAND",Article,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY, THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND","Chemistry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Science & Technology - Other Topics",,8.3,"IN-VITRO,ENGINEERED,NANOPARTICLES,SURFACE-PROPERTIES,OXIDATIVE,STRESS,TOXICITY,NANOSAFETY,VACANCY,SAFETY,SIZE,BAND",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO,,

However, recent developments in smart electronics, such as a direct human-machine interface, health-monitoring devices, motion-tracking sensors, and artificially electronic skin also require materials with multifunctional properties such as transparency, flexibility and good portability. In such devices, there remains room to develop transparent and flexible devices such as pressure sensors or temperature sensors. Herein, we demonstrate a fully transparent and flexible bimodal sensor using indium tin oxide (ITO), which is embedded in a plastic substrate. For the proposed pressure sensor, the embedded ITO is detached from its Mayan-pyramid-structured silicon mold by an environmentally friendly method which utilizes water-soluble sacrificial layers. The Mayan-pyramid-based pressure sensor is capable of six different pressure sensations with excellent sensitivity in the range of 100 Pa-10 kPa, high endurance of 10(5) cycles, and good pulse detection and tactile sensing data processing capabilities through machine learning (ML) algorithms for different surface textures. A 5 x 5-pixel pressure-temperature-based bimodal sensor array with a zigzag-shaped ITO temperature sensor on top of it is also demonstrated without a noticeable interface effect. This work demonstrates the potential to develop transparent bimodal sensors that can be employed for electronic skin (E-skin) applications.","SELF-POWERED PRESSURE,ARRAY,TEMPERATURE,HEALTH,EVOLUTION,ELECTRODE,NETWORKS,FILMS,SKIN",Article,"NATURE RESEARCH, HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",Science & Technology - Other Topics,,5.134,"SELF-POWERED,PRESSURE,ARRAY,TEMPERATURE,HEALTH,EVOLUTION,ELECTRODE,NETWORKS,FILMS,SKIN",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50247-4.pdf,

For determining whether to repair the stilling basin slabs, periodic inspections of erosion condition of stilling basin slabs are required. The practical problem is how to get the underwater image without unwatering and how to analyse the abrasion though the images. This paper developed a novel underwater inspection system named UIS-1 which consists of a customized underwater robot and special quantitative analysis method for this situation. Firstly, the integrated component was designed for the underwater robot that partially removes the siltation and obtains the image of the concrete surface of stilling basin slabs in the desired position. Secondly, the paper proposed an image algorithm to obtain aggregate exposure ratio for quantitative abrasion analysis. This image algorithm used SLIC superpixel and the SVM machine learning method to detect the coarse aggregate exposure automatically. Then, the aggregate exposure ratio was calculated to analyse the degree of abrasion. Finally, the UIS-1 system was evaluated in the field experiments of a dam in Sichuan, China, and its performance was discussed by comparison.","CRACK DETECTION,VISUAL INSPECTION,CLASSIFICATION,CONCRETE",Article,"HINDAWI LTD, ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","Construction & Building Technology,Engineering",,1.923,"CRACK,DETECTION,VISUAL,INSPECTION,CLASSIFICATION,CONCRETE",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2019/6924976.pdf,

Their preparation is typically defined by multiple interconnected variables (e.g., reagent sources, molar ratios, aging treatments, reaction time and temperature, among others), but unfortunately their distinctive influence, particularly on the nucleation and crystallization processes, is still far from being understood. Thus, the discovery and/or optimization of specific zeolites is closely related to the exploration of the parametric space through trial-and-error methods, generally by studying the influence of each parameter individually.
In the past decade, machine learning (ML) methods have rapidly evolved to address complex problems involving highly nonlinear or massively combinatorial processes that conventional approaches cannot solve. Considering the vast and interconnected multiparametric space in zeolite synthesis, coupled with our poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in their nucleation and crystallization, the use of ML is especially timely for improving zeolite synthesis. Indeed, the complex space of zeolite synthesis requires draWing inferences from incomplete and imperfect information, for which ML methods are very well-suited to replace the intuition-based approaches traditionally used to guide experimentation.
In this Account, we contend that both existing and new ML approaches can provide the ""missing link"" needed to complete the traditional zeolite synthesis workflow used in our quest to rationalize zeolite synthesis. Within this context, we have made important efforts on developing ML tools in different critical areas, such as (1) data-mining tools to process the large amount of data generated using high-throughput platforms; (2) novel complex algorithms to predict the formation of energetically stable hypothetical zeolites and guide the synthesis of new zeolite structures; (3) new ""ab initio"" organic structure directing agent predictions to direct the synthesis of hypothetical or known zeolites; (4) an automated tool for nonsupervised data extraction and classification from published research articles.
ML has already revolutionized many areas in materials science by enhancing our ability to map intricate behavior to process variables, especially in the absence of well-understood mechanisms. Undoubtedly, ML is a burgeoning field with many future opportunities for further breakthroughs to advance the design of molecular sieves. For this reason, this Account includes an outlook of future research directions based on current challenges and opportunities. We envision this Account will become a hallmark reference for both well-established and new researchers in the field of zeolite synthesis.","STRUCTURE-DIRECTING AGENTS,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,X-RAY-DIFFRACTION,HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS,MOLECULAR-SIEVE,COMBINATORIAL,DESIGN,METHODOLOGY,PREDICTION,FRAMEWORKS",Review,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC, 1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Chemistry,,22.732,"STRUCTURE-DIRECTING,AGENTS,ARTIFICIAL,NEURAL-NETWORKS,X-RAY-DIFFRACTION,HYDROTHERMAL,SYNTHESIS,MOLECULAR-SIEVE,COMBINATORIAL,DESIGN,METHODOLOGY,PREDICTION,FRAMEWORKS",ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/10251/150684/3/Moliner%3bRom%c3%a1n-Leshkov%3bCorma%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20Applied%20to%20Zeolite%20Synthesis%3a%20The%20Missing%20Link%20for....pdf,

A backpropagation network with two hidden layers has been used to investigate and optimize the effects of the Reynolds number, volume fraction and nanoparticle diameter on heat transfer, pressure drop and entropy generation. In order to train the network, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been applied. The results of a total of 168 sample models, considering the extended range of input data, have been prepared as the training data for the network. The precision of the network based on the mean squared error for a set of random experimental data has been approximately 0.05. The obtained results of the artificial neural network are presented in an extended range of Re, phi and particle diameter. Results indicate that heat transfer enhancement is achieved by increasing Re and volume fraction. While augmenting Re reduces the friction factor, it is increased at higher volume fractions.

Esophageal resection with gastric pull-up is a potentially curative therapeutic option. After this procedure, the specimen is examined by the pathologist to confirm complete removal of the cancer. An intraoperative analysis of the resectate would be less time-consuming and therefore improve patient safety. Methods Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a relatively new modality, which has shown promising results for the detection of tumors. Automatic approaches could support the surgeon in the visualization of tumor margins. Therefore, we evaluated four supervised classification algorithms: random forest, support vector machines (SVM), multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors to differentiate malignant from healthy tissue based on HSI recordings of esophago-gastric resectates in 11 patients. Results The best performances were obtained with a cancerous tissue detection of 63% sensitivity and 69% specificity with the SVM. In a leave-one patient-out cross-validation, the classification showed larger performance differences according to the patient data used. In less than 1 s, data classification and visualization was shown. Conclusion In this work, we successfully tested several classification algorithms for the automatic detection of esophageal carcinoma in resected tissue. A larger data set and a combination of several methods would probably increase the performance. Moreover, the implementation of software tools for intraoperative tumor boundary visualization will further support the surgeon during oncologic operations.","Hyperspectral imaging (HSI),Cancer detection,Machine learning,Visceral surgery",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Engineering,Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging,Surgery",,2.745,"ENDOSCOPY,THERAPY,CANCER",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,,

This method can be combined with optical enhancement methods such as narrow band imaging (NBI). However, these techniques have some problems like subjective interpretation of vascular patterns and difficulty in differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. We propose a novel automated approach for vessel pattern characterization of larynx CE + NBI images in order to solve these problems. Methods In this approach, five indicators were computed to characterize the level of vessel's disorder based on evaluation of consistency of gradient and two-dimensional curvature analysis and then 24 features were extracted from these indicators. The method evaluated the ability of the extracted features to classify CE + NBI images based on the vascular pattern and based on the laryngeal lesions. Four datasets were generated from 32 patients involving 1485 images. The classification scenarios were implemented using four supervised classifiers. Results For classification of CE + NBI images based on the vascular pattern, polykernel support vector machine (SVM), SVM with radial basis function (RBF), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest (RF) show an accuracy of 97%, 96%, 96%, and 96%, respectively.

In order to avoid image artifacts caused by patient movement during imaging, we take deep learning-based methods to generate DSA image from single live image without the mask image. Methods Conventional clinical DSA datasets are acquired with a standard injection protocol. More than 600 sequences obtained from more than 100 subjects were used for head and leg experiments. Here, the residual dense block (RDB) is adopted to generate DSA image from single live image directly, and RDBs can extract high-level features by dense connected layers. To obtain better vessel details, a supervised generative adversarial network strategy is also used in the training stage. Results The human head and leg experiments show that the deep learning methods can generate DSA image from single live image, and our method can do better than other models.

Materials and Methods A 3D inversion-prepared balanced steady-state free precession sequence was used for acquiring in vivo multicontrast brain images. The deep neural network contained three residual blocks, and each block had 8 fully connected layers with sigmoid activation, layer norm, and 256 neurons in each layer. Online-synthesized MR signal evolutions and labels were used to train the neural network batch-by-batch. Empirically defined ranges of T1 and T2 values for the normal gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used as the prior knowledge. MRI brain experiments were performed on three healthy volunteers. The mean and standard deviation for the T1 and T2 values in vivo were reported and compared to literature values. Additional animal (N = 6) and prostate patient (N = 1) experiments were performed to compare the estimated T1 and T2 values with those from gold standard methods and to demonstrate clinical applications of the proposed method. Results In animal validation experiment, the differences/errors (mean difference +/- standard deviation of difference) between the T1 and T2 values estimated from the proposed method and the ground truth were 113 +/- 486 and 154 +/- 512 ms for T1, and 5 +/- 33 and 7 +/- 41 ms for T2, respectively. In healthy volunteer experiments (N = 3), whole brain segmentation and relaxometry were finished within ~ 5 s.

In this study, a new hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system, SOS-LSSVR, has been proposed to predict the permanent deformation potential of asphalt pavement mixtures. SOS-LSSVR utilizes the symbiotic organisms search (SOS) and the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR), which are seen as a complementary system. The prediction model can be established from all input and output data pairs for LSSVR, while SOS optimizes the system's tuning parameters. To avoid sampling bias and to partition the dataset into testing and training, a cross-validation technique was chosen. The results can be compared to those of previous studies and other predictive methods. Through the use of four error indicators, SOS-LSSVR accuracy was verified in predicting the permanent deformation behavior of an asphalt mixture. The present study demonstrates that the proposed AI system is a valuable decision-making tool for road designers.

AFMs have three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and manipulation. In the force measurement, AFM can be used to measure the forces between the probe and the sample as a function of their mutual separation. AFM compared to scanning electron microscope has a single image scan size; also the scanning speed of AFM is also a limitation. AFM images can also be affected by nonlinearity, hysteresis, creep of the piezoelectric material, and cross talk between the x, y, and z axes that may require software enhancement and filtering. Due to the nature of AFM probes, they cannot normally measure steep walls or overhangs in surface. In this study, the force between the Probe of Atomic Microscope and the surface is simulated by using force measurement ability of AFM and artificial neural network. The experimental data are used for training of artificial neural networks.

The artificial neural network model uses molding moisture content (w), curing time (t) and porosity/volumetric lime (eta/L-v ') as input parameters and unconfined compressive strength as the output parameter. Bayesian regularization as training function with sigmoid and pure linear at hidden and output layers is used for modeling the artificial neural network. The proposed response surface methodology designed ANN model is comparable with the conventional designed ANN model and can be used effectively with significantly less number of data set. Sensitivity analysis, to make out the significant input factors based on connection-weight approach, is also discussed. Further, neural interpretation diagram is incorporated to study the effects of individual input parameters over the response. Finally, a predictive equation is presented based on response surface methodology designed artificial neural network model for the range of parameters studied.","Bauxite residue,Unconfined compressive strength,Artificial neural network,Sensitivity analysis,Response surface methodology",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,5.573,"UNCONFINED,COMPRESSIVE,STRENGTH,NEURAL-NETWORK,RED,MUD,PREDICTION,OPTIMIZATION,SOILS,INTELLIGENCE,PARAMETERS,POLLUTION,CAPACITY",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,,

Automatic classification of EEG signals is gradually becoming the research focus, which contains two procedures: feature extraction and classification. In the phase of feature extraction, a hybrid feature extraction method is proposed and the features are derived by performing linear and nonlinear feature extraction methods, which can describe abundant properties of original EEG signals. In order to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, feature selection based on class separability is employed to select the optimal feature subset. In the phase of classification, this paper presents a novel ensemble extreme learning machine based on linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is used to transform training subsets that are generated by bootstrap method, through which we can increase the differences of basic classifiers and reduce generalization errors of ensemble extreme learning machine. Experiments on two different EEG datasets are conducted in this study. Class separability is investigated to verify the effectiveness of feature extraction methods. The overall classification results show that compared with other similar studies, the proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of EEG signals classification.","EEG signals,Classification,Feature extraction,Ensemble extreme learning machine",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Computer Science,,2.884,"FEATURE-SELECTION,LYAPUNOV,EXPONENTS,NEURAL-NETWORKS,EPILEPSY,TRANSFORM,DIAGNOSIS,PATTERNS,SEIZURES,ENTROPY",NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS,,

Many studies have been conducted on machine learning techniques that seek brain imaging data for specific biomarkers of disorders. These studies have encountered the following dilemma: A direct classification overfits to a small number of high-dimensional samples but unsupervised feature-extraction has the risk of extracting a signal of no interest. In addition, such studies often provided only diagnoses for patients without presenting the reasons for these diagnoses. This study proposed a deep neural generative model of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The proposed model is conditioned by the assumption of the subject's state and estimates the posterior probability of the subject's state given the imaging data, using Bayes' rule. This study applied the proposed model to diagnose schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by a large margin over competitive approaches, namely classifications of functional connectivity, discriminative/generative models of regionwise signals, and those with unsupervised feature-extractors. The proposed model visualizes brain regions largely related to the disorders, thus motivating further biological investigation.","Deep learning,generative model,functional magnetic resonance imaging,psychiatric-disorder diagnosis,schizophrenia,bipolar disorder",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"BIPOLAR,DISORDER,TEMPORAL,GYRUS,SCHIZOPHRENIA,CONNECTIVITY,ABNORMALITIES,BIOMARKERS,REGRESSION,NETWORKS,DYNAMICS,VOLUME",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06260,

In current clinical practice, cardiovascular state is inferred through measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and reliance on linear approximations between pressure and flow to estimate peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanical circulatory support devices residing within the left ventricle and aorta provide an opportunity for both determining cardiac and vascular state and offering therapeutic benefit. We leverage the controllable mode of operation and transvalvular position of an indwelling percutaneous ventricular assist device to assess vascular and, in turn, cardiac state through the effects of device-arterial coupling across different levels of device support. Methods: Vascular state is determined by measuring changes in the pressure waveforms induced through intentional variation in the device generated blood flow. We evaluate this impact by applying a lumped parameter model to quantify state-specific vascular resistance and compliance and calculate beat-to-beat stroke volume and cardiac output in both animal models and retrospective patient data without external calibration. Results: Vascular state was accurately predicted in patients and animals in both baseline and experimental conditions. In the animal, stroke volume was predicted within a total root mean square error of 3.71 mL (n = 482). Conclusion: We demonstrate that device-arterial coupling is a powerful tool for evaluating patient and state specific parameters of cardiovascular function. Significance: These insights may yield improved clinical care and support the development of next generation mechanical circulatory support devices that determine and operate in tandem with the supported organ.","Cardiac output,vascular resistance,mechanical circulatory support,cardiogenic shock,vascular coupling",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Engineering,,5.337,"MECHANICAL,CIRCULATORY,SUPPORT,ACUTE,MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,CARDIOGENIC-SHOCK,FLUID,RESPONSIVENESS,RESPIRATORY,CHANGES,HEART,PUMP,MANAGEMENT,KNOWLEDGE,PRESSURE",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/126798/2/nihms-1024477.pdf,

In particular, the methods are categorized by different types of neuromarkers. The second part of the review is dedicated to a series of investigations that further highlight the differences between these two modalities.

The inferences drawn from IHC-stained images depend to a great extent on the quality of immunostaining, which is in turn affected strongly by assay parameters. To optimize assay parameters, the available tissue sample is often limited. Moreover, with current practices in pathology, exploring the entire assay parameter space is not feasible. Thus, the evaluation of IHC stained slides is conventionally a subjective task, in which diagnoses are commonly drawn on images that are suboptimal. In this work, we introduce a framework to analyze IHC staining quality and its sensitivity to process parameters. To that extent, first histopathological sections are segmented automatically. Then, machine learning techniques are employed to extract disease-specific staining quality metrics (SQMs) targeting a quantitative assessment of staining quality. Finally, an approach to efficiently analyze the parameter space is introduced to infer sensitivity to process parameters. We present results on microscale IHC tissue samples of five breast tumor classes, based on disease state and protein expression. A disease-type classification F1-score of 0.82 and a contrast-level classification F1-score of 0.95 were achieved. With the proposed SQMs, an area under the curve of 0.85 was achieved on average over different disease types.

Lots of physical models specifically used for permeability prediction have been created in recent decades, but calculation parameters involved in the models must be determined through core experiments. In order to reduce reliance on the usage of the data generated by core experiments, statistical prediction methods for permeability are developed. Support vector regression (SVR) is one of the optimal prediction approaches that can perfectly reveal the nonlinear relationship between permeability and other geological parameters, while its performance is severely limited by qualities of input data and calculation parameters. Colinear issue regarding variables of input data and bad initialization of calculation parameters can cause failure of fitting equation establishment. Thus, in view of those demerits, two techniques, deep learning and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are introduced to enhance the calculation capability of SVR. Then, a hybrid data-driven model which consists of deep learning network, PSO, and SVR is proposed. Data for method validation is recorded by three wells of the LULA oilfield. Two experiments are designed by the validation data. Experiment results prove that the proposed method has the capability to produce more accurate predicted results than those provided by single SVR and PSO-SVR. Consequently, the new hybrid data-driven model is effective in predicting permeability under processing real data.","Permeability prediction,Continuous restricted Boltzmann machine,Particle swarm optimization,Support vector regression",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",Geology,,1.985,"ASPHALTENE,PRECIPITATION,PETROLEUM,RESERVOIRS,CONNECTIONIST,MODEL,STRUCTURAL,STYLES,GAS-RESERVOIR,PRESSURE,POROSITY,MACHINE,LOGS,EFFICIENCY",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,,

While effective for prediction, these methodologies yield models that are difficult to interpret. In addition, many studies focus on classifying comments as either negative or neutral, rather than further separating negative comments into subcategories. To address both of these concerns, we introduce a two-stage model for classifying text. With this model, we illustrate the use of internal lexicons, collections of words generated from a preclassified training dataset of comments that are specific to several subcategories of negative comments. In the first stage, a machine learning algorithm classifies each comment as negative or neutral, or more generally target or nontarget. The second stage of model building leverages the internal lexicons (called L2CLs) to create features specific to each subcategory. These features, along with others, are then used in a random forest model to classify the comments into the subcategories of interest. We demonstrate our approach using two sets of data.

Seven subjects diagnosed with SBO by CT were included in the study. For each subject, an obstructed segment of bowel was chosen. Three observers annotated the centerline of the segment by manual fiducial placement and by visual fiducial placement using a Tobii 4c eye tracker. Each annotation was repeated three times. The distance between centerlines was calculated after alignment using dynamic time warping (DTW) and statistically compared to clinical thresholds for diagnosis of SBO. Intra-observer DTW distance between manual and visual centerlines was calculated as a measure of accuracy. These distances were 1.1 +/- 0.2, 1.3 +/- 0.4, and 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm for the three observers and were less than 1.5 cm for two of three observers (P < 0.01).

The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha(-1), and a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions.","Yield forecast,Empirical yield prediction,Remote sensing,Machine learning,Random forest,Feature extraction,Precision agriculture",Article,"SPRINGER, VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Agriculture,,5.004,"WHEAT,MODEL",PRECISION AGRICULTURE,,

This study assessed the feasibility of using machine learning to differentiate uterine sarcomas from leiomyomas with high signal intensity on T2WI on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 80 patients (50 with benign leiomyoma and 30 with uterine sarcoma) who underwent pelvic 3 T magnetic resonance imaging examination for the evaluation of uterine myometrial smooth muscle masses with high signal intensity on T2WI. We used six machine learning techniques to develop prediction models based on 12 texture parameters on T1WI and T2WI, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and contrast-enhanced T1WI, as well as tumor size and age. We calculated the areas under the curve (AUCs) using receiver-operating characteristic analysis for each model by 10-fold cross-validation and compared these to those for two board-certified radiologists.
Results: The eXtreme Gradient Boosting model gave the highest AUC (0.93), followed by the random forest, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression models. Age was the most important factor for differentiation (leiomyoma 44.9 +/- 11.1 years; sarcoma 58.9 +/- 14.7 years; p < 0.001). The AUC for the eXtreme Gradient Boosting was significantly higher than those for both radiologists (0.93 vs 0.80 and 0.68, p = 0.03 and p < 0.001, respectively).
Conclusion: Machine learning outperformed experienced radiologists in the differentiation of uterine sarcomas from leiomyomas with high signal intensity on T2WI.","Magnetic resonance imaging,Uterine neoplasm,Leiomyoma,Machine learning,Sarcoma",Article,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC, STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,2.751,"TEXTURE,ANALYSIS,REDUCTION,TECHNIQUES,DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY,MR,BENIGN,TUMORS,CLASSIFICATION,FEASIBILITY",ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY,,

In this paper, the fusion of sensing modalities that monitor the oxygenation of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cardiovascular physiology was evaluated to differentiate between rest, mental arithmetic, and N-back memory tasks. A flexible headband to measure near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for quantifying PFC oxygenation, and forehead photo-plethysmography for assessing peripheral cardiovascular activity was designed. Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram and seismocardiogram were collected, along with the measurements obtained using the headband. The setup was tested and validated with a total of 16 human subjects performing a series of arithmetic and N-back memory tasks. Features extracted were related to cardiac and peripheral sympathetic activity, vasomotor tone, pulse wave propagation, and oxygenation. Machine learning techniques were utilized to classify rest, arithmetic, and N-back tasks, using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Macro-averaged accuracy of 85%, precision of 84%, recall rate of 83%, and F1 score of 80% were obtained from the classification of the three states. Statistical analyses on the subject-based results demonstrate that the fusion of NIRS and peripheral cardiovascular sensing significantly improves the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, compared to using NIRS sensing alone. Moreover, the fusion significantly improves the precision compared to peripheral cardiovascular sensing alone. The results of this paper can be used in the future to design a multi-modal wearable sensing system for classifying mental state for applications such as acute stress detection.","Sensor fusion,mental stress classification,near-infrared spectroscopy,wearable sensing",Article,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC, 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","Engineering,Instruments & Instrumentation,Physics",,3.441,"HEART-RATE,EEG,METAANALYSIS,FREQUENCY,BCI",IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7731966,

However, the patterns, stock, and environmental controls of SOC in semiarid alpine regions are still less understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively quantify the stock and controls of SOC in semiarid alpine regions. Materials and methods Soils from 138 study sites across a typical semiarid alpine basin (1755-5051 m, similar to 1 x 10(4) km(2)) are sampled at 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm. SOC content, bulk density, soil texture, and soil pH are determined. Both a classical statistical model (i.e., a multiple linear regression, MLR) and a machine learning technique (i.e., a random forest, RF) are applied to estimate the SOC stock at a basin scale. The study further quantifies the environmental controls of SOC based on a general linear model (GLM) coupled with the structural equation modeling (SEM). Results and discussion SOC density varies significantly with topographic factors, with the highest values occurring at an elevation zone of similar to 3400 m. The results show that the SOC is more accurately estimated by the RF compared to the MLR model, with a total stock of 219.33 Tg C and an average density of 21.25 kg C m(-2) at 0-60 cm across the study basin. The GLM approach reveals that the topography is seen to explain about 58.11% of the total variation in SOC density at 0-10 cm, of which the largest two proportions are attributable to the elevation (44.32%) and the aspect factor (11.25%). The SEM approach further indicates that, of the climatic, vegetative, and edaphic factors examined, the mean annual temperature, which is mainly shaped by topography, exerts the most significant control on SOC, mainly through its direct effect, and also, through indirect effect as delivered by vegetation type. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the presence of high stocks of organic carbon in soils of semiarid alpine regions, indicating a fundamental role played by topography in affecting the overall SOC, which is mainly attained through its effects on the mean annual temperature.","Random forest,Semiarid alpine regions,Soil organic carbon,Structural equation modeling,Topography",Article,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG, TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Agriculture",,3.587,"HEIHE,RIVER-BASIN,QILIAN,MOUNTAINS,NITROGEN,STOCKS,TOPOGRAPHIC,ASPECT,RANDOM,FORESTS,LOESS,PLATEAU,SCALE,LAND,REGRESSION,SEQUESTRATION",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,,

Radiomics-based machine learning (ML) could provide a more accurate tool.
Purpose: To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomics-based ML with that of visual and histogram-based assessment of ex vivo coronary CT angiography cross sections to identify advanced atherosclerotic lesions defined with histologic examination.
Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 21 coronary arteries from seven hearts obtained from male donors (mean age, 52.3 years +/- 5.3) were imaged ex vivo with coronary CT angiography between February 23, 2009, and July 31, 2010. From 95 coronary plaques, 611 histologic cross sections were coregistered with coronary CT cross sections. Lesions were considered advanced if early fibroatheroma, late fibroatheroma, or thin-cap atheroma was present. CT cross sections were classified as showing homogeneous, heterogeneous, or napkin-ring sign plaques on the basis of visual assessment. The area of low attenuation (<30 HU) and the average Hounsfield unit were quantified. Radiomic parameters were extracted and used as inputs to ML algorithms. Eight radiomics-based ML models were trained on randomly selected cross sections (training set, 75% of the cross sections) to identify advanced lesions. Visual assessment, histogram-based assessment, and the best ML model were compared on the remaining 25% of the data (validation set) by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to identify advanced lesions.
Results: After excluding sections with no visible plaque (n = 134) and with heavy calcium (n = 32), 445 cross sections were analyzed. Of those 445 cross sections, 134 (30.1%) were advanced lesions. Visual assessment of the 445 cross sections indicated that 207 (46.5%) were homogeneous, 200 (44.9%) were heterogeneous, and 38 (8.5%) demonstrated the napkin-ring sign. A radiomics-based ML model incorporating 13 parameters outperformed visual assessment (AUC = 0.73 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.63, 0.84 vs 0.65 with 95% CI of 0.56, 0.73, respectively; P = .04), area of low attenuation (AUC = 0.55 with 95% CI of 0.42, 0.68; P = .01), and average Hounsfield unit (AUC = 0.53 with 95% CI of 0.42, 0.65; P = .004) in the identification of advanced atheromatous lesions.
Conclusion: Radiomics-based machine learning analysis improves the discriminatory power of coronary CT angiography in the identification of advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

Methods: We constructed emotion-related brain networks with phase locking value and adopted a multiple feature fusion approach to combine the compensative activation and connection information for emotion recognition. Results: Recognition results on three public emotional databases demonstrated that the combined features are superior to either single feature based on power distribution or network character. Furthermore, the conducted feature fusion analysis revealed the common characters between activation and connection patterns involved in the positive, neutral, and negative emotions for information processing.

This study aims to 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene based on the disparity map generated by the depth estimation algorithm.

In this work, we use dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms to reduce the computation time of complex OPC/EPC problems while the prediction accuracy is maintained. Also, we implement a pure machine learning approach where the input masks are directly mapped to the output etched patterns. While one photolithographic mask can generate many experimental patterns at once, our pure ML-based approach can shorten the trial-and-error period in the photolithographic correction.

In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a medical intelligent computing system and a series of algorithms for the clinical pathology of cervical cancer based on the multi-scale imaging and transfer learning framework. Firstly, based on data dimensions, imaging errors and other factors, this paper designs a multi-scale time-sharing elastic imaging algorithm based on image reconstruction time and data sample characteristics. Then, taking the burst imaging cohort and the calculation data set of new cervical cancer cases as the objects, based on the difficulties of cervical cancer feature modeling, this paper proposes the transfer learning algorithm of clinical and pathological features of cervical cancer. Finally, a medical intelligent computing system for cervical cancer pathology analysis and calculation with high efficiency and reliability is established. A series of proposed algorithms are compared with single-scale Retinex (SSR), which is based on single-scale Retinex migration learning (SSR-TL). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm in cervical cancer pathological imaging and scoring, as well as the feature extraction and recognition of lesions, especially the efficiency of system execution, is obviously due to the comparison algorithm.","Time-sharing,Multiscale,Multiscale,Transfer learning,Medical intelligent computing",Article,"SPRINGER, ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","Health Care Sciences & Services,Medical Informatics",,3.951,KNOWLEDGE,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,,

To tackle increasingly complex images, artificial intelligence-based approaches have emerged to overcome the shortcomings of traditional feature detection methods. Owing to the fact that most artificial intelligence research is made publicly accessible and programming the required algorithms is now possible in many popular languages, the use of such approaches is becoming widespread. However, these methods often require data labelled by the researcher to provide a training target for the algorithms to converge to the desired result. This labelling is a limiting factor in many cases and can become prohibitively time consuming. Inspired by the ability of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks to perform style transfer, we outline a method whereby a computer-generated set of images is used to segment the true images. We benchmark our unsupervised approach against a state-of-the-art supervised cell-counting network on the VGG Cells dataset and show that it is not only competitive but also able to precisely locate individual cells. We demonstrate the power of this method by segmenting bright-field images of cell cultures, images from a live/dead assay of C. elegans, and X-ray computed tomography of metallic nanowire meshes. Labelling training data to train machine learning models is very time intense. A new method shows that content transformation can be effectively learned from generated data, avoiding the need for any manual labelling in segmentation and classification tasks.",,Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,15.508,,NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/01/563734.full.pdf,

A critical step in radiation therapy planning is to accurately delineate all organs at risk (OARs) to minimize potential adverse effects to healthy surrounding organs. However, manually delineating OARs based on computed tomography images is time-consuming and error-prone. Here, we present a deep learning model to automatically delineate OARs in head and neck, trained on a dataset of 215 computed tomography scans with 28 OARs manually delineated by experienced radiation oncologists. On a hold-out dataset of 100 computed tomography scans, our model achieves an average Dice similarity coefficient of 78.34% across the 28 OARs, significantly outperforming human experts and the previous state-of-the-art method by 10.05% and 5.18%, respectively. Our model takes only a few seconds to delineate an entire scan, compared to over half an hour by human experts. These findings demonstrate the potential for deep learning to improve the quality and reduce the treatment planning time of radiation therapy. To keep radiation therapy from damaging healthy tissue, expert radiologists have to segment CT scans into individual organs. A new deep learning-based method for delineating organs in the area of head and neck performs faster and more accurately than human experts.","CONVENTIONAL 2-DIMENSIONAL RADIOTHERAPY,INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY,LOCALLY ADVANCED HEAD,PHASE-III TRIAL,AUTO-SEGMENTATION,INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY,ADVANCED LARYNGEAL,LATE TOXICITY,NECK-CANCER,CHEMORADIOTHERAPY",Article,"SPRINGERNATURE, CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Computer Science,,15.508,"CONVENTIONAL,2-DIMENSIONAL,RADIOTHERAPY,INTENSITY-MODULATED,RADIOTHERAPY,LOCALLY,ADVANCED,HEAD,PHASE-III,TRIAL,AUTO-SEGMENTATION,INDUCTION,CHEMOTHERAPY,ADVANCED,LARYNGEAL,LATE,TOXICITY,NECK-CANCER,CHEMORADIOTHERAPY",NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE,,

S.,Rajalakshmi P.","Jagadish B,Mishra PK,Kiran MPRS,Rajalakshmi P",Jagadish B,10.1162/neco_a_01223,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System),"In this letter, we propose two novel methods for four-class motor imagery (MI) classification using electroencephalography (EEG). Also, we developed a real-time health 4.0 (H4.0) architecture for brain-controlled internet of things (IoT) enabled environments (BCE), which uses the classified MI task to assist disabled persons in controlling IoT-enabled environments such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). The first method for classification involves a simple and low-complex classification framework using a combination of regularized Riemannian mean (RRM) and linear SVM. Although this method performs better compared to state-of-the-art techniques, it still suffers from a nonnegligible misclassification rate. Hence, to overcome this, the second method offers a persistent decision engine (PDE) for the MI classification, which improves classification accuracy (CA) significantly. The proposed methods are validated using an in-house recorded four-class MI data set (data set I, collected over 14 subjects), and a four-class MI data set 2a of BCI competition IV (data set II, collected over 9 subjects). The proposed RRM architecture obtained average CAs of 74.30% and 67.60% when validated using datasets I and II, respectively. When analyzed along with the proposed PDE classification framework, an average CA of 92.25% on 12 subjects of data set I and 82.54% on 7 subjects of data set II is obtained. The results show that the PDE algorithm is more reliable for the classification of four-class MI and is also feasible for BCE applications. The proposed low-complex BCE architecture is implemented in real time using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ along with the Virgo EEG data acquisition system. The hardware implementation results show that the proposed system architecture is well suited for body-wearable devices in the scenario of Health 4.0. We strongly feel that this study can aid in driving the future scope of BCE research.",MULTICLASS MOTOR IMAGERY,Article,"MIT PRESS, ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA","Computer Science,Neurosciences & Neurology",,2.618,"MULTICLASS,MOTOR,IMAGERY",NEURAL COMPUTATION,,

The key aspect in this process is the ability to relate features derived from the recorded sensor signals to the physical condition of the monitored asset in real time. This paper uses simple machine learning techniques to examine the ability of specific time-domain features obtained from vibration signals to predict the progression of surface distress in lubricated, rolling-sliding contacts, such as those found in rolling bearings and gears. Controlled experiments were performed on a triple-disc rolling contact fatigue rig using seeded-fault roller specimens where micropitting damage was generated and its progression directly observed over millions of contact cycles. Vibration signals were recorded throughout the experiments. Features known as condition indicators were then extracted from the recorded time-domain signals and their evolution related to the observed physical state of the associated specimens using simple machine learning techniques. Five time-domain condition indicators were examined, peak-to-peak, root-mean-square, kurtosis, crest factor and skewness, three of which were found not to be redundant. First, a classification model using KNN nearest neighbor was built with the three informative condition indicators as training data. The cross-validation results indicated that this classifier was able to predict the presence of micropitting damage with a relatively high precision and a low rate of false positives. Secondly, a k-means clustering analysis was performed to measure the significance of each condition indicator by leveraging patterns. The peak-to-peak condition indicator was found to be a good predictor for progression of micropitting damage. In addition, this indicator was able to distinguish between micropitting and pitting failure modes with a high success rate. Finally, the condition indicator response was correlated with the predicted damage state of the test specimen obtained through an existing physics-based surface distress model in order to illustrate the potential of hybrid models for improved prognostics of damage progression in rolling-sliding tribological contacts.","Condition indicator,condition monitoring,data mining,diagnostics,micropitting,prognostics,rolling bearings,rolling contact fatigue",Article,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD, 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Engineering,,1.777,"FATIGUE,PROPAGATION,CRACKS,DAMAGE,MODEL",PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY,,

It is especially important to correctly identify other people's emotional information in social communication. Therefore, emotion recognition is also a hot issue in intelligent information processing. This paper focuses on this problem, mainly based on the feature selection method in emotional recognition of EEG signals. How to select emotion-related features in high-dimensional features is a key factor to achieve fast, accurate and effective identification. This paper proposes a feature selection method based on sparse learning. The method can find a small number of features that contribute to the reconstruction of the category information from the high-dimensional feature space, so as to achieve the purpose of quickly and efficiently acquiring small and emotionally related features. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional method, the proposed method reduces the time consumption of feature selection and obtains a higher emotional five-category correct rate under the same feature dimension.","Social communication EEG,Emotion recognition,Feature selection,Sparse learning",Article,"SPRINGER LONDON LTD, 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","Engineering,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,1.998,,SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING,,
