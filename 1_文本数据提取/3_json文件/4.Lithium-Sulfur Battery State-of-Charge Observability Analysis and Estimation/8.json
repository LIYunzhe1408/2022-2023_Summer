{"content": "DEVELOPMENT of energy storage systems can beconsidered as the heart of vehicle electriﬁcation process. Different new technologies for batteries, fuel cells, ultraca-pacitors, etc., are developing to be implemented in electric vehicles (EVs). One such new energy storage technology is the Lithium–Sulfur (Li-S) battery. Compared to incumbent Li-ion technologies, Li-S batteries have higher speciﬁc energy, im- proved safety, wider operational temperature range, and – when productionized – a lower unit cost due to the wide availabilityof sulfur, and consequently, Li-S is receiving serious research attention.", "records": [{"span": "electric vehicles", "offset": [217, 233], "tag": "Application"}, {"span": "EVs", "offset": [236, 238], "tag": "Application"}, {"span": "Lithium–Sulfur", "offset": [288, 301], "tag": "Composition"}]}
