{"content": "Li-S cell’s internal resistance and OCV are obtained for the experiment described in previous section (see Fig. 3). Referring to Fig. 1, the Li-S SOC range can be divided into two parts, usually referred to as the “high plateau” (HP) and “low plateau”(LP).  There is a breakpoint at around 75% SOC that determines the boundary between the two plateaus.", "records": [{"span": "internal resistance", "offset": [12, 30], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "high plateau", "offset": [215, 226], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "HP", "offset": [230, 231], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "low plateau", "offset": [239, 249], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "LP", "offset": [252, 253], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "75% SOC", "offset": [290, 296], "tag": "Condition"}]}
