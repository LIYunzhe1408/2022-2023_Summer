{"content": "In Fig. 17, Li-S cell SOC calculation using coulomb counting and the hybrid technique are illustrated over UDDS test at 30 degree C. The test started from 80% SOC, but the initial value was not provided to any of the algorithms. Since the estima- tion algorithms do not know about the initial condition, both are started from 50% SOC.  As demonstrated in the Ô¨Ågure, the hybrid technique is able to converge to a close bound around the right value of SOC by using ANFIS capabilities.", "records": [{"span": "30 degree C", "offset": [120, 130], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "80% SOC", "offset": [155, 161], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "50% SOC", "offset": [326, 332], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "ANFIS ", "offset": [463, 468], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
