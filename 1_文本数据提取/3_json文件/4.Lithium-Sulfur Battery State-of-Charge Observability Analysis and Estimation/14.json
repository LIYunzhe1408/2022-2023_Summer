{"content": "This work was undertaken as a part of an industrial project, aiming to develop and deploy experimental Li-S cells in an automotive application. Regardless of the state of develop- ment of the chemistry, it is important to be able to operate cells in practical applications, and this study is focused on Li-S cell parameter identiﬁcation and state-of-charge (SOC) estimation. There are different methods in the literature for battery SOC estimation [3]–[5]. Good reviews of these methods can be found in [6] and [7]. The most widespread conventional method, used as a benchmark for evaluation of other techniques, is “coulomb-counting.” In this concept, an SOC is estimated by integrating the load current; this way, capacity used and remaining can be estimated. Assuming SOC0 as the initial SOC at time t0 , the cell’s SOC at time t is calculated as follows:", "records": [{"span": "state-of-charge", "offset": [341, 355], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "load current", "offset": [692, 703], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}]}
