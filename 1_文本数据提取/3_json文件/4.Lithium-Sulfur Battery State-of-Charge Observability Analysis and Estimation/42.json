{"content": "The idenﬁcation part is based on the well-known prediction-error minimization algorithm; and the SOC estimator part is an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system in combination with coulomb counting. Using the proposed method, a Li-S cell’s SOC is estimated with a mean error of 4% and maximum error of 7% in a realistic driving scenario.", "records": [{"span": "prediction-error minimization algorithm", "offset": [48, 86], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
