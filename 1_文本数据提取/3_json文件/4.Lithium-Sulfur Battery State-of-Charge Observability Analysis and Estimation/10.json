{"content": "Unlike coulomb-counting, it can start from any initial SOC value and no initial condition data are needed to run the estimator. Unlike coulomb-counting, the whole battery capacity is not needed for SOC calculation. Unlike recursive adaptive Ô¨Ålters, no time is needed for convergence of the algorithm at the beginning. The proposed method is simple and fast enough to be used in real-time applications. In addition, ANFIS models are adaptive and can be retuned very fast.", "records": [{"span": "coulomb-counting", "offset": [7, 22], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "coulomb-counting", "offset": [135, 150], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "ANFIS", "offset": [415, 419], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
