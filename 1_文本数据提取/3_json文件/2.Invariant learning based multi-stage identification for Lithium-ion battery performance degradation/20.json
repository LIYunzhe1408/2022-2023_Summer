{"content": "To be more quan-titative, Dubarry et al. [7] attempted to investigate fading stages through Peukert ˛a´rs coefﬁcient. Furthermore, Yu [8] put forward a degradation stage identiﬁcation method using a distribution-based correlation index, which measured thesimilarity between the historic Gaussian components and thenew Gaussian components. In this way, a whole degradation stage was classiﬁed into a health state, slight degradation state, and severe degradation state by checking the value of the deﬁned index.", "records": [{"span": "distribution-based correlation index", "offset": [199, 234], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
