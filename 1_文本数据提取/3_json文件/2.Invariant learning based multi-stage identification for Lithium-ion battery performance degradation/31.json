{"content": "According to the selection strategy given in Section III.B, three stationary sources are retained using ADF test, which could indicate the stationary of a variable by judging the existence of unit root. Fig. 5 visualizes these stationary sources, which present invariant across cycles. This proves that inferences that there may be consistent dynamics over cycles", "records": [{"span": "ADF", "offset": [104, 106], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
