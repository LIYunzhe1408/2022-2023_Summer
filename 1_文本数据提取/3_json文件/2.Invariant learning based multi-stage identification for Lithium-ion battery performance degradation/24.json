{"content": "In this article, an invariant-learning based sequential stage division method is proposed, which is capable of providing reliable and unique results. The invariant is designed with the characteristics that it is statistically consistent in the same stage while it is different across stages. That is, they are sensitive to the changes in degradation speed. As a result, the identiÔ¨Åcation of different stages can be iteratively achieved by monitoring the changes of the invariants.", "records": [{"span": "invariant-learning", "offset": [20, 37], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
