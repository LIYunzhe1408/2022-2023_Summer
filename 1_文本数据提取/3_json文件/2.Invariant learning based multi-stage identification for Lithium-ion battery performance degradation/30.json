{"content": "First, dynamics hidden behind process variables are unfolded in the framework of phase subspace, yielding reconstructed data. Next, invariants indicat-ing degradation trend are decomposed by linear superposition of the reconstructed data, which are computed using cycling SSA. Third, the monitoring strategy on invariants is given, distinguishing degradation stages from each other.", "records": [{"span": "phase subspace", "offset": [81, 94], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "cycling SSA", "offset": [264, 274], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
