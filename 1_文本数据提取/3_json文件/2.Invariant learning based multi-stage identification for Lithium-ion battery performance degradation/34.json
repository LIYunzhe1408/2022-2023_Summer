{"content": "To probe into the degradation mechanism of LiB from data-driven perspective, this article puts forward a multi-stage division for the Ô¨Årst time in improving process insights. In-depth analysis is achieved through three main parts, including data reconstruction in phase subspace, invariant learning with improved cycling stationary subspace analysis, and a stage division strategy. According to the simulation results, implicit dynamics could be unfolded with data reconstruction, indicat- ing the evolution of sequential cycling data. Invariants could be effectively learned and used for indication of degradation switch. Additionally, it would be interesting to apply this idea for other topics, such as state of health estimation, and better performances may be achieved.", "records": [{"span": "degradation", "offset": [18, 28], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "phase subspace", "offset": [264, 277], "tag": "Structure"}]}
