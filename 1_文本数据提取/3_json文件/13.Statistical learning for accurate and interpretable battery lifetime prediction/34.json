{"content": "While this model has not been extensively validated for other battery lifetime prediction tasks, Sulzer et al. demonstrated that variance from C/20 discharges is correlated with cycle life for NMC/graphite cells, which suggests that the variance feature generalizes to other datasets with more complex cell chemistries than LFP/graphite (note that this work uses the untransformed variance as opposed to the lg-transformed variance).", "records": [{"span": "C/20", "offset": [143, 146], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "NMC", "offset": [193, 195], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "graphite", "offset": [197, 204], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "LFP", "offset": [324, 326], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "graphite", "offset": [328, 335], "tag": "Composition"}]}
