{"content": "Nevertheless, the thorough study of Euchner et al. [14] revealed that  (1) substituting gate-cation sites occupied by a transition metal with a lithium atom lowers the diffusion barrier,  (2) substituting oxygen atoms in dumbbell sites (two anions in the middle of the straight diffusion path) with fluorine increases the diffusion barrier,  (3) substituting other ligand oxygen atoms could increase or decrease the barrier depending on their sites", "records": [{"span": "gate-cation site", "offset": [88, 103], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "dumbbell site", "offset": [221, 233], "tag": "Structure"}]}
