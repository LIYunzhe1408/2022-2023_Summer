{"content": "The binder/additives volume sensitivity of each resistance is illustrated in Fig.6. The reaction resistance increases linearly since the total surface area decreases with the ratio. Sigillary, approximately linear dependency of the binder/additives volume ratio is observed in the electrolyte resistance and the total resistance.", "records": [{"span": " volume sensitivity", "offset": [20, 38], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "electrolyte resistance", "offset": [281, 302], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}]}
