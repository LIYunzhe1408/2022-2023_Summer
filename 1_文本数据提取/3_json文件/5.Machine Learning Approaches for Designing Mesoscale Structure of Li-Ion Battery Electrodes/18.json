{"content": "In the first step, high-throughput Physico-chemical modeling based on particles aggregated structures are developed.In the second step, the regression model in order to predict the charge/discharge resistance is developed using process parameters as predictors via Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The optimized electrode structures and the process parameters are searched by Bayesian optimization in the final step.", "records": [{"span": "high-throughput Physico-chemical model", "offset": [19, 56], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "regression model", "offset": [140, 155], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Artificial Neural Network", "offset": [265, 289], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "ANN", "offset": [292, 294], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Bayesian optimization", "offset": [376, 396], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
