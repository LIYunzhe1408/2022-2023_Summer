{"content": "Although there is a lot of machine learning models such as LASSO [22] and Ridge regression [23] based on linear regression techniques, ANN based on nonlinear regression is one of the useful tools in order to predict complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find some patterns in datasets [24].  In this model, the process parameters are initialized randomly and implemented the next candidate with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).", "records": [{"span": "linear regression technique", "offset": [105, 131], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation", "offset": [412, 440], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "MLE", "offset": [443, 445], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
