As results, the predicted electrode resistance by ANN regression model is good agreement with the simulated values. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and optimization of the process parameters have been carried out. The proposed data-driven approach could be a solution as a guiding princ iple for manufacturing battery electrode.", "records": [{"span": "manufacturing battery electrode", "offset": [52, 82], "tag": "Application"}, {"span": "ANN regression model", "offset": [135, 154], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
