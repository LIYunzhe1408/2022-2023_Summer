{"content": "In this study, the prediction and optimization scheme of battery porous electrode has been proposed as a guiding principle for manufacturing process. First, High-throughput simulation model based on simplified Physico-chemical equations with artificial 3D structures composed of random packed spheres has been constructed and over 2000 calculations were conducted. Next, the regression models via Artific ial Neural Network have been created in order to predict", "records": [{"span": "High-throughput simulation model", "offset": [157, 188], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "simplified Physico-chemical equation", "offset": [199, 234], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
