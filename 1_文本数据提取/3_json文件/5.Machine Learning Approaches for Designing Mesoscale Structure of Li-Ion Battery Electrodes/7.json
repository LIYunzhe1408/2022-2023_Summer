{"content": "The active material particle radius (2.5 – 12.5 [um]) is extracted randomly with uniform distribution, and spheres are generated in a 50 x 50 x 50 [um3] box until the volume fraction reaches the randomly specified value. Compaction process of electrode (calendaring) affects meso-scale structure of pore region and active material particles. Here, maximum overlap length between active material particles is estimated from compaction pressure P and the number of active material particle using theoretical model [19],", "records": [{"span": "particle", "offset": [20, 27], "tag": "Feature"}, {"span": "radius", "offset": [29, 34], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "2.5 – 12.5 [um]", "offset": [37, 51], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "50 x 50 x 50 [um3]", "offset": [134, 151], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "meso-scale", "offset": [275, 284], "tag": "Structure"}]}
