Table 2 shows the dataset for learning and testing including predictors and descriptors. 70% of the data has been taken at random for training, and remaining data has been used for validation of the ANN using R2 value.", "records": [{"span": "ANN model", "offset": [58, 66], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "regression model", "offset": [86, 101], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
