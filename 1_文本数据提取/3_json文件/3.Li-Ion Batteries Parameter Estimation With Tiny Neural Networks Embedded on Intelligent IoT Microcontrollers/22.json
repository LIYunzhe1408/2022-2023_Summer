{"content": "In the study of Li et al. [16] random forest regression was used to estimate online the capacity of Li-Ion batteries, again using complete charge/discharge cycles as model input. A random decision forest was proposed by Xu et al. [17] for battery health estimation, using one of the Li-Ion battery prognostic datasets made available by NASA [15].", "records": [{"span": "random forest regression", "offset": [31, 54], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "random decision forest", "offset": [181, 202], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
