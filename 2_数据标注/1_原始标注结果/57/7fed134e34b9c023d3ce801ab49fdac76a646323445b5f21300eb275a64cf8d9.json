{"content": "From Fig. 11, the ME and RMSE for these two GPR models are within 0.71Ah and 0.31Ah, which are 32.6% and 13.6% less than those from SEGM. Moreover, comparing to the ‘Model A’ with ARD-SE kernel, ‘Model B’ also achieves the significant improvements for multi-step cyclic capacity prediction cases.", "records": [{"span": "ME", "offset": [18, 19], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "RMSE", "offset": [25, 28], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "GPR model", "offset": [44, 52], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "0.71Ah", "offset": [66, 71], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "0.31Ah", "offset": [77, 82], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "SEGM", "offset": [132, 135], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "cyclic capacity", "offset": [263, 277], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}]}
