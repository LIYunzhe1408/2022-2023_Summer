{"content": "Moreover, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Empyrean, PAN analytical) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific) were conducted for identification of the phase and chemical states of the materials. Based on the Scherrer equation and Archimedes’ principle, the crystallite sizes and relative densities of LAGP were carefully estimated.", "records": [{"span": "X-ray diffraction", "offset": [17, 33], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "XRD", "offset": [36, 38], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy", "offset": [71, 102], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "XPS", "offset": [105, 107], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Scherrer equation", "offset": [236, 252], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Archimedes’ principle", "offset": [258, 278], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
