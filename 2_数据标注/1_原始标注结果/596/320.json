{"content": "Here, we demonstrate that thin Cr protection layers between Li and LAGP extend stable cycling times by more than an order of magnitude (from âˆ¼30 h to >1000 h), and we also show that this improved stability is due to altered morphological growth trajectories of the interphase instead of complete prevention of interphase growth.", "records": [{"span": "Cr", "offset": [31, 32], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "Li", "offset": [60, 61], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "LAGP", "offset": [67, 70], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "cycling times", "offset": [86, 98], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}]}
