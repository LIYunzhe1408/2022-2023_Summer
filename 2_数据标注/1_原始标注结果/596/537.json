{"content": "We identified NaV2(PO4)3 as a viable high-energy cathode candidate for CIBs owing to its distinct crystal structure as discussed above, the similarity in ionic radii between Ca2+ (100 pm) and Na+ (102 pm),38 the relatively high operation voltage (due to the inductive effect of the poly-oxyanionic structure), and the plausible three-dimensional Ca diffusion pathway networks in the structure suggested by the bond-valence-sum difference maps (BVS-DMs).", "records": [{"span": "NaV2(PO4)3", "offset": [14, 23], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "CIBs", "offset": [71, 74], "tag": "Application"}, {"span": "rystal", "offset": [99, 104], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "Ca", "offset": [346, 347], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "diffusion pathway networks", "offset": [349, 374], "tag": "Feature"}, {"span": "bond-valence-sum difference maps", "offset": [410, 441], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
