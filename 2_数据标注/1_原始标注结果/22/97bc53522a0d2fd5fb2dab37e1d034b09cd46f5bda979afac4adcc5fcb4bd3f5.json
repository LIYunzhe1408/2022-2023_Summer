{"content": "Measurable battery parameters such as terminal voltage, current and temperature, can be extracted via the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus [12], and can be used for capacity fading and SoH estimation. Weng et al. [13] developed a model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR), using partially charging data of a single Li-Ion cell to estimate capacity fading of other 7 cells..", "records": [{"span": "terminal voltage", "offset": [38, 53], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "current", "offset": [56, 62], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "temperature", "offset": [68, 78], "tag": "Condition"}, {"span": "SoH", "offset": [186, 188], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
