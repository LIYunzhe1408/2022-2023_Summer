{"content": "NNs energy consumption is crucial in battery constrained embedded applications [48], and the use of a quantized model can be very convenient in reducing energy costs. In order to compare the energy cost of the non-quantized CNN model with the quantized one, the inference energy consumption was modeled according to Horowitz [49], considering a typ- ical processing hardware platform for CNNs [48], [50].", "records": [{"span": "non-quantized CNN", "offset": [210, 226], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
