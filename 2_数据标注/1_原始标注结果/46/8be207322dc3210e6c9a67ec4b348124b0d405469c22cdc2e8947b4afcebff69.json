{"content": "Since publication of the Severson et al. dataset, others have applied advanced machine learning and deep learning methods, including relevance vector machines, gradient boosted regression trees, Gaussian process regression, recurrent neural networks (including long short-term memory networks), and convolutional neural networks. Many of these works have explored creative approaches, including data augmentation and the use of differential capacity analysis.", "records": [{"span": "relevance vector machine", "offset": [133, 156], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "gradient boosted regression tree", "offset": [160, 191], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Gaussian process regression", "offset": [195, 221], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "recurrent neural network", "offset": [224, 247], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "convolutional neural network", "offset": [299, 326], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
