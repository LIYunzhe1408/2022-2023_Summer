{"content": "Recently, parametric studies and sensitivity analyses of the process parameters using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) combined with the Physico-chemical models have been carried out In this study, we propose the prediction and optimization scheme of three-dimensional porous electrode of Li-ion battery using high-throughput simulation model and machine learning techniques. First, the high-throughput Physico-chemical modeling based on particles aggregated structures assuming positive electrode are developed and the database of the relationship between the process parameters and the battery performance are construct. Next, development of the regression model of the battery resistance and capacity are created using controllable condition parameters (Active material volume fraction, size etc.)  via ANN. Finally, the optimized electrode structures and the process parameters are searched by Bayesian optimization.", "records": [{"span": "Artificial Neural Networks", "offset": [86, 111], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "ANNs", "offset": [114, 117], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Physico-chemical model", "offset": [138, 159], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "high-throughput simulation model", "offset": [311, 342], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "high-throughput Physico-chemical modeling", "offset": [388, 428], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "particles aggregated structure", "offset": [439, 468], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "regression model", "offset": [649, 664], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Bayesian optimization", "offset": [899, 919], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
