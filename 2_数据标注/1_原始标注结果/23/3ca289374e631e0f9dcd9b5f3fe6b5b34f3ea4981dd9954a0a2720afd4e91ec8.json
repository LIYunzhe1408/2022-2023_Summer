{"content": "Bayesian optimization with the ANN model. The results indicated that the active material composed of small size particles should be packed near 50% with small amount of binder/additives. As results of further calculations in the conditions that the active material volume fraction is fixed from 0.5 to 0.8, this parameter set is the best also in the higher capac ity conditions.", "records": [{"span": "Bayesian optimization", "offset": [0, 20], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "ANN model", "offset": [31, 39], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
