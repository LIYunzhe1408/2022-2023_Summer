{"content": "Over 2,000 artificial 3D structures assuming positive electrode composed of random packed spheres as active material partic les are generated, and charge/discharge resistance has been evaluated using simplified Physico-chemical model. In this model, resistance from Li diffusion in active material partic les (diffusion resistance), transfer resistance of Li+ in electrolyte (electrolyte resistance) and reaction resistance on the interface between active material and electrolyte are simulated based on mass balance of Li, Ohmâ€™s law in and linearized Butler-Volmer equation, respectively. Using these simulation results, regression models via Artific ial Neural Network (ANN) have been created in order to predict charge/discharge resistance from porous structure features. In this study, porosity, active material particle size and volume fraction, pressure in the compaction process, electrolyte conductivity, and binder/additives volume fraction are adopted as features,", "records": [{"span": "packed sphere", "offset": [83, 95], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "Physico-chemical model", "offset": [211, 232], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Li ", "offset": [266, 268], "tag": "Composition"}, {"span": "electrolyte resistance", "offset": [376, 397], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "reaction resistance", "offset": [404, 422], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}, {"span": "linearized Butler-Volmer equation", "offset": [541, 573], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "regression model", "offset": [622, 637], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "Artific ial Neural Network", "offset": [644, 669], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "ANN", "offset": [672, 674], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "porous", "offset": [748, 753], "tag": "Structure"}, {"span": "electrolyte conductivity", "offset": [887, 910], "tag": "Property_Behavior"}]}
