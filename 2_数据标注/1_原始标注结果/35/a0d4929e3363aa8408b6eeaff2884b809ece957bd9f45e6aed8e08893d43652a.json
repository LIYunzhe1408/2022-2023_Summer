{"content": "Abstract—By informing accurate performance (e.g., capacity),health state management plays a signiﬁcant role in safeguard-ing battery and its powered system. While most current ap-proaches are primary based on data-driven methods, lacking in-depth analysis of battery performance degradation mechanismmay discount their performances. To ﬁll in the research gapabout data-driven battery performance degradation analysis,an invariant-learning based method is proposed to investigatewhether the battery performance degradation follows a ﬁxedbehavior. First, to unfold the hidden dynamics of cycling batterydata, measurements are reconstructed in phase subspace.", "records": [{"span": "invariant-learning", "offset": [421, 438], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "phase subspace", "offset": [642, 655], "tag": "Structure"}]}
