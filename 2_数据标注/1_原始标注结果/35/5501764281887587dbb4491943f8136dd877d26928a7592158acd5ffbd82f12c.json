{"content": "In this section, the proposed multi-stage identiﬁcation ap-proach is veriﬁed with a well-known benchmark for LiB study. This benchmark is released by NASA . Four battery datasets that have been widely used in many previous researches [2]-[4] are employed. The speciﬁcs of these datasets are described in Table I. Due to page limitation, only B0005 is carefully analyzed to illustrate performances with respect to data reconstruction, invariant learning, and the degradation stage division. Besides, division results of degradation stage for other batteries are shown.", "records": [{"span": "multi-stage identiﬁcation", "offset": [30, 54], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
