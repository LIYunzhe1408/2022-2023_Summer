{"content": "To solve stationary source Ss , Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) [14] is employed to measure the distributions between Ss and Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. Correspondingly, Bs corresponding to minimal KLD is the optimal. In this way, the purpose of solving stationary source equals to Ô¨Ånding the optimal Bs .", "records": [{"span": "Kullback-Leibler divergence", "offset": [32, 58], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "KLD", "offset": [61, 63], "tag": "Characterization"}, {"span": "KLD", "offset": [228, 230], "tag": "Characterization"}]}
